The effect of operating lights on laminar flow

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> strength</span></strong> with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s to suppress superconductivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s on the metallic state is poorly understood. We report the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> magnetoresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190. We find that the metallic state exposed by suppressing superconductivity is characterized by magnetoresistance that is linear in magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s up to 80 tesla. The magnitude of the linear-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields
<p>Gas transport through metal-organic framework membranes (MOFs) was switched in situ by applying an external electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> (E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>). The switching of gas permeation upon E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> polarization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices. Permeation measurements under a direct-current E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> poling of 500 volts per millimeter showed reversibly controlled switching of the ZIF-8 into polar polymorphs, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations. The stiffening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability. Dielectric spectroscopy, polarization, and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed low-frequency resonances of ZIF-8 that we attribute to lattice flexibility and linker movement. Upon E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> polarization, we observed a defibrillation of the different lattice motions.</p>

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo
<p>High magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s suppress cuprate superconductivity to reveal an unusual density wave (DW) state coexisting with unexplained quantum oscillations. Although routinely labeled a charge density wave (CDW), this DW state could actually be an electron-pair density wave (PDW). To search for evidence of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>-induced PDW, we visualized modulations in the density of electronic states <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) within the halo surrounding Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> vortex cores. We detected numerous phenomena predicted for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>-induced PDW, including two sets of particle-hole symmetric <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) modulations with wave vectors <bold><i>Q<sub>P</sub></i></bold> and <bold>2<i>Q</i><sub>P</sub></bold>, with the latter decaying twice as rapidly from the core as the former. These data imply that the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>-induced state in underdoped superconducting cuprates is a PDW, with approximately eight CuO<sub>2</sub> unit-cell periodicity and coexisting with its secondary CDWs.</p>

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents—the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in photonics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> in three-dimensional photonic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in photonics.</p>

Local transformations of the hippocampal cognitive map
<p>Grid cells are neurons active in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s arranged in a hexagonal lattice and are thought to represent the “universal metric for space.” However, they become nonhomogeneously distorted in polarized enclosures, which challenges this view. We found that local changes to the configuration of the enclosure induce individual grid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s to shift in a manner inversely related to their distance from the reconfigured boundary. The grid remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling. Shifts in simultaneously recorded colocalized grid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s were strongly correlated, which suggests that the readout of the animal’s position might still be intact. Similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> shifts were also observed in place and boundary cells—albeit of greater magnitude and more pronounced closer to the reconfigured boundary—which suggests that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between these three different cell types.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger

Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave result.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravimetri</span></strong>cally in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> applicable methods for ARQ measurement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to measure air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of measuring ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> measurement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors measurement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ measurements for both laboratory and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> research.</p>

Cysteine-rich peptides promote interspecific genetic isolation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Reproductive isolation is a prerequisite for speciation. Failure of communication between female tissues of the pistil and paternal pollen tubes imposes hybridization barriers in flowering plants. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> LURE1 (AtLURE1) peptides and their male receptor PRK6 aid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion of the growing pollen tube to the ovule. Here, we report that the knockout of the entire <i>AtLURE1</i> gene family did not affect fertility, indicating that AtLURE1-PRK6–mediated signaling is not required for successful fertilization within one <i>Arabidopsis</i> species. AtLURE1s instead function as pollen tube emergence accelerators that favor conspecific pollen over pollen from other species and thus promote reproductive isolation. We also identified maternal peptides XIUQIU1 to -4, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong> pollen tubes regardless of species. Cooperation between ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion and pollen tube growth acceleration favors conspecific fertilization and promotes reproductive isolation.</p>

Measuring Hall viscosity of graphene’s electron fluid
<p>An electrical conductor subjected to a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> exhibits the Hall effect in the presence of current flow. Here, we report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in electron systems with high viscosity. We found that the viscous electron fluid in graphene responds to nonquantizing magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s by producing an electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> opposite to that generated by the ordinary Hall effect. The viscous contribution is substantial and identified by studying local voltages that arise in the vicinity of current-injecting contacts. We analyzed the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extracted the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiments.</p>

Inverse-designed metastructures that solve equations
<p>Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving integral equations using monochromatic electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s. For an arbitrary wave as the input function to an equation associated with a prescribed integral operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic integral equation and using a set of waveguides as the input and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and integrable computing elements.</p>

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field

But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious magnetic sense, do we ever use it?

The experiment recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in brain waves of a certain frequency.

Observation and stabilization of photonic Fock states in a hot radio-frequency resonator
<p>Detecting weak radio-frequency electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s plays a crucial role in a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s, from radio astronomy to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> is a single photon. Detecting and manipulating single photons at megahertz frequencies presents a challenge because, even at cryogenic temperatures, thermal fluctuations are appreciable. Using a gigahertz superconducting qubit, we observed the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency resonator, cooled it to the ground state, and stabilized Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we observed its rethermalization with nanosecond resolution. Extending circuit quantum electrodynamics to the megahertz regime, we have enabled the exploration of thermodynamics at the quantum scale and allowed interfacing quantum circuits with megahertz systems such as spin systems or macroscopic mechanical oscillators.</p>

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale

These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> and show displacement of the magnetic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale magnetic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric magnetic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree magnetic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of magnetic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in metals imposes a trade-off between optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-metal heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and metal rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and metal is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single microwave photon. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> gradient from a nearby micromagnet.

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels

Tuning quantum nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics
<p>The response of electron systems to electrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s that change rapidly in space is endowed by unique features, including an exquisite spatial nonlocality.

The near-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> imaging experiments reveal a parameter-free match with the full quantum description of the massless Dirac electron gas, which involves three types of nonlocal quantum effects: single-particle velocity matching, interaction-enhanced Fermi velocity, and interaction-reduced compressibility.

<p>The magnetopause deflects the solar wind plasma and confines Earth’s magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and magnetic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the magnetopause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> strength</span></strong>, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>, reveals a complex topology with the creation of magnetic ropes at the boundary.</p>

Gravity field of the Orientale basin from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Mission
<p>The Orientale basin is the youngest and best-preserved major impact structure on the Moon. We used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>y Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> of Orientale at 3- to 5-kilometer (km) horizontal resolution. A volume of at least (3.4 ± 0.2) × 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of crustal material was removed and redistributed during basin formation. There is no preserved evidence of the transient crater that would reveal the basin’s maximum volume, but its diameter may now be inferred to be between 320 and 460 km. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> resolves distinctive structures of Orientale’s three rings and suggests the presence of faults associated with the outer two that penetrate to the mantle. The crustal structure of Orientale provides constraints on the formation of multiring basins.</p>

Ultrafast electron diffraction imaging of bond breaking in di-ionized acetylene
<p>Visualizing chemical reactions as they occur requires atomic spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. Here, we report imaging of the molecular structure of acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) 9 femtoseconds after ionization. Using mid-infrared laser–induced electron diffraction (LIED), we obtained snapshots as a proton departs the [C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> ion. By introducing an additional laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>, we also demonstrate control over the ultrafast dissociation process and resolve different bond dynamics for molecules oriented parallel versus perpendicular to the LIED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ed to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion of herbivore predators.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> or the size of pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Structure-Activity Relation of AMOR Sugar Molecule That Activates Pollen-Tubes for Ovular Guidance
<p>Successful fertilization in flowering plants depends on the precise directional growth control of pollen tube through the female pistil tissue toward the female gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the egg cell act as ovular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ants of pollen tubes. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of pollen tubes to these ovular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the pollen tube to respond to ovular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta isomer of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induction. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relationships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta isomer of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for pollen germination. This study represents the first structure-activity relationship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar molecule involved in plant reproduction, which opens a way for modification of the molecule without loss of activity.</p>

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p>Pollen tube guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduction. The pollen tube that grows from pollen, which is the male gametophyte, precisely navigates to the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic pollen tube guidance. Multiple species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the pollen tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic pollen tube guidance is reviewed, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attract</span></strong>ion by synergid cells, control of pollen tube guidance by female gametes, and directional growth of the pollen tube by directional cue sensing. Future directions in the study of pollen tube guidance also are discussed.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging neutron stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>y and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all neutron star mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

Monitoring and manipulating Higgs and Goldstone modes in a supersolid quantum gas
<p>Higgs and Goldstone modes are collective excitations of the amplitude and phase of an order parameter that is related to the breaking of a continuous symmetry. We directly studied these modes in a supersolid quantum gas created by coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate to two optical cavities, whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> amplitudes form the real and imaginary parts of a U(1)-symmetric order parameter. Monitoring the cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s in real time allowed us to observe the dynamics of the associated Higgs and Goldstone modes and revealed their amplitude and phase nature. We used a spectroscopic method to measure their frequencies, and we gave a tunable mass to the Goldstone mode by exploring the crossover between continuous and discrete symmetry. Our experiments link spectroscopic measurements to the theoretical concept of Higgs and Goldstone modes.</p>

Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves

Compacted dimensions and singular plasmonic surfaces

Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene
<p>The distinct Landau level spectrum of bilayer graphene (BLG) is predicted to support a non-abelian even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state similar to the [Formula] state first identified in GaAs. However, the nature of this state has remained difficult to characterize. Here, we report transport measurements of a robust sequence of even-denominator FQH in dual-gated BLG devices. Parallel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> measurement confirms the spin-polarized nature of the ground state, which is consistent with the Pfaffian/anti-Pfaffian description. The sensitivity of the even-denominator states to both filling fraction and transverse displacement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> provides new opportunities for tunability. Our results suggest that BLG is a platform in which topological ground states with possible non-abelian excitations can be manipulated and controlled.</p>

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields
<p>Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within neuronal circuits. We discovered that place <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s could be produced in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of input that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The potentiated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies inputs that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This plasticity efficiently stores entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.</p>

The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices

The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s of only a few tesla.

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence time defines the clock stability, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral precision goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the stability of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a precision in frequency estimation scaling in time <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>s with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong>. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">field</span></strong> and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.</p>

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic hole-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity under long-term heating, although their operational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity was poor. This in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins designed using this code and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein folding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization, and evolution.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity.</p>

Near-atomic model of microtubule-tau interactions
<p>Tau is a developmentally regulated axonal protein that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izes and bundles microtubules (MTs). Its hyperphosphorylation is thought to cause detachment from MTs and subsequent aggregation into fibrils implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. It is unclear which tau residues are crucial for tau-MT interactions, where tau binds on MTs, and how it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izes them. We used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize different tau constructs on MTs and computational approaches to generate atomic models of tau-tubulin interactions. The conserved tubulin-binding repeats within tau adopt similar extended structures along the crest of the protofilament, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izing the interface between tubulin dimers.

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001).

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity provides an alternative dimension, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation
<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the control of histone modification and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and lung injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of CBP reduced the extent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in mouse lung epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14. Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and attenuated LPS-stimulated histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms through which CBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity is regulated by FBXL19 and USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes.</p>

Methylammonium-free, high-performance, and stable perovskite solar cells on a planar architecture
<p>Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performances greater than 20% contain bromine (Br), causing a suboptimal bandgap, and the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. Avoiding Br and especially MA can therefore result in more optimal bandgaps and stable perovskites. We show that inorganic cation tuning, using rubidium and cesium, enables highly crystalline formamidinium-based perovskites without Br or MA. On a conventional, planar device architecture, using polymeric interlayers at the electron- and hole-transporting interface, we demonstrate an efficiency of 20.35% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized), one of the highest for MA-free perovskites, with a drastically improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity reached without the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izing influence of mesoporous interlayers. The perovskite is not heated beyond 100°C. Going MA-free is a new direction for perovskites that are inherently stable and compatible with tandems or flexible substrates, which are the main routes commercializing PSCs.</p>

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>.

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of MLA immune receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling.

A human postcatalytic spliceosome structure reveals essential roles of metazoan factors for exon ligation
<p>During exon ligation, the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> spliceosome recognizes the 3′-splice site (3′SS) of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) through non–Watson-Crick pairing with the 5′SS and the branch adenosine, in a conformation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized by Prp18 and Prp8. Here we present the 3.3-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of a human postcatalytic spliceosome just after exon ligation. The 3′SS docks at the active site through conserved RNA interactions in the absence of Prp18. Unexpectedly, the metazoan-specific FAM32A directly bridges the 5′-exon and intron 3′SS of pre-mRNA and promotes exon ligation, as shown by functional assays. CACTIN, SDE2, and NKAP—factors implicated in alternative splicing—further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ize the catalytic conformation of the spliceosome during exon ligation.

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells
<p>A major bottleneck delaying the further commercialization of thin-film solar cells based on hybrid organohalide lead perovskites is interface loss in state-of-the-art devices.

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity through the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are sites of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the degradation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 degradation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from degradation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for degradation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

Phosphorylation of Arabidopsis MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) Is Required for PAMP Responses and Resistance against Bacteria
<p>Plants perceive potential pathogens via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern recognition receptors, which initiates a series of intracellular responses that ultimately limit bacterial growth. PAMP responses include changes in intracellular protein phosphorylation, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), such as Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MKP1, are important negative regulators of MAPKs and play a crucial role in controlling the intensity and duration of MAPK activation during innate immune signaling. As such, the <i>mkp1</i> mutant lacking MKP1 displays enhanced PAMP responses and resistance against the virulent bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Previous in vitro studies showed that MKP1 can be phosphorylated and activated by MPK6, suggesting that phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for regulating MKP1. We found that MKP1 was phosphorylated during PAMP elicitation and that phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized the protein, resulting in protein accumulation after elicitation. MKP1 also can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that MKP1 is constitutively degraded through the proteasome in the resting state. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we investigated the role of MKP1 posttranslational regulation in plant defense by testing whether phenotypes of the <i>mkp1</i> Arabidopsis mutant could be complemented by expressing phosphorylation site mutations of MKP1. The phosphorylation of MKP1 was found to be required for some, but not all, of MKP1’s functions in PAMP responses and defense against bacteria. Together, our results provide insight into the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of MKP1 during PAMP signaling and resistance to bacteria.</p>

The RING-Type E3 Ligase XBAT35.2 Is Involved in Cell Death Induction and Pathogen Response
<p>XBAT35 belongs to a subfamily of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RING-type E3s that are similar in domain architecture to the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) XA21 Binding Protein3, a defense protein. The <i>XBAT35</i> transcript undergoes alternative splicing to produce two protein isoforms, XBAT35.1 and XBAT35.2. Here, we demonstrate that XBAT35.2 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and is involved in cell death induction and pathogen response. XBAT35.2, but not XBAT35.1, was found to trigger cell death when overexpressed in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and does so in a manner that requires its RING domain. Loss of <i>XBAT35</i> gene function disrupts the plant’s ability to defend against pathogen attack, whereas overexpression of <i>XBAT35.2</i> enhances resistance to pathogens. XBAT35.2 was found to be unstable and promotes its own degradation, suggesting self-regulation. Inoculation with virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 results in a drastic reduction in the levels of ubiquitinated XBAT35.2 and an increase in the abundance of the E3. This implies that pathogen infection prohibits XBAT35.2 self-regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izes the E3. In agreement with a role in defending against pathogens, XBAT35.2 interacts with defense-related Accelerated Cell Death11 (ACD11) in planta and promotes the proteasome-dependent turnover of ACD11 in cell-free degradation assays. In accordance with regulation by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized XBAT35.2, the levels of ubiquitinated ACD11 increased considerably, and the abundance of ACD11 was reduced following pathogen infection. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, treatment of transgenic seedlings with a proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ACD11, confirming proteasome-dependent degradation. Collectively, these results highlight a novel role for XBAT35.2 in cell death induction and defense against pathogens.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts.

Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity shape the DFE.

<p>Laser cooling of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of ions in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong> the plasma expansion, opening avenues for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>-plasma confinement and manipulation.</p>

Severing enzymes amplify microtubule arrays through lattice GTP-tubulin incorporation
<p>Spastin and katanin sever and de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ize microtubules. Paradoxically, despite their destructive activity they increase microtubule mass in vivo. We combined single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy to show that the elemental step in microtubule severing is the generation of nanoscale damage throughout the microtubule by active extraction of tubulin heterodimers. These damage sites are repaired spontaneously by guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–tubulin incorporation, which rejuvenates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izes the microtubule shaft. Consequently, spastin and katanin increase microtubule rescue rates. Furthermore, newly severed ends emerge with a high density of GTP-tubulin that protects them against depolymerization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization of the newly severed plus ends and the higher rescue frequency synergize to amplify microtubule number and mass. Thus, severing enzymes regulate microtubule architecture and dynamics by promoting GTP-tubulin incorporation within the microtubule shaft.</p>

CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction to ethylene via hydroxide-mediated copper catalysis at an abrupt interface
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) electroreduction could provide a useful source of ethylene, but low conversion efficiency, low production rates, and low catalyst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity limit current systems. Here we report that a copper electrocatalyst at an abrupt reaction interface in an alkaline electrolyte reduces CO<sub>2</sub> to ethylene with 70% faradaic efficiency at a potential of −0.55 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Hydroxide ions on or near the copper surface lower the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction and carbon monoxide (CO)–CO coupling activation energy barriers; as a result, onset of ethylene evolution at −0.165 volts versus an RHE in 10 molar potassium hydroxide occurs almost simultaneously with CO production. Operational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity was enhanced via the introduction of a polymer-based gas diffusion layer that sandwiches the reaction interface between separate hydrophobic and conductive supports, providing constant ethylene selectivity for an initial 150 operating hours.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nanograined materials is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated temperatures. As grain size decreases into the nanoscale, grain coarsening occurs at much lower temperatures, as low as ambient temperatures for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low temperatures exhibit notable thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity below a critical grain size.

The inherent thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices.

Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor.

<i>C1orf106</i> is a colitis risk gene that regulates stability of epithelial adherens junctions
<p>Polymorphisms in <i>C1orf106</i> are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated polymorphisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens junction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6.

Consistent with this model, <i>C1orf106</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit defects in the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, a phenotype observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Furthermore, the IBD risk variant increases C1orf106 ubiquitination and turnover with consequent functional impairments.

Dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor with a free-running semiconductor disk laser
<p>Dual-comb spectroscopy offers the potential for high accuracy combined with fast data acquisition. Applications are often limited, however, by the complexity of optical comb systems. Here we present dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor using a substantially simplified single-laser system. Very good spectroscopy measurements with fast sampling rates are achieved with a free-running dual-comb mode-locked semiconductor disk laser. The absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of the optical comb modes is characterized both for free-running operation and with simple microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization.

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence time defines the clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined.

The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.</p>

Visualizing dynamic microvillar search and stabilization during ligand detection by T cells
<p>During immune surveillance, T cells survey the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In searching for peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs), they must solve a classic trade-off between speed and sensitivity. It has long been supposed that microvilli on T cells act as sensory organs to enable search, but their strategy has been unknown. We used lattice light-sheet and quantum dot–enabled synaptic contact mapping microscopy to show that anomalous diffusion and fractal organization of microvilli survey the majority of opposing surfaces within 1 minute. Individual dwell times were long enough to discriminate pMHC half-lives and T cell receptor (TCR) accumulation selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized microvilli. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization was independent of tyrosine kinase signaling and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting selection for avid TCR microclusters.

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators
<p>Topological crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline symmetry leads to topologically protected surface states with a chiral spin texture, rendering them potential candidates for spintronics applications. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of one-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic surface step edges of the three-dimensional topological crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity and protects them from backscattering.

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 protein levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify proteins that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) protein family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB proteins have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for protein complex formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 protein levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated protein PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian oscillator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of circadian oscillator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

A SUMO Ligase AtMMS21 Regulates the Stability of the Chromatin Remodeler BRAHMA in Root Development
<p>Chromatin remodeling is essential for gene expression regulation in plant development and response to stresses. Brahma (BRM) is a conserved ATPase in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and is involved in various biological processes in plant cells, but the regulation mechanism on BRM protein remains unclear. Here, we report that BRM interacts with AtMMS21, a SUMO ligase in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The interaction was confirmed in different approaches in vivo and in vitro. The mutants of <i>BRM</i> and <i>AtMMS21</i> displayed a similar defect in root development. In the <i>mms21-1</i> mutant, the protein level of BRM-GFP was significantly lower than that in wild type, but the RNA level of <i>BRM</i> did not change. Biochemical evidence indicated that BRM was modified by SUMO3, and the reaction was enhanced by AtMMS21. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type AtMMS21 but not the mutated AtMMS21 without SUMO ligase activity was able to recover the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity of BRM in <i>mms21-1</i>.

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>izes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Statistical significant difference between groups   was tested using the chi-squared test, and significance set at p   < 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At one-year follow-up, 14 747 patients were found to have had   a THA after lumbar spinal fusion (12 079 1 to 2 levels, 2594 3 to   7 levels, 74 8+ levels). The control group consisted of 839 004   patients. The dislocation rate in the control group was 1.55%. A   higher rate of dislocation was found in patients with a spinal fusion   of 1 to 2 levels (2.96%, p < 0.0001) and 3 to 7 levels (4.12%,   p < 0.0001). Patients with 3 to 7 levels of fusion had a higher   rate of dislocation than patients with 1 to 2 levels of fusion (odds   ratio (OR) = 1.60, p < 0.0001). When groups were matched for   age and gender to the unfused cohort, patients with 1 to 2 levels   of fusion had an OR of 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to   2.32, p < 0.001), and those with 3 to 7 levels of fusion an OR   of 2.77 (CI 2.04 to 4.80, p < 0.001) for dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with a previous history of lumbar spinal fusion have   a significantly higher rate of dislocation of their THA than age-   and gender-matched patients without a lumbar spinal fusion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:585–91.</p></sec>

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a mean of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two fair (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a mean score of 86.6 (57 to 100). There were 16 excellent results   (35%), 22 good (48%), six fair (13%), and two poor (4%). The mean DASH   score was 15.1 (0 to 55.8). Two patients had delayed wound healing;   four patients had nonunion requiring bone grafting. One patient   had asymptomatic loosening of the radial head prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monteggia-like lesions are rare. With correct identification,   classification, and understanding using CT scans followed by appropriate   surgical treatment that addresses all components of the injury,   good to excellent mid-term results can be achieved.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:212–18.</p></sec>

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac abnormalities causing dependence on the arterial duct for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a shunt usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity and early mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. Duct stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital interventions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS for cardiac conditions with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred seventy-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted. Primary and secondary outcomes of survival and need for extracorporeal support were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Longer-term mortality before repair and reintervention were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. All multivariable analyses accommodated a propensity score to balance patient characteristics between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was an early (to discharge) survival advantage for infants before next-stage surgery in the DS group (odds ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.37–13.14; <i>P</i>=0.012). There was also a difference in the need for postprocedural extracorporeal support in favor of the DS group (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.058). Longer-term survival outcomes showed a reduced risk of death before repair in the DS group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.85; <i>P</i>=0.026) but a slightly increased risk of reintervention (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–2.64; <i>P</i>=0.165).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DS is emerging as a preferred alternative to a surgical shunt for neonatal palliation with evidence for greater postprocedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity and improved patient survival to destination surgical treatment.</p></sec>

NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)-Guided Therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ity, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not significantly improve the combined event rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.37; <i>P</i>=0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus conventional patients, <i>P</i>=0.39). Guided therapy also did not significantly improve any of the secondary end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The PRIMA II trial (Can NT-ProBNP-Guided Therapy During Hospital Admission for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Reduce Mortality and Readmissions?) demonstrates that the guidance of HF therapy to reach an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% after clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ization did not improve 6-month outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.trialregister.nl</ext-link>.

Clinical and Echocardiographic Characteristics and Cardiovascular Outcomes According to Diabetes Status in Patients With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In patients with heart failure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed ejection fraction, little is known about the characteristics of, and outcomes in, those with and without diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and outcomes in the I-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>e trial (Irbesartan in Heart Failure With <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed Ejection Fraction) according to history of diabetes mellitus. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for cardiovascular outcomes adjusted for known predictors, including age, sex, natriuretic peptides, and comorbidity. Echocardiographic data were available in 745 patients and were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally adjusted for in supplementary analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 1134 of 4128 patients (27%) had diabetes mellitus. Compared with those without diabetes mellitus, they were more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (28% versus 22%), higher body mass index (31 versus 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), worse Minnesota Living With Heart Failure score (48 versus 40), higher median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (403 versus 320 pg/mL; all <i>P</i><0.01), more signs of congestion, but no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with diabetes mellitus had a greater left ventricular mass and left atrial area than patients without diabetes mellitus. Doppler E-wave velocity (86 versus 76 cm/s; <i>P</i><0.0001) and the E/e’ ratio (11.7 versus 10.4; <i>P</i>=0.010) were higher in patients with diabetes mellitus. Over a median follow-up of 4.1 years, cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization occurred in 34% of patients with diabetes mellitus versus 22% of those without diabetes mellitus (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.49–2.05), and 28% versus 19% of patients with and without diabetes mellitus died (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.59; confidence interval, 1.33–1.91).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In heart failure with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed ejection fraction, patients with diabetes mellitus have more signs of congestion, worse quality of life, higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and a poorer prognosis. They also display greater structural and functional echocardiographic abnormalities. Further investigation is needed to determine the mediators of the adverse impact of diabetes mellitus on outcomes in heart failure with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed ejection fraction and whether they are modifiable.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants decrease ischemic stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke rate >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke rates below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke rates between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke rates >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke rates and rates corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores. These variations can affect the point score threshold for recommending oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke rates that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

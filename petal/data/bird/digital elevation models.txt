Statistical Inference of Allopolyploid Species Networks in the Presence of Incomplete Lineage Sorting
<p>Polyploidy is an important speciation mechanism, particularly in land plants. Allopolyploid species are formed after hybridization between otherwise intersterile parental species. Recent theoretical progress has led to successful implementation of species tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that take population genetic parameters into account. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have not included allopolyploid hybridization and the special problems imposed when species trees of allopolyploids are inferred. Here, 2 new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for the statistical inference of the evolutionary history of allopolyploids are evaluated using simulations and demonstrated on 2 empirical data sets. It is assumed that there has been a single hybridization event between 2 diploid species resulting in a genomic allotetraploid. The evolutionary history can be represented as a species network or as a multilabeled species tree, in which some pairs of tips are labeled with the same species. In one of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s (AlloppMUL), the multilabeled species tree is inferred directly. This is the simplest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and the most widely applicable, since fewer assumptions are made. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> (AlloppNET) incorporates the hybridization event explicitly which means that fewer parameters need to be estimated. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are implemented in the BEAST framework. Simulations show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are useful and that AlloppNET is more accurate if the assumptions it is based on are valid. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are demonstrated on previously analyzed data from the genera <i>Pachycladon</i> (Brassicaceae) and <i>Silene</i> (Caryophyllaceae).

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of stomatal behavior with a biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> SiriusQuality. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in the detection of adaptation, calling for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Global drainage patterns and the origins of topographic relief on Earth, Mars, and Titan
<p>Rivers have eroded the topography of Mars, Titan, and Earth, creating diverse landscapes. However, the dominant processes that generated topography on Titan (and to some extent on early Mars) are not well known. We analyzed drainage patterns on all three bodies and found that large drainages, which record interactions between deformation and erosional modification, conform much better to long-wavelength topography on Titan and Mars than on Earth. We use a numerical landscape evolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> to demonstrate that short-wavelength deformation causes drainage directions to diverge from long-wavelength topography, as observed on Earth. We attribute the observed differences to ancient long-wavelength topography on Mars, recent or ongoing generation of long-wavelength relief on Titan, and the creation of short-wavelength relief by plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s composed of PVCs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents.

Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12.

Our aim was to investigate the receptor pharmacology, expression pattern, and in vivo function of ELA peptides in the adult cardiovascular system, to seek evidence for alteration in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in which apelin signaling is downregulated, and to demonstrate attenuation of PAH severity with exogenous administration of ELA in a rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><i>In silico</i> docking analysis, competition binding experiments, and downstream assays were used to characterize ELA receptor binding in human heart and signaling in cells expressing the apelin receptor. ELA expression in human cardiovascular tissues and plasma was determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, dual-labeling immunofluorescent staining, and immunoassays. Acute cardiac effects of ELA-32 and [Pyr<sup>1</sup>]apelin-13 were assessed by MRI and cardiac catheterization in anesthetized rats. Cardiopulmonary human and rat tissues from PAH patients and monocrotaline- and Sugen/hypoxia-exposed rats were used to show changes in ELA expression in PAH. The effect of ELA treatment on cardiopulmonary re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing in PAH was investigated in the monocrotaline rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ELA competed for binding of apelin in human heart with overlap for the 2 peptides indicated by <i>in silico</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing. ELA activated G-protein– and β-arrestin–dependent pathways. We detected ELA expression in human vascular endothelium and plasma. Comparable to apelin, ELA increased cardiac contractility, ejection fraction, and cardiac output and elicited vasodilatation in rat in vivo. ELA expression was reduced in cardiopulmonary tissues from PAH patients and PAH rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, respectively. ELA treatment significantly attenuated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation of right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing in monocrotaline-exposed rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results show that ELA is an endogenous agonist of the human apelin receptor, exhibits a cardiovascular profile comparable to apelin, and is downregulated in human disease and rodent PAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, and exogenous peptide can reduce the severity of cardiopulmonary re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing and function in PAH in rats. This study provides additional proof of principle that an apelin receptor agonist may be of therapeutic use in PAH in humans.</p></sec>

Comparative Prognostic Utility of Indexes of Microvascular Function Alone or in Combination in Patients With an Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is frequently successful at restoring coronary artery blood flow in patients with acute ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction; however, failed myocardial reperfusion commonly passes undetected in up to half of these patients. The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a novel invasive measure of coronary microvascular function. We aimed to investigate the pathological and prognostic significance of an IMR>40, alone or in combination with a coronary flow reserve (CFR≤2.0), in the culprit artery after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with acute ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction were prospectively enrolled during emergency percutaneous coronary intervention and categorized according to IMR (≤40 or >40) and CFR (≤2.0 or >2.0). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was acquired 2 days and 6 months after myocardial infarction. All-cause death or first heart failure hospitalization was a prespecified outcome (median follow-up, 845 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IMR and CFR were measured in the culprit artery at the end of percutaneous coronary intervention in 283 patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction (mean±SD age, 60±12 years; 73% male). The median IMR and CFR were 25 (interquartile range, 15–48) and 1.6 (interquartile range, 1.1–2.1), respectively. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of myocardial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–4.27; <i>P</i>=0.042). An IMR>40 was closely associated with microvascular obstruction. Symptom-to-reperfusion time, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) blush grade, and no (≤30%) ST-segment resolution were not associated with these pathologies. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (coefficient, −2.12; 95% confidence interval, −4.02 to −0.23; <i>P</i>=0.028) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (coefficient, 7.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–15.29; <i>P</i>=0.039) at 6 months independently of infarct size. An IMR>40 (odds ratio, 4.36; 95% confidence interval, 2.10–9.06; <i>P</i><0.001) was a multivariable associate of all-cause death or heart failure. Compared with an IMR>40, the combination of IMR>40 and CFR≤2.0 did not have incremental prognostic value.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An IMR>40 is a multivariable associate of left ventricular and clinical outcomes after ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction independently of the infarction size. Compared with standard clinical measures of the efficacy of myocardial reperfusion, including the ischemic time, ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation, angiographic blush grade, and CFR, IMR has superior clinical value for risk stratification and may be considered a reference test for failed myocardial reperfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https//www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs
<p>Learning from a few examples and generalizing to markedly different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce a probabilistic generative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for vision in which message-passing–based inference handles recognition, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified way. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence.</p>

Protein structure determination using metagenome sequence data
<p>Despite decades of work by structural biologists, there are still ~5200 protein families with unknown structure outside the range of comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing.

Permanent human occupation of the central Tibetan Plateau in the early Holocene
<p>Current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of the peopling of the higher-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation zones of the Tibetan Plateau postulate that permanent occupation could only have been facilitated by an agricultural lifeway at ~3.6 thousand calibrated carbon-14 years before present. Here we report a reanalysis of the chronology of the Chusang site, located on the central Tibetan Plateau at an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation of ~4270 meters above sea level. The minimum age of the site is fixed at ~7.4 thousand years (thorium-230/uranium dating), with a maximum age between ~8.20 and 12.67 thousand calibrated carbon-14 years before present (carbon-14 assays). Travel cost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing and archaeological data suggest that the site was part of an annual, permanent, preagricultural occupation of the central plateau. These findings challenge current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of the occupation of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. Network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge network (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble network inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity
<p>Plants are exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, and their ability to respond to environmental variation depends on the proper regulation of gene expression in an organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific manner. Although our knowledge of how stress responses are regulated is accumulating, a genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of how plant transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory elements control spatially specific stress response has yet to emerge. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-regulatory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-salinity (salt) up-regulated genes in the root or the shoot. We used these pCREs to develop computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that can better predict salt up-regulated genes in the root and shoot compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s based on known TF binding motifs. In addition, we incorporated TF binding sites identified via large-scale in vitro assays, chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation, and pCRE combinatorial relationships in machine learning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s and found that only consideration of pCRE combinations led to better performance in salt up-regulation prediction in the root and shoot. Our results suggest that the plant organ transcriptional response to high salinity is regulated by a core set of pCREs and provide a genome-wide view of the cis-regulatory code of plant spatial transcriptional responses to environmental stress.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated immunosuppression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ant transplant immunosuppression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were immunosuppressed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ant immunosuppression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with immunosuppression using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased lung TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ant mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation.</p>

Manganese promotes the aggregation and prion-like cell-to-cell exosomal transmission of α-synuclein
<p>The aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) is considered a key pathophysiological feature of certain neurodegenerative disorders, collectively termed synucleinopathies. Given that a prion-like, cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded αSyn has been recognized in the spreading of αSyn pathology in synucleinopathies, we investigated the biological mechanisms underlying the propagation of the disease with respect to environmental neurotoxic stress. Considering the potential role of the divalent metal manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in protein aggregation, we characterized its effect on αSyn misfolding and transmission in experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of Parkinson’s disease. In cultured dopaminergic neuronal cells stably expressing wild-type human αSyn, misfolded αSyn was secreted through exosomes into the extracellular medium upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. These exosomes were endocytosed through caveolae into primary microglial cells, thereby mounting neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-elicited exosomes exerted a neurotoxic effect in a human dopaminergic neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> (LUHMES cells). Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that Mn<sup>2+</sup> accelerated the cell-to-cell transmission of αSyn, resulting in dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. Welders exposed to Mn<sup>2+</sup> had increased misfolded αSyn content in their serum exosomes. Stereotaxically delivering αSyn-containing exosomes, isolated from Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated αSyn-expressing cells, into the striatum initiated Parkinsonian-like pathological features in mice. Together, these results indicate that Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure promotes αSyn secretion in exosomal vesicles, which subsequently evokes proinflammatory and neurodegenerative responses in both cell culture and animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s.</p>

Modeling chemotherapy-induced stress to identify rational combination therapies in the DNA damage response pathway
<p>Cells respond to DNA damage by activating complex signaling networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA damage repair and survival but also cell death. We have developed a multiscale computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> that quantitatively links chemotherapy-induced DNA damage response signaling to cell fate. The computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was trained and calibrated on extensive data from U2OS osteosarcoma cells, including the cell cycle distribution of the initial cell population, signaling data measured by Western blotting, and cell fate data in response to chemotherapy treatment measured by time-lapse microscopy. The resulting mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> predicted the cellular responses to chemotherapy alone and in combination with targeted inhibitors of the DNA damage response pathway, which we confirmed experimentally. Computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s such as the one presented here can be used to understand the molecular basis that defines the complex interplay between cell survival and cell death and to rationally identify chemotherapy-potentiating drug combinations.</p>

Hyperactive locomotion in a <i>Drosophila</i> model is a functional readout for the synaptic abnormalities underlying fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual disability and autism and affects ~1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. The discovery of effective treatments for FXS has been hampered by the lack of effective animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s and phenotypic readouts for drug screening. FXS ensues from the epigenetic silencing or loss-of-function mutation of the <i>fragile X mental retardation 1</i> (<i>FMR1</i>) gene, which encodes an RNA binding protein that associates with and represses the translation of target mRNAs. We previously found that the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) downstream of augmented synthesis of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 2 receptor (BMPR2) promotes aberrant synaptic development in mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of FXS and that these molecular and cellular markers were correlated in patients with FXS. We report that larval locomotion is augmented in a <i>Drosophila</i> FXS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>. Genetic or pharmacological intervention on the BMPR2-LIMK pathway ameliorated the synaptic abnormality and locomotion phenotypes of FXS larvae, as well as hyperactivity in an FXS mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>. Our study demonstrates that (i) the BMPR2-LIMK pathway is a promising therapeutic target for FXS and (ii) the locomotion phenotype of FXS larvae is a quantitative functional readout for the neuromorphological phenotype associated with FXS and is amenable to the screening novel FXS therapeutics.</p>

Combined adult neurogenesis and BDNF mimic exercise effects on cognition in an Alzheimer’s mouse model
<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is impaired before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. We found that exercise provided cognitive benefit to 5×FAD mice, a mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of AD, by inducing AHN and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neither stimulation of AHN alone, nor exercise, in the absence of increased AHN, ameliorated cognition. We successfully mimicked the beneficial effects of exercise on AD mice by genetically and pharmacologically inducing AHN in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ating BDNF levels. Suppressing AHN later led to worsened cognitive performance and loss of preexisting dentate neurons. Thus, pharmacological mimetics of exercise, enhancing AHN and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ating BDNF levels, may improve cognition in AD. Furthermore, applied at early stages of AD, these mimetics may protect against subsequent neuronal cell death.</p>

Modeling the ecology and evolution of biodiversity: Biogeographical cradles, museums, and graves
<p>Individual processes shaping geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s and traditional experiments. To meet this challenge, we built a spatially explicit, mechanistic simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> implementing adaptation, range shifts, fragmentation, speciation, dispersal, competition, and extinction, driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed climates of the past 800,000 years in South America. Experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topographi</span></strong>c smoothing confirmed the impact of climate heterogeneity on diversification. The simulations identified regions and episodes of speciation (cradles), persistence (museums), and extinction (graves). Although the simulations had no target pattern and were not parameterized with empirical data, emerging richness maps closely resembled contemporary maps for major taxa, confirming powerful roles for evolution and diversification driven by topography and climate.</p>

Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission
<p>Arctic sea ice is retreating rapidly, raising prospects of a future ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer. Because climate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed transient climate response.</p>

By comparing four observational products of sea surface temperature with a large multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> climate forecast ensemble, we find compelling evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent product.

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> green alga.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of flow through the olfactory region (i.e. the olfactory recess plus airspace around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s would have little to no flow through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the olfactory region. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

A necrotic stimulus is required to maximize matrix-mediated myogenesis in mice

In this study, treatment with a collagen-based matrix stimulated molecular myogenesis in an <i>mdx</i> murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of necrosis. Matrix-treated animals ran ≥40% further, demonstrating functional regeneration, and expressed increased levels of myogenic transcripts. By contrast, matrix treatment was unable to induce transcriptional or functional changes in an <i>MLC/SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></i> atrophic mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>. <i>In vitro</i>, satellite cells were cultured under standard conditions, on matrix, in the presence of myocyte debris (to simulate a necrotic-like environment) or with both matrix and necrotic stimuli. Exposure to both matrix and necrotic stimuli induced the greatest increases in <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i>, <i>myoD</i> and myogenin transcripts. Furthermore, conditioned medium collected from satellite cells cultured with both stimuli contained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated levels of factors that modulate satellite cell activation and proliferation, such as FGF-2, HGF and SDF-1. Application of the conditioned medium to C2C12 myoblasts accelerated maturation, as demonstrated by increased <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i> and myogenin transcripts and fusion indexes. In summary, the collagen matrix required a necrotic stimulus to enhance the maturation of satellite cells and their secretion of a myogenic cocktail. Considering that matrix treatment supports myogenesis only in <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that exhibit necrosis, this study demonstrates that a necrotic environment is required to maximize matrix-mediated myogenesis.</p>

An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.</p>

Vascular Smooth Muscle–Specific Progerin Expression Accelerates Atherosclerosis and Death in a Mouse Model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Progerin, an aberrant protein that accumulates with age, causes the rare genetic disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Patients who have HGPS exhibit ubiquitous progerin expression, accelerated aging and atherosclerosis, and die in their early teens, mainly of myocardial infarction or stroke.

Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower specificity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased.

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of pathological re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of intense fibrosis. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of pathological re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac pathological re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</p></sec>

Complement Receptor C5aR1 Plays an Evolutionarily Conserved Role in Successful Cardiac Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Defining conserved molecular pathways in animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of successful cardiac regeneration could yield insight into why adult mammals have inadequate cardiac regeneration after injury. Insight into the transcriptomic landscape of early cardiac regeneration from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> organisms will shed light on evolutionarily conserved pathways in successful cardiac regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here we describe a cross-species transcriptomic screen in 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> organisms for cardiac regeneration: axolotl, neonatal mice, and zebrafish. Apical resection to remove ≈10% to 20% of ventricular mass was carried out in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> organisms. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on the hearts harvested at 3 time points: 12, 24, and 48 hours after resection. Sham surgery was used as internal control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Genes associated with inflammatory processes were found to be upregulated in a conserved manner. Complement receptors (activated by complement components, part of the innate immune system) were found to be highly upregulated in all 3 species. This approach revealed induction of gene expression for complement 5a receptor 1 in the regenerating hearts of zebrafish, axolotls, and mice. Inhibition of complement 5a receptor 1 significantly attenuated the cardiomyocyte proliferative response to heart injury in all 3 species. Furthermore, after left ventricular apical resection, the cardiomyocyte proliferative response was diminished in mice with genetic deletion of complement 5a receptor 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data reveal that activation of complement 5a receptor 1 mediates an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation after cardiac injury and identify complement pathway activation as a common pathway of successful heart regeneration.</p></sec>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Among Men With Primary Elevations of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels of 190 mg/dL or Above
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term exposure to markedly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated LDL-C levels. Therefore, initiation of statin therapy is recommended for these individuals. However, there is a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting these recommendations in primary prevention. In the present analysis, we provide hitherto unpublished data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C lowering among a primary prevention population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We aimed to assess the benefits of LDL-C lowering on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL without preexisting vascular disease at baseline. We performed post hoc analyses from the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) randomized, placebo-controlled trial, and observational posttrial long-term follow-up, after excluding individuals with evidence of vascular disease at baseline. WOSCOPS enrolled 6595 men aged 45 to 64 years, who were randomly assigned to pravastatin 40 mg/d or placebo. In the present analyses, 5529 participants without evidence of vascular disease were included, stratified by LDL-C levels into those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL (n=2969; mean LDL-C 178±6 mg/dL) and those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (n=2560; mean LDL-C 206±12 mg/dL). The effect of pravastatin versus placebo on coronary heart disease and major adverse cardiovascular events were assessed over the 4.9-year randomized controlled trial phase and on mortality outcomes over a total of 20 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 5529 individuals without vascular disease, pravastatin reduced the risk of coronary heart disease by 27% (<i>P</i>=0.002) and major adverse cardiovascular events by 25% (<i>P</i>=0.004) consistently among those with and without LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (<i>P</i>-interaction >0.9).

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Contemporary ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction management involves primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with ongoing studies focusing on infarct size reduction using ancillary therapies. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant with reactive oxygen species scavenging properties that also potentiates the effects of nitroglycerin and thus represents a potentially beneficial ancillary therapy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The NACIAM trial (N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction) examined the effects of NAC on infarct size in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the effects of intravenous high-dose NAC (29 g over 2 days) with background low-dose nitroglycerin (7.2 mg over 2 days) on early cardiac magnetic resonance imaging–assessed infarct size. Secondary end points included cardiac magnetic resonance–determined myocardial salvage and creatine kinase kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 112 randomized patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction, 75 (37 in NAC group, 38 in placebo group) underwent early cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Median duration of ischemia pretreatment was 2.4 hours.

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> score or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> scores measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly.

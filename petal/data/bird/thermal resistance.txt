Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for measurement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity to total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity calculated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the proteome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative modifications of proteins caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the identity of proteins and the residues sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic acid dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified cysteines sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

Systematic Mutagenesis of Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase Reveals an Essential Role in Nematode Resistance
<p><i>Rhg4</i> is a major genetic locus that contributes to soybean cyst nematode (SCN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the Peking-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), which also requires the <i>rhg1</i> gene. By map-based cloning and functional genomic approaches, we previously showed that the <i>Rhg4</i> gene encodes a predicted cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GmSHMT08); however, the novel gain of function of <i>GmSHMT08</i> in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance remains to be characterized. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified an allelic series of <i>GmSHMT08</i> mutants that shed new light on the mechanistic aspects of <i>GmSHMT08</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. The new mutants provide compelling genetic evidence that Peking-type <i>rhg1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cv Forrest is fully dependent on the <i>GmSHMT08</i> gene and demonstrates that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is mechanistically different from the PI 88788-type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance that only requires <i>rhg1</i>. We also demonstrated that <i>rhg1-a</i> from cv Forrest, although required, does not exert selection pressure on the nematode to shift from HG type 7, which further validates the bigenic nature of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Mapping of the identified mutations onto the SHMT structural model uncovered key residues for structural stability, ligand binding, enzyme activity, and protein interactions, suggesting that GmSHMT08 has additional functions aside from its main enzymatic role in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of the <i>GmSHMT08</i> SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene in a transgenic soybean plant.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. To maintain activity across a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e transcriptome becomes derepressed at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e information over the course of the night.</p>

OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast
<p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) blast. SNAREs (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant rice landrace Heikezijing and the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to blast. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i>::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at rice blast penetration sites in transgenic rice, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance are important tools for combating disease. A few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes identified to date provide partial, durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ed, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation process. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 559 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 365 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 295 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the leaves into mild nematode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

Reversion of antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by spiroisoxazoline SMARt-420
<p>Antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is one of the biggest threats to human health globally. Alarmingly, multidrug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant and extensively drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> have now spread worldwide. Some key antituberculosis antibiotics are prodrugs, for which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms are mainly driven by mutations in the bacterial enzymatic pathway required for their bioactivation. We have developed drug-like molecules that activate a cryptic alternative bioactivation pathway of ethionamide in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, circumventing the classic activation pathway in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations have now been observed. The first-of-its-kind molecule, named SMARt-420 (Small Molecule Aborting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance), not only fully reverses ethionamide-acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and clears ethionamide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant infection in mice, it also increases the basal sensitivity of bacteria to ethionamide.</p>

Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance
<p>Crop breeding aims to balance disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance with yield; however, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (R) genes can lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance breakdown, and R gene pyramiding may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice <i>Pigm</i> locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR confers broad-spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. <i>PigmS</i> expression, and thus <i>PigmR</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. <i>PigmS</i> increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by <i>PigmR</i>. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLR receptors, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.</p>

The TRPM2 channel is a hypothalamic heat sensor that limits fever and can drive hypothermia
<p>Body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the nervous system. The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and regulates internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons. TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels in monitoring internal body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e should promote further analysis of molecular mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic circuits involved with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis.</p>

A Cytosolic Triosephosphate Isomerase Is a Key Component in XA3/XA26-Mediated Resistance
<p>Bacterial blight caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) causes severe damage to rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. The major disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>, confers broad-spectrum and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i> at both seedling and adult stages. However, the molecular mechanism of the <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>-initiated defense pathway against <i>Xoo</i> is still largely unknown. Here, we show that a triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), OsTPI1.1, is a key component in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. OsTPI1.1 is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Transcriptional suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in plants harboring <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> largely impaired the XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>, and constitutive overexpression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in susceptible rice plants without <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> only slightly decreased the susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>. Therefore, both XA3/XA26 and OsTPI1.1 are required in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. We show that OsTPI1.1 participates in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance through its enzymatic activity, which was enhanced significantly by its binding with XA3/XA26. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e, accumulated in the OsTPI1.1-overexpressing plants, and suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> decreased ROS accumulation. The changes in ROS are associated with the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, which may act as a redox cofactor to scavenge ROS, leading to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsTPI1.1 modulates ROS production as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanism against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-regulated, ABA still induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA regulates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment regulate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated regulation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-regulated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA regulates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this regulation partially contributes to ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p>Heat stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that heat shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in heat tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. High ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in barley.</p>

Antibiotic tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance
<p>Controlled experimental evolution during antibiotic treatment can help to explain the processes leading to antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in bacteria. Recently, intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is, the ability to survive under treatment without developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. However, whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Preventing the evolution of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Mp708.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (2°C) below and above their habitat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

We discovered that nanometer-sized grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical grain size. The instability <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rises substantially at smaller grain sizes, and the nanograins remain stable even above the recrystallization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es of coarse grains. The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.</p>

Mapping the malaria parasite druggable genome by using in vitro evolution and chemogenomics
<p>Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene amplifications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition, where gene amplifications contributed to one-third of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition events. Beyond confirming previously identified multidrug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms, we discovered hitherto unrecognized drug target–inhibitor pairs, including thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea. This exploration of the <i>P. falciparum</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ome and druggable genome will likely guide drug discovery and structural biology efforts, while also advancing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms available to the malaria parasite.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e. We isolated the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid metal–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods.

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of methane, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize methane to methanol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es.

More oxygenated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates methane, which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of methane to methanol using molecular oxygen is possible.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target in patients with various cancers. Unfortunately, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to EGFR-targeted therapeutics is common. Previous studies identified two mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Nuclear translocation of EGFR bypasses the inhibitory effects of cetuximab, and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance by maintaining EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that AXL mediated the nuclear translocation of EGFR in the setting of cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Cetuximab-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant clones of non–small cell lung cancer in culture and patient-derived xenografts in mice had increased abundance of AXL and nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Cellular fractionation analysis, super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that genetic loss of AXL reduced the accumulation of nEGFR. SRC family kinases (SFKs) and HER family ligands promote the nuclear translocation of EGFR. We found that AXL knockdown reduced the expression of the genes encoding the SFK family members YES and LYN and the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). AXL knockdown also decreased the interaction between EGFR and the related receptor HER3 and accumulation of HER3 in the nucleus. Overexpression of LYN and NRG1 in cells depleted of AXL resulted in accumulation of nEGFR, rescuing the deficit induced by lack of AXL. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unrecognized role for AXL in regulating the nuclear translocation of EGFR and suggest that AXL-mediated SFK and <i>NRG1</i> expression promote this process.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point.

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

Activation of surface lattice oxygen in single-atom Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> for low-temperature CO oxidation

Achieving low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e activity, while surviving the harsh conditions encountered at high engine loads, remains a formidable challenge.

Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics

A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance after 4000 bending cycles.

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown.

Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in plants.</p>

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis
<sec><title>Amorphous and More Active</title><p>The electrochemical generation of hydrogen from water could help in the storage of energy generated by renewable resources at off-peak times.

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits.

Short-Term Exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide Provides Basal Pathogen Resistance
<p>Nitrogen di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (NO<sub>2</sub>) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological functions. Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO<sub>2</sub> in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) for 1 h with 10 µL L<sup>−1</sup> NO<sub>2.</sub> Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and the hemibiotrophic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>B. cinerea</i>. An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO<sub>2</sub>-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO<sub>2</sub>-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO<sub>2</sub>-triggered <i>B. cinerea</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and <i>CYTOCHROME P450 79B2</i> (<i>CYP79B2</i>), <i>CYP79B3</i>, and <i>PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3</i> gene functions but independent of camalexin, <i>CYP81F2</i>, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO<sub>2</sub> triggers basal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO<sub>2</sub> in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in common waterhemp.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant tomato plants. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase homolog.

HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases are a multigene family of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases (AAO1–AAO4) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In developing seeds, this response is largely controlled by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic control of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely controlled by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is controlled by a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in crops.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic electron transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase (FNR) transfers electrons from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic electron transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on electron transport and super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e production, and perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

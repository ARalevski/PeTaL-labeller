Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a common feature of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e does not recombine with the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution in this lineage.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, as has been widely observed in yeast and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e termed extra circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation provides a rational template to implement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es at the single cell level and/or by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual genes. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pairs. Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es displayed different expression levels compared with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Lysosomal metabolomics reveals V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent regulation of amino acid efflux from lysosomes
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>e degrades and recycles macromolecules, signals to the cytosol and nucleus, and is implicated in many diseases. Here, we describe a method for the rapid isolation of mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>es and use it to quantitatively profile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al metabolites under various cell states. Under nutrient-replete conditions, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al amino acids are in rapid exchange with those in the cytosol. Loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al acidification through inhibition of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) increased the luminal concentrations of most metabolites but had no effect on those of the majority of essential amino acids. Instead, nutrient starvation regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al concentrations of these amino acids, an effect we traced to regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibition of mTOR strongly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al efflux of most essential amino acids, converting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>e into a cellular depot for them. These results reveal the dynamic nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al metabolites and that V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent mechanisms exist for controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al amino acid efflux.</p>

Competing chromosomes explain junk DNA
<p>The vast majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es have two copies of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and reproduce sexually. Meiosis is a vital process that produces gametes (eggs and sperm) by reducing the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copies to one; fertilization between egg and sperm restores the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copy number to two. During female meiosis, one set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es is expelled into a tiny cell called a polar body, whereas the other is segregated into the egg. It is a fundamental tenet of genetics that there is a random, 50% chance for any particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e to be segregated into the egg versus the polar body. However, cases in which one copy of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is inherited with greater than 50% frequency have been reported in many species (<i>1</i>), but the molecular mechanism of this preferential inheritance has remained obscure. Recent work has indicated that centromeres, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions that form attachments to microtubules that mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation during meiosis, compete with each other for inheritance during female meiosis (<i>2</i>). Thus, the essential DNA sequences that mediate accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation are actually “selfish” (or parasitic) genetic elements that have invaded our genome. On page 668 of this issue, Akera <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide the most detailed molecular mechanism to date that explains how a parasitic DNA sequence has used the asymmetry of oocyte meiosis to ensure its own inheritance and therefore its spread through populations.</p>

Specialized Plastids Trigger Tissue-Specific Signaling for Systemic Stress Response in Plants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s comprise a complex set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es in plants that can undergo distinctive patterns of differentiation and redifferentiation during their lifespan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s localized to the epidermis and vascular parenchyma are distinctive in size, structural features, and functions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s are termed “sensory” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, and here we show their proteome to be distinct from chloroplasts, with specialized stress-associated features. The distinctive sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) derives from spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted proteins. Perturbation caused by depletion of the sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-specific protein MutS HOMOLOG1 conditioned local, programmed changes in gene networks controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong>, stress-related phytohormone, and circadian clock behavior and producing a global, systemic stress response in the plant. We posit that the sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> participates in sensing environmental stress, integrating this sensory function with epigenetic and gene expression circuitry to condition heritable stress memory.</p>

Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C4 also induces lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in anaphase but we demonstrated that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e compaction defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in prophase. As a result of C4 action, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s lasts longer and the cell cycle is slowed down.</p><p>We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan aurora kinase as well as with a specific aurora B ATP-competitive inhibitor; we therefore propose that histone H3 phosphorylation and anaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e compaction involve the basal activity of aurora kinase B. Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s entry and at anaphase onset. The full activation of aurora kinase B by its partners, in prometaphase, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of aurora B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of aurora B correspond to different conformations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al complex revealed by FRAP.</p><p>The presence of lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with aurora kinase inhibitors.</p>

ER-mitochondria tethering by PDZD8 regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mammalian neurons

In yeast, the ERMES complex is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> tether composed of four proteins, three of which contain a SMP (synaptotagmin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l-lipid binding protein) domain. No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> contacts. The SMP domain of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP domain found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> contacts in mammalian cells. In neurons, PDZD8 was required for calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> after synaptically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from ER and thereby regulated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Thus, PDZD8 represents a critical ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> tethering protein in metazoans. We suggest that ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> coupling is involved in the regulation of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mammalian neurons.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, suggesting that a defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in ribosome assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein import, the processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNAs, and the assembly of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p>Adults older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es, because knocking down IRF8 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from younger adults was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

A mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway promotes faithful chromosome segregation
<p>The ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is crucial for DNA damage and replication stress responses. Here, we describe an unexpected role of ATR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. Acute inhibition or degradation of ATR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s induces whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e missegregation. The effect of ATR ablation is not due to altered cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity, DNA damage responses, or unscheduled DNA synthesis but to loss of an ATR function at centromeres. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, ATR localizes to centromeres through Aurora A–regulated association with centromere protein F (CENP-F), allowing ATR to engage replication protein A (RPA)–coated centromeric R loops. As ATR is activated at centromeres, it stimulates Aurora B through Chk1, preventing formation of lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Thus, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway acts at centromeres to promote faithful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation, revealing functions of R loops and ATR in suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e instability.</p>

ChromEMT: Visualizing 3D chromatin structure and compaction in interphase and mitotic cells
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> structure of DNA determines genome compaction and activity in the nucleus. On the basis of in vitro structures and electron microscopy (EM) studies, the hierarchical model is that 11-nanometer DNA-nucleosome polymers fold into 30- and subsequently into 120- and 300- to 700-nanometer fibers and mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. To visualize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> in situ, we identified a fluorescent dye that stains DNA with an osmiophilic polymer and selectively enhances its contrast in EM. Using ChromEMT (ChromEM tomography), we reveal the ultrastructure and three-dimensional (3D) organization of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> polymers, megabase domains, and mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> is a disordered 5- to 24-nanometer-diameter curvilinear chain that is packed together at different 3D concentration distributions in interphase and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> chains have many different particle arrangements and bend at various lengths to achieve structural compaction and high packing densities.</p>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prokaryot</span></strong>es and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to heat. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, heat-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of heat-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in heat tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced heat tolerance. Compromised heat tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation under heat stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised heat-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the heat tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein EF-Tu is heat sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant heat stress responses, primarily functioning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear heat-responsive gene expression.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e content, represents a large-effect mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es do not differ from nonhomologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in thousands of single cells
<p>Although we can increasingly measure transcription, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong>, methylation, and other aspects of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y at single-cell resolution, most assays survey only one aspect of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.

As a proof of concept, we apply sci-CAR to 4825 cells, including a time series of dexamethasone treatment, as well as to 11,296 cells from the adult mouse kidney. With the resulting data, we compare the pseudotemporal dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> accessibility and gene expression, reconstruct the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> accessibility profiles of cell types defined by RNA profiles, and link cis-regulatory sites to their target genes on the basis of the covariance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> accessibility and transcription across large numbers of single cells.</p>

A new mitotic activity comes into focus
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, each duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e must be accurately attached to the microtubule spindle, which pulls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es to opposite poles of the cell, where they are segregated to daughter cells. A number of mitotic kinases orchestrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to ensure accurate segregation, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), the Polo-like kinases, and the Aurora kinases (<i>1</i>). The kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), which is involved in DNA damage responses during interphase of the cell cycle, has also been shown to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation errors (<i>2</i>). However, this role of ATR was presumed to be an indirect effect. On page 108 of this issue, Kabeche <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) unveil a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s-specific ATR activity that ensures proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation and that this activity is dependent on a specific three-stranded nucleic acid structure known as an R loop.</p>

Fertile offspring from sterile sex chromosome trisomic mice

Sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e loss is comparatively infrequent during mouse XX and XY iPSC generation.

Actin protects mammalian eggs against chromosome segregation errors
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation is driven by a spindle that is made of microtubules but is generally thought to be independent of actin. Here, we report an unexpected actin-dependent mechanism that drives the accurate alignment and segregation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in mammalian eggs. Prominent actin filaments permeated the microtubule spindle in eggs of several mammalian species, including humans. Disrupting actin in mouse eggs led to significantly increased numbers of misaligned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es as well as lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es during meiosis I and II. We found that actin drives accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation by promoting the formation of functional kinetochore fibers, the microtubule bundles that align and segregate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Thus, actin is essential to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation errors in eggs, which are a leading cause of miscarriages, infertility, and Down syndrome.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> accessibility.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l matrix and that avian flight muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape

Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

Mitotic transcription and waves of gene reactivation during mitotic exit
<p>Although the genome is generally thought to be transcriptionally silent during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, technical limitations have prevented sensitive mapping of transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit. Thus, the means by which the interphase expression pattern is transduced to daughter cells have been unclear. We used 5-ethynyluridine to pulse-label transcripts during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit and found that many genes exhibit transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, as confirmed with fluorescein isothiocyanate–uridine 5′-triphosphate labeling, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The first round of transcription immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s primarily activates genes involved in the growth and rebuilding of daughter cells, rather than cell type–specific functions. We propose that the cell’s transcription pattern is largely retained at a low level through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, whereas the amplitude of transcription observed in interphase is reestablished during mitotic exit.</p>

Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts
<p>The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong>. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, duplicated nucleosome fibers are organized into a pair of rod-shaped structures (chromatids) within a mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e. However, it remains unclear whether nucleosome assembly is indeed an essential prerequisite for mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e assembly. We combined mouse sperm nuclei and <i>Xenopus</i> cell-free egg extracts depleted of the histone chaperone Asf1 and found that chromatid-like structures could be assembled even in the near absence of nucleosomes. The resultant “nucleosome-depleted” chromatids contained discrete central axes positive for condensins, although they were more fragile than normal nucleosome-containing chromatids. Combinatorial depletion experiments underscored the central importance of condensins in mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e assembly, which sheds light on their functional cross-talk with nucleosomes in this process.</p>

Light and Plastid Signals Regulate Different Sets of Genes in the Albino Mutant Pap7-1
<p>Plants possessing dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s due to defects in pigment biosynthesis or translation are known to repress photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes via retrograde signals from the disturbed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es toward the nucleus. These signals are thought to be essential for proper biogenesis and function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Mutants lacking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) display a genetic arrest in eoplast-chloroplast transition leading to an albino phenotype in the light. Retrograde signaling in these mutants, therefore, could be expected to be similar as under conditions inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> dysfunction. To answer this question, we performed plastome- and genomewide array analyses in the <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In parallel, we determined the potential overlap with light-regulated expression networks. To this end, we performed a comparative expression profiling approach using light- and dark-grown wild-type plants as relative control for the expression profiles obtained from light-grown <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants. Our data indicate a specific impact of retrograde signals on metabolism-related genes in <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants reflecting the starvation situation of the albino seedlings. In contrast, light regulation of PhANGs and other nuclear gene groups appears to be fully functional in this mutant, indicating that a block in chloroplast biogenesis per se does not repress expression of them as suggested by earlier studies. Only genes for light harvesting complex proteins displayed a significant repression indicating an exclusive retrograde impact on this gene family. Our results indicate that chloroplasts and arrested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s each emit specific signals that control different target gene modules both in positive and negative manner.</p>

An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>E RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA editing interacting protein/multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>ar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RNA editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genes.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e size. Moreover, their positions are not random on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical structures from silica) occurs in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Gene bivalency at Polycomb domains regulates cranial neural crest positional identity
<p>The cranial neural crest cells are multipotent cells that provide head skeletogenic mesenchyme and are crucial for craniofacial patterning. We analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> landscapes of mouse cranial neural crest subpopulations in vivo. Early postmigratory subpopulations contributing to distinct mouse craniofacial structures displayed similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> accessibility patterns yet differed transcriptionally. Accessible promoters and enhancers of differentially silenced genes carried H3K27me3/H3K4me2 bivalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> marks embedded in large <i>enhancer of zeste homolog 2</i>–dependent Polycomb domains, indicating transcriptional poising. These postmigratory bivalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> regions were already present in premigratory progenitors. At Polycomb domains, H3K27me3 antagonized H3K4me2 deposition, which was restricted to accessible sites. Thus, bivalent Polycomb domains provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> template for the regulation of cranial neural crest cell positional identity in vivo, contributing insights into the epigenetic regulation of face morphogenesis.</p>

Lysosomal cholesterol activates mTORC1 via an SLC38A9–Niemann-Pick C1 signaling complex
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that becomes activated at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>e in response to nutrient cues. Here, we identify cholesterol, an essential building block for cellular growth, as a nutrient input that drives mTORC1 recruitment and activation at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al surface. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al transmembrane protein, SLC38A9, is required for mTORC1 activation by cholesterol through conserved cholesterol-responsive motifs. Moreover, SLC38A9 enables mTORC1 activation by cholesterol independently from its arginine-sensing function. Conversely, the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, which regulates cholesterol export from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>e, binds to SLC38A9 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling through its sterol transport function. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysosom</span></strong>al cholesterol drives mTORC1 activation and growth signaling through the SLC38A9-NPC1 complex.</p>

3D organization of synthetic and scrambled chromosomes
<p>Although the design of the synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 is highly conservative with respect to gene content, the deletion of several classes of repeated sequences and the introduction of thousands of designer changes may affect genome organization and potentially alter cellular functions. We report here the Hi-C–determined three-dimensional (3D) conformations of Sc2.0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. The absence of repeats leads to a smoother contact pattern and more precisely tractable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e conformations, and the large-scale genomic organization is globally unaffected by the presence of synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e(s).

Control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26<i>S</i> proteasome
<p>During meiosis, paired homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (homologs) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossovers. Crossovers mediate homolog segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in homolog juxtaposition and crossing over. Without proteasome function, homologs failed to pair and instead remained associated with nonhomologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Although dispensable for noncrossover formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e axes and stable strand exchange of crossover-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

Distortion of histone octamer core promotes nucleosome mobilization by a chromatin remodeler
<p>Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> remodeling enzymes play essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles by mobilizing nucleosomal DNA. Yet, how DNA is mobilized despite the steric constraints placed by the histone octamer remains unknown. Using methyl transverse relaxation–optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 450-kilodalton complex, we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> remodeler, SNF2h, distorts the histone octamer. Binding of SNF2h in an activated ATP state changes the dynamics of buried histone residues. Preventing octamer distortion by site-specific disulfide linkages inhibits nucleosome sliding by SNF2h while promoting octamer eviction by the SWI-SNF complex, RSC. Our findings indicate that the histone core of a nucleosome is more plastic than previously imagined and that octamer deformation plays different roles based on the type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> remodeler. Octamer plasticity may contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> regulation beyond ATP-dependent remodeling.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prokaryot</span></strong>es in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Our results show that horseradish and watercress genomes originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) genome, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation in watercress, both genomes are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental subgenomes might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress genomes. The subgenome stasis, apart from the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid genomes. The octoploid genome of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress genomes, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cytogenomic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-genome sequencing efforts and genetic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Vacuolar Iron Stores Gated by NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 Are the Primary Source of Iron in Germinating Seeds
<p>During seed germination, iron (Fe) stored in vacuoles is exported by the redundant NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 transporter proteins. A double <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant is unable to mobilize Fe stores and does not develop in the absence of external Fe. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> and wild type during germination and early seedling development. Even though sufficient Fe was supplied, the Fe-responsive transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i>, <i>39</i>, <i>100</i>, and <i>101</i> and their downstream targets <i>FRO2</i> and <i>IRT1</i> mediating Fe uptake were strongly upregulated in the <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant. Activation of the Fe deficiency response was confirmed by increased ferric chelate reductase activity in the mutant. At early stages, genes important for chloroplast redox control (<i>FSD1</i> and <i>SAPX</i>), Fe homeostasis (<i>FER1</i> and <i>SUFB</i>), and chlorophyll metabolism (<i>HEMA1</i> and <i>NYC1</i>) were downregulated, indicating limited Fe availability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. In contrast, expression of <i>FRO3</i>, encoding a ferric reductase involved in Fe import into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>, was maintained, and Fe-dependent enzymes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> were unaffected in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i>. Together, these data show that a failure to mobilize Fe stores during germination triggered Fe deficiency responses and strongly affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein SOT5/EMB2279 Is Required for Plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> Intron Splicing
<p>Chloroplast biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interaction between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> and nuclear genomic products. Using a high-throughput screen for chloroplast biogenesis suppressors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we identified a <i>suppressor of thf1</i> (<i>sot5</i>) that displays virescent and serrated leaves. Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i>. Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two additional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal. SOT5 is predicted to bind to specific RNA sequences found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes, and we found decreased splicing efficiency of the <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes in <i>sot5</i> mutants. Together, our results reveal that the PPR protein SOT5/EMB2279 is required for intron splicing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i>, providing insights into the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation in the coupled development between chloroplasts and leaves.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l tail-anchored proteins.</p>

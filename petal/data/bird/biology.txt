Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis. Identification of individuals at greatest AF risk could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic data can stratify risk for development of AF, we examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical risk factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF risk factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Efforts are warranted to determine whether AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk may improve identification of subclinical AF or help distinguish between stroke mechanisms.</p></sec>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to drug-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging drugs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched QT and plasma drug concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic QT score comprising 61 common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s drug-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus drug concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic QT score was correlated with drug-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% confidence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03). Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic QT score was a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=12%, <i>P</i>=1×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic QT score comprising 61 common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes. These findings highlight an opportunity for recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic discoveries to improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for pharmacological therapies.

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ecolog</span></strong>y. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>es, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>ical traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and environmental conditioning of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y are hindered by the lack of flexible and effective tools for quantifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-homology-based topological methods can improve measurement of variation in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-homology-based methods can more comprehensively capture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>ical variation; (2) these techniques discriminate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and detect a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multivariate traits, whether statistically derived from univariate or persistent-homology-based traits, improve our ability to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis of phenotype; and (4) persistent-homology-based techniques detect unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multivariate derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y are now detectable. The QTL results further imply that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural variation in tomato. Persistent homology is a versatile framework to quantify plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>ical changes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical transitions, and underlying transcriptional programming remain to be elucidated. A systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>ical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall thickening, and programmed cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and growth, hormone synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phytohormones play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of hormones at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of hormones in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>y of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Disparities in science literacy
<p>Much is known about how adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy varies internationally and over time, and about its association with attitudes and beliefs. However, less is known about disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy across racial and ethnic groups (<i>1</i>). This is particularly surprising in light of substantial research on racial and ethnic disparities in related areas such as educational achievement, math and reading ability (<i>2</i>), representation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations (<i>3</i>), and health literacy (<i>4</i>). Given the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy to securing and sustaining many jobs, to understanding key health concepts to enhance quality of life, and to increasing public engagement in societal decision-making (<i>5</i>), it is concerning if the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy is unequally stratified, particularly if this stratification reflects broader patterns of disadvantage and cultural dominance as experienced by minorities and educationally underserved populations. We describe here such disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy in the United States and attempt to explain underlying drivers, concluding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy disadvantage among black and Hispanic adults relative to whites is only partially explained by measures of broader, foundational literacies and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

An Anthropocene map of genetic diversity
<p>The Anthropocene is witnessing a loss of biodiversity, with well-documented declines in the diversity of ecosystems and species. For intraspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity, however, we lack even basic knowledge on its global distribution. We georeferenced 92,801 mitochondrial sequences for >4500 species of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity is 27% higher in the tropics than in nontropical regions. Overall, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s that are more affected by humans hold less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity than wilder regions, although results for mammals are sensitive to choice of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic locus. Our study associates geographic coordinates with publicly available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic sequences at a massive scale, yielding an opportunity to investigate both the drivers of this component of biodiversity and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic consequences of the anthropogenic modification of nature.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>ical traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Genetics, Lifestyle, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young and Apparently Healthy Women

We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting

However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk.

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> to enhance its water management.</p>

Multifaceted Activities of Type I Interferon Are Revealed by a Receptor Antagonist

Single-cell bioluminescence imaging of deep tissue in freely moving animals
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ence is a natural light source based on luciferase catalysis of its substrate luciferin. We performed directed evolution on firefly luciferase using a red-shifted and highly deliverable luciferin analog to establish AkaBLI, an all-engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ence in vivo imaging system. AkaBLI produced emissions in vivo that were brighter by a factor of 100 to 1000 than conventional systems, allowing noninvasive visualization of single cells deep inside freely moving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Single tumorigenic cells trapped in the mouse lung vasculature could be visualized. In the mouse brain, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic labeling with neural activity sensors allowed tracking of small clusters of hippocampal neurons activated by novel environments. In a marmoset, we recorded video-rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ence from neurons in the striatum, a deep brain area, for more than 1 year. AkaBLI is therefore a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioengin</span></strong>eered light source to spur unprecedented scientific, medical, and industrial applications.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant growth and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phytohormones, especially in the regulation of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA promotes the accumulation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the regulation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, <i>ABI4</i> is transcriptionally repressed by EIN3 in ethylene-regulated AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Via transcriptome analysis and molecular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic experiments, we identified <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i>as the direct target of ABI4 in the regulation of AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation. Thus, the EIN3-ABI4- <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i> transcriptional cascade involves a mechanism by which ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation in response to complex environmental stimuli.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ecolog</span></strong>y and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> allocation to xylem. We measured leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>, hydraulic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>cal properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation resolution counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes resolution, inhibition of ERK activation delayed resolution, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation resolution in settings where defective resolution promotes disease progression.</p>

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic drivers for certain cancer types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of cancers. One of the most important observations from this work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic alterations in bona fide cancer drivers (those genes that, when mutated, promote tumorigenesis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver genes appear only in cancers derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of cancer drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums. Here, we discuss the concept of tissue specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic alterations in cancer and provide general hypotheses to help explain this biological phenomenon.</p>

The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al tests for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al testing.</p>

Pleistocene North African genomes link Near Eastern and sub-Saharan African human populations
<p>North Africa is a key region for understanding human history, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic history of its people is largely unknown. We present genomic data from seven 15,000-year-old modern humans, attributed to the Iberomaurusian culture, from Morocco. We find a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic affinity with early Holocene Near Easterners, best represented by Levantine Natufians, suggesting a pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al connection between Africa and the Near East. We do not find evidence for gene flow from Paleolithic Europeans to Late Pleistocene North Africans. The Taforalt individuals derive one-third of their ancestry from sub-Saharan Africans, best approximated by a mixture of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic components preserved in present-day West and East Africans. Thus, we provide direct evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions between modern humans across Africa and Eurasia in the Pleistocene.</p>

Moving in the Anthropocene: Global reductions in terrestrial mammalian movements
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ecolog</span></strong>ical trait of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.</p>

Changes in the microbiota cause genetically modified <i>Anopheles</i> to spread in a population
<p>The mosquito’s innate immune system controls both <i>Plasmodium</i> and bacterial infections. We investigated the competitiveness of mosquitoes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically modified to alter expression of their own anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> immune genes in a mixed-cage population with wild-type mosquitoes. We observed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically modified mosquitoes with increased immune activity in the midgut tissue did not have an observed fitness disadvantage and showed reduced microbial loads in both the midgut and reproductive organs. These changes result in a mating preference of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically modified males for wild-type females, whereas wild-type males prefer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically modified females.

Mass seasonal bioflows of high-flying insect migrants
<p>Migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als have an impact on ecosystems directly via influxes of predators, prey, and competitors and indirectly by vectoring nutrients, energy, and pathogens. Although linkages between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the effects of mass insect “bioflows” have not been described. We quantified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying (>150 meters) insects and show that ~3.5 trillion insects (3200 tons of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>) migrate above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in insects larger than 10 milligrams, which exploit seasonally beneficial tailwinds.

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biotechnolog</span></strong>ically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics, developmental biology, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biotechnolog</span></strong>y. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cell ablation.</p>

A Methyltransferase Trio Essential for Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis and Growth
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a primary class of membrane lipids in most eukaryotes. In plants, the primary PC biosynthetic pathway and its role in plant growth and development remain elusive due to lack of a mutant model with substantially decreased PC content. Recently, a double mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PHOSPHO-BASE <i>N</i>-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (PMT1) and PMT3 was reported with reduced PC content and defective plant growth. However, residual PC content as well as the nonlethal phenotype of the mutant suggests an additional enzyme contributes to PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In this article, we report on the role of three PMTs in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant development, with a focus on PMT2. <i>PMT2</i> had the highest expression level among the three PMTs, and it was highly expressed in roots. The <i>pmt1 pmt2</i> double mutant enhanced the defects in root growth, cell viability, and PC content of <i>pmt1</i>, suggesting that PMT2 functions together with PMT1 in roots. Chemical inhibition of PMT activity in wild-type roots reproduced the short root phenotype observed in <i>pmt1 pmt2</i>, suggesting that PMT1 and PMT2 are the major PMT isoforms in roots. In shoots, <i>pmt1 pmt2 pmt3</i> enhanced the phenotype of <i>pmt1 pmt3</i>, showing seedling lethality and further reduced PC content without detectable de novo PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. These results suggest that PMTs catalyze an essential reaction step in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and that the three PMTs have differential tissue-specific functions in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant growth.</p>

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in temperate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in cotton.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>ical and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al sustainability. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit coloration is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit coloration as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s regulation.

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We identified five CT-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci related to CT have been identified. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was identified as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci identified here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated gene expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological development to optimize plant growth and development in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically promoted floral development. Our results also demonstrated the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex development and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem development as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased gene expression on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cascades and gene interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological development and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from virus-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of virus-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous virus-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the virus-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters.

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>ated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>ical features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morpholog</span></strong>y closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We recently identified 156 proteins in human plasma that were each associated with the net Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score using an aptamer-based proteomic platform in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma protein-level variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic determinants of proteins associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology.

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/polarization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage polarization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like polarization even under M1-like polarizing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage polarization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like polarization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

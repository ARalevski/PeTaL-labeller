Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction and residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was externally validated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in patients with 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <10%. These data suggest that even with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al treatment, many patients with vascular disease will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Genetic Predisposition, Clinical Risk Factor Burden, and Lifetime Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term probability of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) considering genetic predisposition and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF in individuals from the community-based Framingham Heart Study. Polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for AF was derived using a score of ≈1000 AF-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden was calculated for each individual using a validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score for incident AF comprised of height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking status, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of heart failure. We estimated the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF within tertiles of polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 4606 participants without AF at 55 years of age, 580 developed incident AF (median follow-up, 9.4 years; 25th–75th percentile, 4.4–14.3 years). The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF >55 years of age was 37.1% and was substantially influenced by both polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden. Among individuals free of AF at 55 years of age, those in low-polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> tertiles had a lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF of 22.3% (95% confidence interval, 15.4−9.1), whereas those in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> tertiles had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of 48.2% (95% confidence interval, 41.3−55.1).

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction among a subgroup at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score derived from up to 57 common DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (top quintile of polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, statin therapy was associated with a relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction with statin therapy was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0–5.1) among those in the high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> group and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was associated with 1.32-fold (95% CI, 1.04–1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7% higher (95% CI, 2.2–17.8) burden of carotid plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to prevent a first coronary heart disease event.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model), with no difference in ICH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier, rather than an overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of stroke, we calculated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> component modifies and accentuates stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.</p></sec>

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> varies by cancer type, decade of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck tumors (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ estimates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011.

However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-estimated stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in estimating stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when estimating bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, assessed by either empirical model or physician estimates.

Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis after simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of two agents,   aspirin and warfarin, for the prevention of venous thromboembolism   (VTE) after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>taneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA),   and to elucidate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE conferred by this procedure compared   with unilateral TKA (UTKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted on 18   951 patients, 3685 who underwent SBTKA and 15 266 who underwent   UTKA, using aspirin or warfarin as VTE prophylaxis. Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Statistical   analyses were performed with logistic regression accounting for   baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The adjusted incidence of PE following SBTKA was 1.0% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.2) with aspirin and 2.2% (95% CI 2.0 to   2.4) with warfarin. Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin. In addition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>   of PE was 204% higher for patients undergoing SBTKA relative to   those undergoing UTKA. For each ten-point increase in baseline VTE   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE increased by 25.5% for patients undergoing   SBTKA compared with 10.5% for those undergoing UTKA. Patients with   a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease had   the greatest increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> from undergoing SBTKA instead of UTKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Aspirin is more effective than warfarin for the prevention of   VTE following SBTKA, and serves as the more appropriate agent for   VTE prophylaxis for patients in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> categories.

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FIN<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely associated with incident AF with a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90 versus 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.023). No sex differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men. About 20% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was observed for body mass index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF was high, and AF was strongly associated with increased mortality both in women and men. Body mass index explained the largest proportion of AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Observed sex differences in the association of body mass index and total cholesterol with AF need to be evaluated for underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ophysiology and relevance to sex-specific prevention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Predicting Cardiovascular Events in Familial Hypercholesterolemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have been described, models for predicting incident ASCVD have not been reported. Our aim was to use the SAFEHEART registry (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cohort Study) to define key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors for predicting incident ASCVD in patients with FH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SAFEHEART is a multicenter, nationwide, long-term prospective cohort study of a molecularly defined population with FH with or without previous ASCVD. Analyses to define <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors and to build a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction equation were developed, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction equation was tested for its ability to discriminate patients who experience incident ASCVD from those who did not over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We recruited 2404 adult patients with FH who were followed up for a mean of 5.5 years (SD, 3.2 years), during which 12 (0.5%) and 122 (5.1%) suffered fatal and nonfatal incident ASCVD, respectively. Age, male sex, history of previous ASCVD, high blood pressure, increased body mass index, active smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels were independent predictors of incident ASCVD from which a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation with a Harrell C index of 0.85 was derived. The bootstrap resampling (100 randomized samples) of the original set for internal validation showed a degree of over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ism of 0.003. Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was estimated for each person without an established diagnosis of ASCVD before enrollment in the registry by use of the SAFEHEART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation, the modified Framingham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD Pooled Cohort <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Equations. The Harrell C index for these models was 0.81, 0.78, and 0.8, respectively, and differences between the SAFEHEART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation and the other 2 were significant (<i>P</i>=0.023 and <i>P</i>=0.045).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident ASCVD may be estimated in patients with FH with simple clinical predictors.

Range of Risk Factor Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular complications, but it is unknown to what extent fulfilling all cardiovascular treatment goals is associated with residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in those with T1DM compared with the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all patients ≥18 years of age with T1DM who were registered in the Swedish National Diabetes Register from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2014, a total of 33 333 patients, each matched for age and sex with 5 controls without diabetes mellitus randomly selected from the population. Patients with T1DM were categorized according to number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors not at target: glycohemoglobin, blood pressure, albuminuria, smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, and stroke was examined in relation to the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors at target.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean follow-up was 10.4 years in the diabetes group.

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial genetic basis. Identification of individuals at greatest AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether genetic data can stratify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for development of AF, we examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses.

Association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We investigated whether HIV infection is associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in a large cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically similar HIV-uninfected veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014. We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events after adjusting for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral load, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events. Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After adjustment for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13).

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model based solely on nonlaboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors plus lipids for predicting high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood.

Population-Based Long-Term Cardiac-Specific Mortality Among 34 489 Five-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer in Great Britain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of cardiac morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously. However, little is known about the very long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of cardiac mortality and whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> has decreased among those more recently diagnosed. We investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of long-term cardiac mortality among survivors within the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac mortality. Standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were used to quantify cardiac mortality excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>taneous effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 181 cardiac deaths were observed, which was 3.4 times that expected. Survivors were 2.5 times and 5.9 times more at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>y/heart failure death, respectively, than expected. Among those >60 years of age, subsequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, providing clear focus for preventive interventions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of both overall cardiac and cardiomyo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>y/heart failure mortality was greatest among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989.

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new criteria for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous Australian children using these criteria and to compare the findings with a group of Australian children at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was performed on high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous children aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia. A comparison group of low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, non-Indigenous children living in urban centers was also screened. Echocardiograms were reported in a standardized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, 34 met World Heart Federation criteria for definite RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, none met the criteria for definite RHD, and 5 met the criteria for borderline RHD. High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children were more likely to have definite or borderline RHD than low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 2.3–14.1]; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The prevalence of definite RHD in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous Australian children approximates what we expected in our population, and no definite RHD was identified in the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> group. This study suggests that definite RHD, as defined by the World Heart Federation criteria, is likely to represent true disease.

Systematic Biology
Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the pelvis are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of pelvic chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model, our objective   was to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors for the development of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the pelvis were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 years (one week to 23.1 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died. Overall survival was 76%, 55% and 45% at one, five and   ten years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, respectively. In a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model   the cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of the development of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one year, post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic reconstruction was a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor for   the development of complications (p = 0.006). Complications were   not significantly related to age or the location or grade of the   tumour (p = 0.823, p = 0.976, p = 0.858).

Transplant-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. In patients with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS. Early S2P did not rescue patients with greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burdens. Instead, referral for heart transplantation may offer their best chance at long-term survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Revised Framingham Stroke Risk Profile to Reflect Temporal Trends
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Age-adjusted stroke incidence has decreased over the past 50 years, likely as a result of changes in the prevalence and impact of various stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.

Importance of Assessing Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Clinical Practice: A Case for Fitness as a Clinical Vital Sign: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>Mounting evidence has firmly established that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates attributable to various cancers. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence demonstrates not only that CRF is a potentially stronger predictor of mortality than established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but that the addition of CRF to traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors significantly improves the reclassification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this statement is to review current knowledge related to the association between CRF and health outcomes, increase awareness of the added value of CRF to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction, and suggest future directions in research. Although the statement is not intended to be a comprehensive review, critical references that address important advances in the field are highlighted. The underlying premise of this statement is that the addition of CRF for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> classification presents health professionals with unique opportunities to improve patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement and to encourage lifestyle-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es designed to reduce cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. These opportunities must be realized to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ize the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and hence meet the American Heart Association’s 2020 goals.</p>

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-tapered   cementless femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   identified.

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative mortality compared   with cementless THA.

Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent cemented THA had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of   death during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of mortality was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of death than controls. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that cementation of the   femoral component was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a cemented acetabular component combined with a cementless   femoral component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving cemented THA have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minima</span></strong>lly increased relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>   of early mortality that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at baseline if they had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization.

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>ways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib.

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minima</span></strong>l length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>s through the maze, most solutions are sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> while opening a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minima</span></strong>l length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong>s through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">path</span></strong> but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of   intravenous tranexamic acid on the reduction of blood loss, transfusion   rate, and early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative clinical outcome in total shoulder   arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A randomised, placebo-controlled trial which included 54 patients   undergoing unilateral primary stemless anatomical or stemmed reverse   total shoulder arthroplasty was undertaken. Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure. Peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood loss   via an intra-articular drain was recorded and total blood loss was   calculated. The post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative transfusion rate was documented.   Assessment of early clinical parameters included the visual analogue   scale for pain (VAS), documentation of haematoma formation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood drainage (placebo: 170 ml <i>versus</i> TXA:   50 ml, p = 0.001) and calculated mean total blood loss (placebo:   1248.2 ml <i>versus</i> TXA: 871.0 ml, p = 0.009) were   significantly lower in the TXA group. No transfusions were necessary   during the study period in either group. Mean VAS for pain significantly   decreased from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (VAS 7) to the early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   period (VAS 1.7, p < 0.001). Significant differences regarding   mean post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative pain between placebo (VAS 2.0) and TXA (VAS   1.3) were detected (p = 0.05). The occurrence of haematomas was   significantly more frequent in the placebo (59.3%, n = 16) than   in the TXA group (25.9%, n = 6, p = 0.027).

Cardiac disease and advanced age increase the mortality risk following surgery for periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic fracture is a significant complication of total   hip and knee arthroplasty.

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Spinopelvic mobility and acetabular component position for total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Posterior tilt of the pelvis with sitting provides biological   acetabular opening. Our goal was to study the post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative interaction   of skeletal mobility and sagittal acetabular component position.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a radiographic study of 160 hips (151 patients) who   prospectively had lateral spinopelvic hip radiographs for skeletal   and implant measurements. Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative acetabular component position   was determined according to the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative spinal mobility.

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery. Outcomes included the rate of complications   and    re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, PROMS and patient-reported satisfaction at six months   and two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across values for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.6% and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata. In adjusted analyses of the association between LDL-C and hsCRP levels and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, both LDL-C and hsCRP were independently associated with the primary outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001 for each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>LDL-C reduction with evolocumab reduces cardiovascular events across hsCRP strata with greater absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions in patients with higher-baseline hsCRP.

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> standardization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-standardization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified. The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> adjustment model included procedure-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> category, number of hemodynamic vulnerability indicators, renal insufficiency, single-ventricle physiology, and coagulation disorder.

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ize patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement, there is a great need to accurately identify high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> patients. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart failure, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart failure (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was analyzed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart failure was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) identified those patients at highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> marker model in patients with ACHD and can reliably exclude the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of death and heart failure. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify patients at highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular events. These biomarkers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of patients with ACHD.</p></sec>

The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac death. We calculated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> estimates for main outcomes according to a fixed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiac death was similar between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our meta-analysis of randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years demonstrated a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ST and of TLF in patients treated with BVS compared with EES. Of note, BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of TLF and TLR was higher between 1 and 2 years.</p></sec>

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es for cardiovascular disease (CVD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each test result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other test results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 tests were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal tests, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (hazard ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (hazard ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6). Findings replicated in the Dallas Health Study were similar for the ASCVD outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among adults without known CVD, a novel multimodality testing strategy using left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly improved global CVD and ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment.</p></sec>

Glycerophosphocholine Metabolites and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Adolescents
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) metabolites modulate atherosclerosis and thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preclinical CVD may start during adolescence. Here, we used targeted serum lipidomics to identify a new panel of GPCs, and tested whether any of these GPCs are associated, in adolescence, with classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors of CVD, namely excess visceral fat (VF), elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a population-based sample of 990 adolescents (12–18 years, 48% male), as part of the Saguenay Youth Study. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified 69 serum GPCs within the 450 to 680 <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> range. We measured VF with MRI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified several novel GPCs that were associated with multiple CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. Most significantly, PC16:0/2:0 was negatively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–19</sup>), blood pressure (<i>P</i>=7.7×10<sup>–5</sup>), and fasting triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=9.0×10<sup>–5</sup>), and PC14:1/0:0 was positively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=3.0×10<sup>–7</sup>), fasting insulin (<i>P</i>=5.4×10<sup>–32</sup>), and triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–29</sup>). The Sobel test of mediation revealed that both GPCs mediated their respective relations between VF (as a potential primary exposure) and CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors (as outcomes, <i>P</i> values<1.3×10<sup>–3</sup>). Furthermore, a GPC shown recently to predict incident coronary heart disease in older adults, PC18:2/0:0, was associated with several CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescents; these associations were less strong than those with the newly identified GPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified novel GPCs strongly associated with multiple CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescents. These GPCs may be sensitive indicators of obesity-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for CVD outcomes in adults, and may improve biological understanding of CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

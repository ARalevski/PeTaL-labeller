Impact of Novel Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol Assessment on the Utility of Secondary Non-High-Density Lipoprotein-C and Apolipoprotein B Targets in Selected Worldwide Dyslipidemia Guidelines
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Selected dyslipidemia guidelines recommend non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) as secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s to the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). After considering 2 LDL-C estimates that differ in accuracy, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed: (1) how frequently non-HDL-C guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s could change management; and (2) the utility of apoB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s after meeting LDL-C and non-HDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed 2518 adults representative of the US population from the 2011 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ation Survey and 126 092 patients from the Very Large Database of Lipids study with apoB. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all individuals as well as those with high-risk clinical features, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome who met very high- and high-risk guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL using Friedewald estimation (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) and a novel, more accurate method (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>). Next, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed those not meeting non-HDL-C (<100, <130 mg/dL) and apoB (<80, <100 mg/dL) guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s. In those meeting dual LDL-C and non-HDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s (<70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively, or <100 and <130 mg/dL, respectively), we determined the proportion of individuals who did not meet guideline apoB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s (<80 or <100 mg/dL).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7% to 9% and 31% to 36% of individuals had LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively.

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explor</span></strong>e the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular diseases. Furthermore, normal and diseased human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>er genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a novel miR-22 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> group (n=98).

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was functionally analyzed in human endothelial cells in vitro. Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity. Selected miRs were modulated in combination with GATA2 to identify signaling pathways at the angiogenic cytokine level via proteome profiler and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Downstream miR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed via bioinformatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> prediction and luciferase reporter gene assays.

Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology.

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian brain contains diverse neuronal types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong> that distinguishes cell types and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>s regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex.

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described.

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient tool for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genome editing. In this study, we showed successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genomic sequence on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genomic sequences without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> any sequence adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing sequences were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible tool for genome editing in medaka.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p>Neurons modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate systemic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during neuronal development, but few other nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of S-nitrosylation have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical neurons and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any system, and 555 are previously un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of S-nitrosylation in neurons. The sites of S-nitrosylation were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed for 59% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical neurons in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in neurons and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of NO signaling.</p>

Unbiased detection of CRISPR off-targets in vivo using DISCOVER-Seq
<p>CRISPR-Cas genome editing induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed DNA damage but can also affect off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sites. Current off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> discovery methods work using purified DNA or specific cellular models but are incapable of direct detection in vivo. We developed DISCOVER-Seq (discovery of in situ Cas off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s and verification by sequencing), a universally applicable approach for unbiased off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation that leverages the recruitment of DNA repair factors in cells and organisms.

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement alters the motion of an object being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. This quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal motion of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e.

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as novel mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling.

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>ers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>ers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as an independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>er correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surveil</span></strong>lance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p>Mutational processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value.

We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing.

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>able capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hall<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>s of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing and signaling. Seedling roots can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>or in the hypocotyl.</p>

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit
<p>Knowledge of the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the RNA level is limited.

A close population relationship and similar nucleotide diversity was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed between the wild and landrace groups, whereas the improved group had substantially reduced nucleotide diversity.

The expression diversity of selected genes exhibited a 20.89% reduction from the wild group to the landrace group, but a 23.13% recovery was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed from the landrace to the improved group, showing a distinctly different pattern with variation of sequence diversity. Module-trait association analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 16 distinct coexpression modules, six of which were highly associated with important fruit traits. The candidate trait-linked differentially expressed genes associated with stone cell formation, fruit size, and sugar content were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in the selected regions, and many of these could also be mapped to the previously reported quantitative trait loci.

Antagonistic Actions of FPA and IBM2 Regulate Transcript Processing from Genes Containing Heterochromatin
<p>Repressive epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>s, such as DNA and histone methylation, are sometimes located within introns. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION2 (IBM2), an RNA-binding protein containing a bromo-adjacent homology domain, is required to process functional transcript isoforms of genes carrying intronic heterochromatin. In a genetic screen for suppressors of the <i>ibm2</i> mutation, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed FPA, an RNA-binding protein that promotes use of proximal polyadenylation sites in genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed by IBM2, including <i>IBM1</i> encoding an essential H3K9 histone demethylase and the disease resistance gene <i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA7</i>. Both IBM2 and FPA are involved in the processing of their common mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s: Transcription of IBM2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes is restored when <i>FPA</i> is mutated in <i>ibm2</i> and impaired in transgenic plants overexpressing <i>FPA</i>.

The DNA methylation patterns of some genes and transposons are modified in <i>fpa</i> plants, including the large intron of <i>IBM1</i>, but these changes are rather limited and reversed when the mutant is complemented, indicating that FPA has a restricted role in mediating silencing.

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in different environments, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed oleosin motifs for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing peptide, are necessary for oleosin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>er–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>er <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surveil</span></strong>lance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>er. From these, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Functional metabolomics aims to translate metabolomics-derived bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>ers to disease mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cohort of 2324 patients who underwent coronary angiography from 4 independent centers was studied.

Significant differential metabolites were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by cross-comparisons with and within CAD types, including normal coronary artery, nonobstructvie coronary atherosclerosis, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction.

The increased level of Neu5Ac in plasma was confirmed by accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed quantification. Mechanistically, Neu5Ac was able to trigger myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase signaling pathway through binding to RhoA and Cdc42, but not Rac1. Silencing neuraminidase-1, the enzyme that regulates Neu5Ac generation, ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced injury in cardiomyocytes and ligation/isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia injury in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of neuraminidase by anti-influenza drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, also protected cardiomyocytes and the heart from myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Functional metabolomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a key role for Neu5Ac in acute myocardial infarction, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing neuraminidase-1 may represent an unrecognized therapeutic intervention for CAD.</p></sec>

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> mismatch as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was analyzed to assess whether patients met the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch ratio >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL).

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database.

Glycerophosphocholine Metabolites and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Adolescents

Here, we used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed serum lipidomics to identify a new panel of GPCs, and tested whether any of these GPCs are associated, in adolescence, with classical risk factors of CVD, namely excess visceral fat (VF), elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a population-based sample of 990 adolescents (12–18 years, 48% male), as part of the Saguenay Youth Study.

Control of Cognate Sense mRNA Translation by cis-Natural Antisense RNAs
<p>Cis-Natural Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding genes and are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, constitute an important group of noncoding RNAs. Whereas several examples of cis-NATs regulating the expression of their cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e gene are known, most cis-NATs function by altering the steady-state level or structure of mRNA via changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or splicing, and very few cases involve the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation. This study was designed to systematically search for cis-NATs influencing cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Establishment of a pipeline relying on sequencing of total polyA<sup>+</sup> and polysomal RNA from Arabidopsis grown under various conditions (i.e. nutrient deprivation and phytohormone treatments) allowed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of 14 cis-NATs whose expression correlated either positively or negatively with cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation. With use of a combination of cis-NAT stable over-expression in transgenic plants and transient expression in protoplasts, the impact of cis-NAT expression on mRNA translation was confirmed for 4 out of 5 tested cis-NAT:<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA pairs. These results expand the number of cis-NATs known to regulate cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation and provide a foundation for future studies of their mode of action. Moreover, this study highlights the role of this class of noncoding RNAs in translation regulation.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for most resurrection plants. Together, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>e enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>e and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>edly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of acquired immunity.

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ation of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>ed alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>er flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

Epigenetic Dysregulation of the Dynamin-Related Protein 1 Binding Partners MiD49 and MiD51 Increases Mitotic Mitochondrial Fission and Promotes Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mitotic fission is increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant disease. The fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) must complex with adaptor proteins to cause fission. Drp1-induced fission has been therapeutically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed in experimental PAH. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e the role of 2 recently discovered, poorly understood Drp1 adapter proteins, mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51), in normal vascular cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explor</span></strong>e their dysregulation in PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Immunoblots of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (control, n=6; PAH, n=8) and immunohistochemistry of lung sections (control, n=6; PAH, n=6) were used to assess the expression of MiD49 and MiD51. The effects of manipulating MiDs on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were assessed in human and rodent PAH pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with flow cytometry. Mitochondrial fission was studied by confocal imaging. A microRNA (miR) involved in the regulation of MiD expression was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed using microarray techniques and in silico analyses. The expression of circulatory miR was assessed with quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in healthy volunteers (HVs) versus patients with PAH from Sheffield, UK (plasma: HV, n=29, PAH, n=27; whole blood: HV, n=11, PAH, n=14) and then confirmed in a cohort from Beijing, China (plasma: HV, n=19, PAH, n=36; whole blood: HV, n=20, PAH, n=39). This work was replicated in monocrotaline and Sugen 5416-hypoxia, preclinical PAH models. Small interfering RNAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing MiDs or an miR mimic were nebulized to rats with monocrotaline-induced PAH (n=4–10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MiD expression is increased in PAH pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, which accelerates Drp1-mediated mitotic fission, increases cell proliferation, and decreases apoptosis. Silencing MiDs (but not other Drp1 binding partners, fission 1 or mitochondrial fission factor) promotes mitochondrial fusion and causes G1-phase cell cycle arrest through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2– and cyclin-dependent kinase 4–dependent mechanisms. Augmenting MiDs in normal cells causes fission and recapitulates the PAH phenotype. MiD upregulation results from decreased miR-34a-3p expression. Circulatory miR-34a-3p expression is decreased in both patients with PAH and preclinical models of PAH. Silencing MiDs or augmenting miR-34a-3p regresses experimental PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In health, MiDs regulate Drp1-mediated fission, whereas in disease, epigenetic upregulation of MiDs increases mitotic fission, which drives pathological proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The miR-34a-3p-MiD pathway offers new therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s for PAH.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury

All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explor</span></strong>e competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively.

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>ers was investigated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an increase in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>er, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>ers through Akt2/mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and increased atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Low systolic blood pressure (SBP) values are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, giving rise to the so-called J-curve phenomenon. We assessed the association between on-treatment SBP levels, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to different SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from 2 large randomized trials that randomly allocated hypertensive patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease to intensive (SBP<120 mm Hg) or conventional (SBP<140 mm Hg) treatment were pooled and harmonized for outcomes and follow-up duration. Using natural cubic splines, we plotted the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events against the mean on-treatment SBP per treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The pooled data consisted of 194 875 on-treatment SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in 13 946 patients (98.9%). During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For both blood pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>. Patients in the lowest SBP stratum were older, had a higher body mass index, smoked more often, and had a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low on-treatment SBP levels are associated with increased cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This association is independent of the attained blood pressure level because the J curve aligns with the SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>. Our results suggest that the benefit or risk associated with intensive blood pressure–lowering treatment can be established only via randomized clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. A particularly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> at the table and in home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sodium added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preparation (5.6%) and salt added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> at the table (4.9%).

Processed foods and food reward

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Evolution of Digestive Enzymes and RNASE1 Provides Insights into Dietary Switch of Cetaceans
<p>Although cetaceans (whales, porpoises, and dolphins) have multi-chambered stomachs, feeding habits of modern cetaceans have dramatically changed from herbivorous to carnivorous. However, the genetic basis underlying this dietary switch remains unexplored. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive enzymes genes (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>CTRC</i>, <i>LIPC</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, <i>PNLIP</i>, <i>PGC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, <i>SI</i>, <i>SLC5A1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) of representative cetaceans, and the evolutionary trajectory of <i>RNASE1</i> in cetartiodactylans. Positive selections were detected with proteinases (i.e., <i>CTRC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) and lipases (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, and <i>PNLIP</i>) suggesting that cetaceans have evolved an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ion capacity for proteins and lipids, the major nutritional components of their prey (fishes and invertebrates). In addition, it was found that <i>RNASE1</i> gene duplicated after the cetartiodactylan speciation and two independent gene duplication events took place in Camelidae and Ruminantia. Positive selection was detected with <i>RNASE1</i> of Camelidae and Bovidae, suggesting enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive efficiency in the ruminants. Remarkably, even though the ancestors of cetaceans were terrestrial artiodactyls that are herbivorous, modern cetaceans lost the pancreatic <i>RNASE1</i> copy with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive function, which is in accordance with the dietary change from herbivorous to carnivorous. In sum, this is the first study that provides new insights into the evolutionary mechanism of dietary switch in cetaceans.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> system.</p>

RNA localization feeds translation
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive tract has to cope with the challenge of functioning efficiently despite irregular cycles of eating and fasting. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ion and absorption of nutrients require large quantities of proteins, mainly enzymes and transporters (<i>1</i>). Although these proteins must be available in the epithelial cells that line the stomach and intestines within minutes upon feeding, their continuous production would impose high upkeep costs on the fasting organism. On page 1299 of this issue, Moor <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify a mechanism that may account for the responsiveness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive system: The monolayer of enterocytes (which form the intestinal epithelium) controls protein expression at the level of translation, through regulated RNA localization.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their axonal projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA neuron ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate neurons reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA neurons.</p>

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger
<p>Free-living animals must not only regulate the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> they consume but also choose which types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> to ingest. The shifting of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference driven by nutrient-specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We identified a dopamine circuit that encodes protein-specific hunger in <i>Drosophila</i>. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this circuit simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein consumption. These studies reveal a crucial circuit mechanism by which animals adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Editing of an Alpha-Kafirin Gene Family Increases, Digestibility and Protein Quality in Sorghum
<p>Kafirins are the major storage proteins in sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) grains and form protein bodies with poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility. Since kafirins are devoid of the essential amino acid lysine, they also impart poor protein quality to the kernel. The α-kafirins, which make up most of the total kafirins, are largely encoded by the <i>k1C</i> family of highly similar genes. We used a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing approach to target the <i>k1C</i> genes to create variants with reduced kafirin levels and improved protein quality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility. A single guide RNA was designed to introduce mutations in a conserved region encoding the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide of α-kafirins. Sequencing of kafirin PCR products revealed extensive edits in 25 of 26 events in one or multiple <i>k1C</i> family members. T1 and T2 seeds showed reduced α-kafirin levels, and selected T2 events showed significantly increased grain protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility and lysine content. Thus, a single consensus single guide RNA carrying target sequence mismatches is sufficient for extensive editing of all <i>k1C</i> genes. The resulting quality improvements can be deployed rapidly for breeding and the generation of transgene-free, improved cultivars of sorghum, a major crop worldwide.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Cascading impacts of large-carnivore extirpation in an African ecosystem
<p>Populations of the world’s largest carnivores are declining and now occupy mere fractions of their historical ranges. Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less fearful, occupy new habitats, and modify those habitats by eating new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-mammal systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, forest-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (<i>Tragelaphus sylvaticus</i>)] expanded into treeless floodplains, where they consumed novel diets and suppressed a common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plant [waterwort (<i>Bergia mossambicensis</i>)]. By experimentally simulating predation risk, we demonstrate that this behavior was reversible. Thus, whereas anthropogenic predator extinction disrupted a trophic cascade by enabling rapid differentiation of prey behavior, carnivore restoration may just as rapidly reestablish that cascade.</p>

But on 2 April, after months of protests from animal welfare activists, USDA declared that the 37-year-old program had "reached its maturity" and "achieved" its goals. The Washington, D.C., advocacy group White Coat Waste Project had protested the lab's killing of dozens of cats each year. It used kittens to collect from their feces a form of the parasite that is needed for research and that is only produced in cats.

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or contaminating other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>s can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG antibodies have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant antibodies, identified the peanut allergen–specific antibodies, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated antibodies could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Wheat—the cereal abandoned by GM
<p>The sudden appearance of crop diseases can cause an irreparable economic shock, particularly to smallholder farmers in developing countries.

It is currently controlled by quarantine but could easily spread to other wheat-growing areas, which could threaten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security. Furthermore, widespread crop failure from stem rust has occurred in Kenya and Ethiopia. Recent advances could provide a solution to this problem through the rapid discovery and isolation of disease-resistance genes from wild relatives of wheat, followed by their introduction by transformation into the elite crop varieties. There is, however, a barrier to such progress: Wheat, a worldwide staple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>, has become an orphan among genetically modified (GM) crops.</p>

Development of Decreased-Gluten Wheat Enabled by Determination of the Genetic Basis of <i>lys3a</i> Barley
<p>Celiac disease is the most common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>-induced enteropathy in humans, with a prevalence of approximately 1% worldwide. It is induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ion-resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich seed storage proteins, collectively referred to as gluten, found in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Related prolamins are present in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>). The incidence of both celiac disease and a related condition called nonceliac gluten sensitivity is increasing. This has prompted efforts to identify methods of lowering gluten in wheat, one of the most important cereal crops. Here, we used bulked segregant RNA sequencing and map-based cloning to identify the genetic lesion underlying a recessive, low-prolamin mutation (<i>lys3a</i>) in diploid barley. We confirmed the mutant identity by complementing the <i>lys3a</i> mutant with a transgenic copy of the wild-type barley gene and then used targeting-induced local lesions in genomes to identify induced single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the three homeologs of the corresponding wheat gene. Combining inactivating mutations in the three subgenomes of hexaploid bread wheat in a single wheat line lowered gliadin and low-molecular-weight glutenin accumulation by 50% to 60% and increased free and protein-bound lysine by 33%.</p>

Soluble and Membrane-Bound β-Glucosidases Are Involved in Trimming the Xyloglucan Backbone
<p>In many flowering plants, xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Xyloglucan can be degraded by a suite of exoglycosidases that remove specific sugars. In this work, we show that the xyloglucan backbone, formed by (1→4)-linked β-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl residues, can be attacked by two different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) β-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 3. While BGLC1 (At5g20950; for β-glucosidase active against xyloglucan 1) is responsible for all or most of the soluble activity, BGLC3 (At5g04885) is usually a membrane-anchored protein. Mutations in these two genes, whether on their own or combined with mutations in other exoglycosidase genes, resulted in the accumulation of partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ed xyloglucan subunits, such as GXXG, GXLG, or GXFG. While a mutation in <i>BGLC1</i> had significant effects on its own, lack of <i>BGLC3</i> had only minor effects. On the other hand, double <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> mutants revealed a synergistic interaction that supports a role for membrane-bound BGLC3 in xyloglucan metabolism. In addition, <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> was complemented by overexpression of either <i>BGLC1</i> or <i>BGLC3</i>. In overexpression lines, BGLC3 activity was concentrated in a microsome-enriched fraction but also was present in soluble form. Finally, both genes were generally expressed in the same cell types, although, in some cases, <i>BGLC3</i> was expressed at earlier stages than <i>BGLC1</i>. We propose that functional specialization could explain the separate localization of both enzymes, as a membrane-bound β-glucosidase could specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong> soluble xyloglucan without affecting the wall-bound polymer.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>, and therefore mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mastic</span></strong>atory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme
<p>Embryos of medaka <i>Oryzias latipes</i> hatch in freshwater, while those of killifish <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> hatch in brackish water. Medaka and <i>Fundulus</i> possess two kinds of hatching enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), which cooperatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong> their egg envelope at the time of hatching. Optimal salinity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two <i>Fundulus</i> HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each salinity at the time of hatching. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ion in various salinities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single site at position 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two enzymes. Superimposition of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that position 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active site cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that position 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with recognition of primary structure around the cleavage site, but with recognition of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As oxygen concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and rapid oxygen variations. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-oxygenation. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and oxygen consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-oxygenation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-oxygenation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to oxygen fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to oxygen variations.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security worldwide and is considered to be an optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> source for astronauts, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and ability to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its genome complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft genome sequence of Kd, using an optimized combination of high-throughput next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> genome assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on genome evolution.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and animal health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible animal model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of animal and human origin) is able to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this animal model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of animals with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Long-Chain Monounsaturated Fatty Acids and Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in 2 Prospective Cohorts
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Decades-old animal experiments suggested that dietary long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFAs) caused cardiotoxicity, leading, for example, development of Canola oil (Canadian oil low in erucic acid) from rapeseed. However, potential cardiotoxicity in humans and contemporary dietary sources of LCMUFAs are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We prospectively investigated the associations of plasma phospholipid LCMUFAs (20:1, 22:1, and 24:1), assessed as objective biomarkers of exposure, with incidence congestive heart failure in 2 independent cohorts: 3694 older adults (mean age, 75.2±5.2 years) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 1992–2006) and 3577 middle-aged adults (mean age, 54.1±5.8 years) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Minnesota subcohort (ARIC; 1987–2008). We further examined dietary correlates of circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC and US dietary sources of LCMUFAs in the 2003–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In CHS, 997 congestive heart failure events occurred during 39 238 person-years; in ARIC, 330 events congestive heart failure events occurred during 64 438 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, higher levels of 22:1 and 24:1 were positively associated with greater incident congestive heart failure in both CHS and ARIC; hazard ratios were 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.76) and 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.23) for highest versus lowest quintiles of 22:1, respectively, and 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23–2.50) and 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.22–3.03) for 24:1, respectively (<i>P</i> for trend ≤0.03 each).

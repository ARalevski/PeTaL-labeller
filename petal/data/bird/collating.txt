Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events to successfully activate a cellular response. On average, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that are an order of magnitude longer than the average agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that were spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing dwell time distribution rather than its average properties.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ions), to efficiently identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion site. We suggest that strains obtained by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in leaf cells.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing without influencing gating. Channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid soil. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid soils. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion, which facilitates adaptation to acid soils, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid soils.</p>

Retrotransposon-Mediated Aluminum Tolerance through Enhanced Expression of the Citrate Transporter OsFRDL4
<p>High aluminum (Al) tolerance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is controlled by multiple tolerance genes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these genes are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the factors regulating the expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i>, a gene encoding a citrate efflux transporter involved in Al-induced citrate secretion from the roots. Analysis with chromosome segment substitution lines derived from cv Nipponbare (high <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) and cv Kasalath (low <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) revealed that the differential expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i> is responsible for the quantitative trait locus for Al tolerance detected previously on chromosome 1. Comparison of the <i>OsFRDL4</i> gene structure in cv Nipponbare and cv Kasalath showed that there was no difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of the transcriptional start site, but a 1.2-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion showing high similarity to the solo long terminal repeat of the retrotransposon was found in the promoter region of <i>OsFRDL4</i> in cv Nipponbare. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion showed higher promoter activity and contained nine cis-acting elements for ALUMINUM RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (ART1). However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion did not alter the spatial expression or cellular localization of OsFRDL4. Furthermore, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion was found in most <i>japonica</i> varieties but was largely absent from <i>indica</i> varieties or wild rice species. These results indicate that the 1.2-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion in the <i>OsFRDL4</i> promoter region in <i>japonica</i> subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of <i>OsFRDL4</i> due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1. Our results also suggest that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion event happened at the initial stage of domestication of <i>japonica</i> subspecies.</p>

Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are still required to confirm the exact role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photosynthetic performance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) regulates the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine. Higher platelet PCTP expression is associated with increased platelet responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 thrombin receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects.

Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet responses on activation.

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (NBD) and a substrate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (SBD) connected by a linker that couples the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the release of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric connection between nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant tumors reprogram cellular metabolism to support cancer cell proliferation and survival. Although most cancers depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many cancer cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine metabolism in tumor cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive breast cancer. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote glutamine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast cancer tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive breast cancer cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive breast cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch.

Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability change. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability was oriented along the dimensions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific dimensions that were aligned with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.</p>

Targeted Endoplasmic Reticulum Localization of Storage Protein mRNAs Requires the RNA-Binding Protein RBP-L
<p>The transport and targeting of glutelin and prolamine mRNAs to distinct subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum is a model for mRNA localization in plants. This process requires a number of RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins (RBPs) that recognize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to mRNA cis-localization (zipcode) elements to form messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes, which then transport the RNAs to their destination sites at the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we present evidence that the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein, RBP-L, like its interacting RBP-P partner, specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to glutelin and prolamine zipcode RNA sequences and is required for proper mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. A transfer DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion in the 3′ untranslated region resulted in reduced expression of the <i>RBP</i>-<i>L</i> gene to 10% to 25% of that in the wild-type. Reduced amounts of RBP-L caused partial mislocalization of glutelin and prolamine RNAs and conferred other general growth defects, including dwarfism, late flowering, and smaller seeds. Transcriptome analysis showed that RBP-L knockdown greatly affected the expression of prolamine family genes and several classes of transcription factors. Collectively, these results indicate that RBP-L, like RBP-P, is a key RBP involved in mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, distinct from RBP-P, RBP-L exhibits additional regulatory roles in development, either directly through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to corresponding RNAs or indirectly through its effect on transcription factors.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>s through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>s in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>s was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong> stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-dissociation of the cap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

The GET System Inserts the Tail-Anchored Protein, SYP72, into Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome encodes homologs of the Guided Entry of Tail (GET)-anchored protein system for the posttranslational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. In yeast, TA proteins are loaded onto the cytosolic targeting factor Get3 and are then delivered to the membrane-associated Get1/2 complex for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion into ER membranes. The role of the GET system in Arabidopsis was investigated by monitoring the membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of a tail-anchored protein, SYP72, a syntaxin. SYP72 bound to yeast Get3 in vitro, forming a Get3-SYP72 fusion complex that could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ed into yeast GET1/2-containing proteoliposomes. The Arabidopsis GET system functioned in vivo to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong> TA proteins into ER membranes as demonstrated by the fact that the YFP-tagged SYP72 localized to the ER in wild-type plants but accumulated as cytoplasmic inclusions in <i>get1</i>, <i>get3</i>, or <i>get4</i> mutants. The GET mutants <i>get1</i> and <i>get3</i> were less tolerant of ER stress agents and showed symptoms of ER stress even under unstressed conditions. Hence, the GET system is responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of TA proteins into the ER in Arabidopsis, and mutants with GET dysfunctions are more susceptible to ER stress.</p>

TATA Box Insertion Provides a Selection Mechanism Underpinning Adaptations to Fe Deficiency
<p>Intraspecific genetic variation is essential for the responses and adaption of plants to evolutionary challenges, such as changing environmental conditions. The development of the Earth’s aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus <i>Malus</i> adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the <i>Iron-Regulated Transporter1</i> (<i>IRT1</i>) promoter. Specifically, an <i>IRT1</i> mutant allele with a TATA-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased <i>IRT1</i> expression. The altered <i>IRT1</i> promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of the TATA-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency. More broadly, this study reveals a new mechanism for enhancing gene expression to help plants adapt to different environments, providing new insights into molecular genetic divergence in plants.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions around the receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator transition in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition.

We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated insulator.

Molecular structure of human P-glycoprotein in the ATP-bound, outward-facing conformation

P-glycoprotein extrudes toxic molecules and drugs from cells through ATP-powered conformational changes. Despite decades of effort, only the structures of the inward-facing conformation of P-glycoprotein are available. Here we present the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing conformation, determined by cryo–electron microscopy at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The two nucleotide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domains form a closed dimer occluding two ATP molecules.

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their assembly in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels, selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its assembly in complex. How SEC11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site. Here, we identify a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> fragment. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex assembly.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and in more distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Transcription Factor WRKY75 Interacts with DELLA Proteins to Affect Flowering
<p>Flowering time is tightly controlled by both endogenous and exogenous signals. Although several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of WRKY transcription factors in floral initiation, the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways involved remain elusive. Here, we newly identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) WRKY DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein75 (WRKY75) as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive regulator of flowering initiation. Mutation of <i>WRKY75</i> resulted in a delay in flowering, whereas overexpression of <i>WRKY75</i> significantly accelerated flowering in Arabidopsis. Gene expression analysis showed that the transcript abundance of the flowering time integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>) was lower in <i>wrky75</i> mutants than in the wild type, but greater in <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that WRKY75 directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the promoter of <i>FT</i>. Both in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrated that WRKY75 interacts with DELLA proteins. We found that both REPRESSOR OF <i>ga1-3</i> (RGA) RGA-LIKE1 (RGL1) and GA INSENSITIVE (GAI) can repress the activation ability of WRKY75, thereby attenuating expression of its regulon. Genetic analyses indicated that <i>WRKY75</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively regulates flowering in a FT-dependent manner and overexpression of <i>RGL1</i> or gain-of-function of <i>GAI</i> could partially rescue the early flowering phenotype of <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that WRKY75 may function as a new component of the GA-mediated signaling pathway to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively regulate flowering in Arabidopsis.</p>

Characterization of Trichome-Expressed BAHD Acyltransferases in <i>Petunia axillaris</i> Reveals Distinct Acylsugar Assembly Mechanisms within the Solanaceae
<p>Acylsugars are synthesized in the glandular trichomes of the Solanaceae family and are implicated in protection against abiotic and biotic stress. Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), acylsugar assembly requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3′, and R2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. <i>Petunia</i> spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a <i>Petunia</i> <i>axillaris</i> transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses coupled with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar assembly is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In <i>P. axillaris</i>, tetra-acylsucrose assembly occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions. Notably, in <i>P. axillaris</i>, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion in tomato, is absent in <i>P. axillaris</i>. Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays. Overall, these data demonstrate the considerable evolutionary plasticity of acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Plant-Specific Preprotein and Amino Acid Transporter Proteins Are Required for tRNA Import into Mitochondria
<p>A variety of eukaryotes, in particular plants, do not contain the required number of tRNAs to support the translation of mitochondria-encoded genes and thus need to import tRNAs from the cytosol. This study identified two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) proteins, Tric1 and Tric2 (for tRNA import component), which on simultaneous inactivation by T-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion lines displayed a severely delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced tRNA import capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted tRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain of Tric1 and Tric2, a sterile-α-motif at the C-terminal end of the protein, was required to restore tRNA uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The purified predicted tRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s the T-arm of the tRNA for alanine with conserved lysine residues required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing. T-DNA inactivation of both Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in organello protein synthesis, which was mediated by a reorganization of the nuclear transcriptome, in particular of genes encoding a variety of proteins required for mitochondrial gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic insight into the process of tRNA import into mitochondria and supports the theory that the tRNA import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting protein import apparatus.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection varies between species and is significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I/IgA Immune Complexes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and gestational morbidity in patients with antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs). Predictive value of the presence of aPLs is low, and new markers are necessary to identify aPL carriers at higher risk and take preventive measures on them. The presence of circulating immune complexes of IgA bound to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (B2A-CIC) has been associated with occurrence of acute thrombotic events. In this work we study its possible predictive value for the appearance of acute thrombotic events in patients who are going to undergo transplant surgery, a well-known trigger of acute thrombotic events in aPL carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a follow-up study based on the Magnum 12+12 Cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant (n=1339).

An ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR-MYB Transcription Complex Regulates Furaneol Biosynthesis by Activating <i>QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE</i> Expression in Strawberry
<p>4-Hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone is a major contributor to the aroma of strawberry (<i>Fragaria</i> × <i>ananassa</i>) fruit, and the last step in its biosynthesis is catalyzed by strawberry quinone oxidoreductase (FaQR). Here, an ethylene response factor (FaERF#9) was characterized as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive regulator of the <i>FaQR</i> promoter. Linear regression analysis indicated that <i>FaERF#9</i> transcript levels were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated significantly with both <i>FaQR</i> transcripts and furanone content in different strawberry cultivars. Transient overexpression of <i>FaERF#9</i> in strawberry fruit significantly increased <i>FaQR</i> expression and furaneol production. Yeast one-hybrid assays, however, indicated that FaERF#9 by itself did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to the <i>FaQR</i> promoter. An MYB transcription factor (FaMYB98) identified in yeast one-hybrid screening of the strawberry cDNA library was capable of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the promoter and activating the transcription of <i>FaQR</i> by ∼5.6-fold. Yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation confirmed a direct protein-protein interaction between FaERF#9 and FaMYB98, and in combination, they activated the <i>FaQR</i> promoter 14-fold in transactivation assays. These results indicate that an ERF-MYB complex containing FaERF#9 and FaMYB98 activates the <i>FaQR</i> promoter and up-regulates 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone biosynthesis in strawberry.</p>

Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylates a Geminivirus Rep Protein to Impair Viral Replication and Infection
<p>Geminiviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide variety of plants and cause severe crop losses worldwide. The geminivirus replication initiator protein (Rep) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the viral replication origin and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation to initiate rolling circle replication. In this study, we found that the <i>Tomato golden mosaic virus</i> (TGMV) Rep is phosphorylated at serine-97 by sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), a master regulator of plant energy homeostasis and metabolism. Phosphorylation of Rep or the phosphomimic S97D mutation impaired Rep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to viral DNA. A TGMV DNA-A replicon containing the Rep S97D mutation replicated less efficiently in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) protoplasts than in wild-type or Rep phosphorylation-deficient replicons. The TGMV Rep-S97D mutant also was less infectious than the wild-type virus in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and was unable to infect tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Nearly all geminivirus Rep proteins have a serine residue at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion equivalent to TGMV Rep serine-97. SnRK1 phosphorylated the equivalent serines in the Rep proteins of <i>Tomato mottle virus</i> and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</i> and reduced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, suggesting that SnRK1 plays a key role in combating geminivirus infection. These results established that SnRK1 phosphorylates Rep and interferes with geminivirus replication and infection, underscoring the emerging role for SnRK1 in the host defense response against plant pathogens.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the chlorophyll-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this chlorophyll-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing chlorophyll biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insert</span></strong>ion of chlorophyll molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

Two B-Box Proteins Regulate Photomorphogenesis by Oppositely Modulating HY5 through their Diverse C-Terminal Domains
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BBX family comprises several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive and negative regulators of photomorphogenesis. BBX24, a member of BBX structural group IV, acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, whereas another member from the same group, BBX21, is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive regulator. The molecular basis for the functional diversity shown by these related BBX family members is unknown. Using domain-swap lines, we show that the C-terminal regions of BBX24 and BBX21 specify their function. Because both BBX21 and BBX24 work in close association with HY5, we hypothesized that these proteins differentially regulate the levels or activity of HY5 to fulfill their op<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>e roles. We show that BBX21 can regulate HY5 post-transcriptionally and the two proteins can coordinate to promote photomorphogenesis. By contrast, BBX24 interferes with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of HY5 to the promoter of an anthocyanin biosynthetic gene, possibly by heterodimerizing with HY5 and preventing it from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing DNA. Our finding that both BBX21 and BBX24 regulate HY5 activity post-transcriptionally, in op<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>e ways, suggests that closely related B-box proteins execute contrasting functions through differential regulation of HY5.</p>

Linking PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR to Histone Modification in Plant Shade Avoidance
<p>Shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) allows a plant grown in a densely populated environment to maximize opportunities to access to sunlight. Although it is well established that SAS is accompanied by gene expression changes, the underlying molecular mechanism needs to be elucidated. Here, we identify the H3K4me3/H3K36me3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins, Morf Related Gene (MRG) group proteins MRG1 and MRG2, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive regulators of shade-induced hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). MRG2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR7 (PIF7) and regulates the expression of several common downstream target genes, including <i>YUCCA8</i> and <i>IAA19</i> involved in the auxin biosynthesis or response pathway and <i>PRE1</i> involved in brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation. In response to shade, PIF7 and MRG2 are enriched at the promoter and gene-body regions and are necessary for increase of histone H4 and H3 acetylation to promote target gene expression. Our study uncovers a mechanism in which the shade-responsive factor PIF7 recruits MRG1/MRG2 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s H3K4me3/H3K36me3 and brings histone-acetylases to induce histone acetylations to promote expression of shade responsive genes, providing thus a molecular mechanistic link coupling the environmental light to epigenetic modification in regulation of hypocotyl elongation in plant SAS.</p>

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and development, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral development. Negative feedback regulation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative regulators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs regulate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for regulating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic plants, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA feedback regulation. Mutations in four GAF1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites abolished the negative feedback of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic plants. Our results showed that GAF1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites are necessary for GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>, suggesting that the DELLA-GAF1 complex is a main component of the GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>.</p>

POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS1, OsPRI1, Facilitates Iron Homeostasis
<p><i>Oryza sativa</i> HEMERYTHRIN MOTIF-CONTAINING REALLY INTERESTING NEW GENE AND ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN1 (OsHRZ1) is a putative iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sensor. However, it is unclear how OsHRZ1 transmits signals. In this study, we reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>IVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS1 (OsPRI1) interacts with OsHRZ1. A loss-of-function mutation to <i>OsPRI1</i> increased the sensitivity of plants to Fe-deficient conditions and down-regulated the expression of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the <i>OsIRO2</i> and <i>OsIRO3</i> promoters. In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1. Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild-type roots but increased in the <i>hrz1-2</i> mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1. The <i>hrz1-2</i> seedlings were insensitive to Fe-deficient conditions. When the <i>pri1-1</i> mutation was introduced into <i>hrz1-2</i> mutants, the <i>pri1hrz1</i> double mutant was more sensitive to Fe deficiency than the <i>hrz1-2</i> mutant. Additionally, the expression levels of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes were lower in the <i>hrz1pri1</i> double mutant than in the <i>hrz1-2</i> mutant. Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe deficiency by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively regulating <i>OsIRO2</i> and <i>OsIRO3</i> expression as part of the <i>OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3</i> signal transduction cascade.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

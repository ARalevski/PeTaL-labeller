Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (XX) versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> (XY) sex chromosome complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex chromosome complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex chromosome complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. AAAs from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Moreover, aortas from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex chromosome complement in phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs. Sex chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for sex-specific AAA therapeutics.</p></sec>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones, we were able to deduce whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> recognition template for conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>, and especially the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e, but that contained a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-like features, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e. Taken together, our data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e identification when a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes that become “co-opted” by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, we screened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s that is transferred to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-expressed paralog had no significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es by acting on a common, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed target. After duplication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p>Sexual competition among dioecious plants affects sex ratios and the spatial distribution of the sexes in different environments. At present, little is known about sexual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>us deltoides</i> as a model to investigate sex-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, or one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive ability between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es subjected to intrasexual competition were observed, although the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es was moderately greater under intersexual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the sex differences in competitive ability, especially under intersexual competition. Under salinity stress, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under intersexual competition. In addition, salt-stressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s growing intermixed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under salt stress can importantly affect the sex ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations.</p>

Using nature to understand nurture

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome
<p>The red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, follows an XX (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e) and XY (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>) sex determination system. Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX insects to follow the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sex determination in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (XX) that are fertile. The virgin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es mated with these masculinized genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es produced all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sex determination is present on the Y chromosome. These data also suggest that the Y chromosome in <i>T. castaneum</i> is not required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> fertility.</p>

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are significant sexual differences in the morphological and physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder under stressful conditions. However, little is known about sex-specific differences in responses to nutrient deficiencies. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies on the morphological, physiological and chloroplast ultrastructural traits of <i>P. cathayana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were investigated. The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both sexes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher photosynthesis, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in chloroplasts than did <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es when exposed to N- and P-deficiency conditions. Nitrogen-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher glutamate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities, and a more intact chloroplast ultrastructure, but less starch accumulation than did N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Phosphorus-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and acid phosphatase activities, but a lower foliar N : P ratio and less PSII damage than did P-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These results suggest that N and P deficiencies cause greater negative effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es than on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, and that the different sexes of <i>P. cathayana</i> may employ different strategies to cope with N and P deficiencies.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, a shallower gradient was observed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es as compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. Between-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

This preference shift did not occur in control experiments in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s with free access to food or in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e demonstrators solving these extractive foraging problems. Our results suggest that direct observation of problem-solving skills increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> attractiveness and that this could contribute to the evolution of the cognitive abilities underlying such skills.</p>

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pattern of the reproductive system is established by default because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium was responsible for the retention of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian ducts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian duct maintenance.</p>

Down-regulation of the Sucrose Transporter <i>CsSUT1</i> Causes Male Sterility by Altering Carbohydrate Supply
<p>In plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility, but it remains unclear whether Suc transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-affinity Suc-H<sup>+</sup> symporter. <i>CsSUT1</i> is expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen, and companion cells of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments, and pedicel. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flowers of <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNA interference (RNAi) lines exhibited a decrease in Suc, hexose, and starch content, relative to those of the wild type, during the later stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flower development, a finding that was highly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport, and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most <i>myeloblastosis</i> (<i>MYB</i>) transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNAi lines relative to wild type. Our findings demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <i>CsSUT1</i> expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific <i>MYB</i> transcription factors. This knowledge provides a new approach for bioengineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility in crop plants.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation to mainland brown bears. Due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation differentiation, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Risk of Dementia in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>More <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with congenital heart disease (CHD) are surviving to adulthood, and CHD is associated with risk factors for dementia. We compared the risk of dementia in CHD adults to that of the general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this cohort study, we used medical registries and a medical record review covering all Danish hospitals to identify adults with CHD diagnosed between 1963 and 2012. These individuals with CHD were followed from January 1, 1981, 30 years of age, or date of first CHD registration (index date for matched members of the general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation cohort) until hospital diagnosis of dementia, death, emigration, or end of study (December 31, 2012). For each individual with CHD, we identified 10 members of the general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation utilizing the Danish Civil Registration System matched on sex and birth year. We computed cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia, adjusting for sex and birth year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cumulative incidence of dementia was 4% by 80 years of age in 10 632 adults with CHD (46% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>).

Race and Sex Differences in Post–Myocardial Infarction Angina Frequency and Risk of 1-Year Unplanned Rehospitalization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Race and sex disparities in in-hospital treatment and outcomes of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) have been described, but little is known about race and sex differences in post-MI angina and long-term risk of unplanned rehospitalization. We examined race and sex differences in post-MI angina frequency and 1-year unplanned rehospitalization to identify factors associated with unplanned rehospitalization, testing for whether race and sex modify these relationships.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using TRANSLATE-ACS (Treatment With Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome) data, we examined 6-week and 1-year angina frequency and 1-year unplanned rehospitalization stratified by race and sex among MI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess factors associated with unplanned rehospitalization and tested for interactions among angina frequency, race, and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 11 595 MI patients survived to 1 year postdischarge; there were 66.6% white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> patients, 24.3% white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e patients, 5.3% black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> patients, and 3.8% black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e patients.

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal contamination, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>us cathayana</i> Rehder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s improved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-contaminated soils.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation size and intense and durable heat-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones generated heat even in cool weather conditions. Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones produced heat, but to a lesser extent than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation, which, in turn, correlates positively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s were quicker to court <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

Impacts of historical warming on marine fisheries production
<p>Climate change is altering habitats for marine fishes and invertebrates, but the net effect of these changes on potential food production is unknown. We used temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation models to measure the influence of warming on the productivity of 235 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations responded significantly positively (<i>n</i> = 9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations) and others responded significantly negatively (<i>n</i> = 19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations decreased by 4.1% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35%. Outcomes of fisheries management—including long-term food provisioning—will be improved by accounting for changing productivity in a warmer ocean.</p>

Changes in the microbiota cause genetically modified <i>Anopheles</i> to spread in a population
<p>The mosquito’s innate immune system controls both <i>Plasmodium</i> and bacterial infections. We investigated the competitiveness of mosquitoes genetically modified to alter expression of their own anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> immune genes in a mixed-cage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation with wild-type mosquitoes. We observed that genetically modified mosquitoes with increased immune activity in the midgut tissue did not have an observed fitness disadvantage and showed reduced microbial loads in both the midgut and reproductive organs. These changes result in a mating preference of genetically modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s for wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, whereas wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s prefer genetically modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These changes foster the spread of the genetic modification in a mosquito cage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation.</p>

Protecting unauthorized immigrant mothers improves their children’s mental health
<p>The United States is embroiled in a debate about whether to protect or deport its estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants, but the fact that these immigrants are also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>s to more than 4 million U.S.-born <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> is often overlooked. We provide causal evidence of the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>s’ unauthorized immigration status on the health of their U.S. citizen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program granted temporary protection from deportation to more than 780,000 unauthorized immigrants. We used Medicaid claims data from Oregon and exploited the quasi-random assignment of DACA eligibility among mothers with birthdates close to the DACA age qualification cutoff. Mothers’ DACA eligibility significantly decreased adjustment and anxiety disorder diagnoses among their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>s’ unauthorized status is thus a substantial barrier to normal child development and perpetuates health inequalities through the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.</p>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940
<p>We estimated rates of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who earn more than their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>s—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> born in 1940 to 50% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.</p>

Metabolome Analysis of Multi-Connected Biparental Chromosome Segment Substitution Line Populations
<p>Metabolomic analysis coupled with advanced genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations represents a powerful tool with which to investigate the plant metabolome. However, genetic analyses of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) metabolome have been conducted mainly using natural accessions or a single bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation. Here, the flag leaves from three interconnected chromosome segment substitution line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations with a common recurrent genetic background were used to dissect rice metabolic diversity. We effectively used multiple interconnected bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations, constructed by introducing genomic segments into Zhenshan 97 from ACC10 (A/Z), Minghui 63 (M/Z), and Nipponbare (N/Z), to map metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A total of 1,587 mQTL were generated, of which 684, 479, and 722 were obtained from the A/Z, M/Z, and N/Z chromosome segment substitution line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations, respectively, and we designated 99 candidate genes for 367 mQTL. In addition, 1,001 mQTL were generated specifically from joint linkage analysis with 25 candidate genes assigned. Several of these candidates were validated, such as <i>LOC_Os07g01020</i> for the in vivo content of pyridoxine and its derivative and <i>LOC_Os04g25980</i> for cis-zeatin glucosyltransferase activity. We propose a novel biosynthetic pathway for <i>O</i>-methylapigenin <i>C</i>-pentoside and demonstrated that <i>LOC_Os04g11970</i> encodes a component of this pathway through fine-mapping. We postulate that the methylated apigenin may confer plant disease resistance. This study demonstrates the power of using multiple interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations to generate a large number of veritable mQTL. The combined results are discussed in the context of functional metabolomics and the possible features of assigned candidates underlying respective metabolites.</p>

Parental DNA Methylation States Are Associated with Heterosis in Epigenetic Hybrids
<p>Despite the importance and wide exploitation of heterosis in commercial crop breeding, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not completely understood. Recent studies have implicated changes in DNA methylation and small RNAs in hybrid performance; however, it remains unclear whether epigenetic changes are a cause or a consequence of heterosis. Here, we analyze a large panel of over 500 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epigenetic hybrid plants (epiHybrids), which we derived from near-isogenic but epigenetically divergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>s. This proof-of-principle experimental system allowed us to quantify the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al methylation differences to heterosis. We measured traits such as leaf area, growth rate, flowering time, main stem branching, rosette branching, and final plant height and observed several strong positive and negative heterotic phenotypes among the epiHybrids. Using an epigenetic quantitative trait locus mapping approach, we were able to identify specific differentially methylated regions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al genomes that are associated with hybrid performance. Sequencing of methylomes, transcriptomes, and genomes of selected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>-epiHybrid combinations further showed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al differentially methylated regions most likely mediate the remodeling of methylation and transcriptional states at specific loci in the hybrids. Taken together, our data suggest that locus-specific epigenetic divergence between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al lines can directly or indirectly trigger heterosis in Arabidopsis hybrids independent of genetic changes. These results add to a growing body of evidence that points to epigenetic factors as one of the key determinants of hybrid performance.</p>

Gibberellin Induces Diploid Pollen Formation by Interfering with Meiotic Cytokinesis
<p>The plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) controls many physiological processes, including cell differentiation, cell elongation, seed germination, and response to abiotic stress. In this study, we report that exogenous treatment of flowering Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with GA specifically affects the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis leading to meiotic restitution and the production of diploid (2n) pollen grains. Similar defects in meiotic cell division and reproductive ploidy stability occur in Arabidopsis plants depleted of RGA and GAI, two members of the DELLA family that function as suppressor of GA signaling. Cytological analysis of the double <i>rga-24 gai-t6</i> mutant revealed that defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis are not caused by alterations in meiosis I (MI or meiosis II (MII) chromosome dynamics, but instead result from aberrations in the spatial organization of the phragmoplast-like radial microtubule arrays (RMAs) at the end of meiosis II. In line with a role for GA in the genetic regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive system, we additionally show that DELLA downstream targets MYB33 and MYB65 are redundantly required for functional RMA biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis. By analyzing the expression of <i>pRGA::GFP-RGA</i> in the wild-type Landsberg <i>erecta</i> background, we demonstrate that the GFP-RGA protein is specifically expressed in the anther cell layers surrounding the meiocytes and microspores, suggesting that appropriate GA signaling in the somatic anther tissue is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cell wall formation and thus plays an important role in consolidating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> gametophytic ploidy consistency.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s fighting. We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at diagnosis was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with variable disease outcomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following diagnosis.

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This document provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and adolescents is provided.

Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Selective trade-offs maintain alleles underpinning complex trait variation in plants
<p>To understand evolutionary factors that maintain complex trait variation, we sequenced genomes from a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation of the plant <i>Mimulus guttatus</i>, identifying hundreds of nucleotide variants associated with morphological and life history traits. Alleles that delayed flowering also increased size at reproduction, which suggests pervasive antagonistic pleiotropy in this annual plant. The “large and slow” alleles, which were less common in small, rapidly flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations, became more abundant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations with greater plant size. Furthermore, natural selection within the field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation favored alternative alleles from year to year. Our results suggest that environmental fluctuations and selective trade-offs maintain polygenic trait variation within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations and also contribute to the geographic divergence in this wildflower species.</p>

Ductal sex determination
<p>How the physical differences between the sexes develop is an intriguing process. In mammals, the first important stage in sex determination occurs during fetal life, when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-determining Y chromosome expresses a gene called <i>sex determining region Y</i> (<i>SRY</i>), which acts on the bipotential gonad to initiate testis (instead of ovary) formation (<i>1</i>). Landmark experiments by Jost in the 1950s showed that the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific structures is established by factors produced from the emerging testis, namely androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (<i>2</i>). This suggested that the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> characteristics is an active process, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific differentiation is passive. On page 717 of this issue, Zhao <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e development is also an active process.</p>

Winter storms drive rapid phenotypic, regulatory, and genomic shifts in the green anole lizard
<p>Extreme environmental perturbations offer opportunities to observe the effects of natural selection in wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations. During the winter of 2013–2014, the southeastern United States endured an extreme cold event. We used thermal performance, transcriptomics, and genome scans to measure responses of lizard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations to storm-induced selection. We found significant increases in cold tolerance at the species’ southern limit. Gene expression in southern survivors shifted toward patterns characteristic of northern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations. Comparing samples before and after the extreme winter, 14 genomic regions were differentiated in the surviving southern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation; four also exhibited signatures of local adaptation across the latitudinal gradient and implicate genes involved in nervous system function. Together, our results suggest that extreme winter events can rapidly produce strong selection on natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations at multiple biological levels that recapitulate geographic patterns of local adaptation.</p>

Cognitive science in the field: A preschool intervention durably enhances intuitive but not formal mathematics
<p>Many poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> are underprepared for demanding primary school curricula. Research in cognitive science suggests that school achievement could be improved by preschool pedagogy in which numerate adults engage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s spontaneous, nonsymbolic mathematical concepts. To test this suggestion, we designed and evaluated a game-based preschool curriculum intended to exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s emerging skills in number and geometry. In a randomized field experiment with 1540 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (average age 4.9 years) in 214 Indian preschools, 4 months of math game play yielded marked and enduring improvement on the exercised intuitive abilities, relative to no-treatment and active control conditions. Math-trained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> also showed immediate gains on symbolic mathematical skills but displayed no advantage in subsequent learning of the language and concepts of school mathematics.</p>

Male sex in houseflies is determined by <i>Mdmd</i>, a paralog of the generic splice factor gene <i>CWC22</i>
<p>Across species, animals have diverse sex determination pathways, each consisting of a hierarchical cascade of genes and its associated regulatory mechanism. Houseflies have a distinctive polymorphic sex determination system in which a dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> determiner, the M-factor, can reside on any of the chromosomes. We identified a gene, <i>Musca domestica</i> <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> determiner</i> (<i>Mdmd</i>), as the M-factor. <i>Mdmd</i> originated from a duplication of the spliceosomal factor gene <i>CWC22</i> (<i>nucampholin</i>). Targeted <i>Mdmd</i> disruption results in complete sex reversal to fertile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es because of a shift from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e expression of the downstream genes <i>transformer</i> and <i>doublesex</i>. The presence of <i>Mdmd</i> on different chromosomes indicates that <i>Mdmd</i> translocated to different genomic sites. Thus, an instructive signal in sex determination can arise by duplication and neofunctionalization of an essential splicing regulator.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates seed development immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of seed development after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed development.</p>

Photosynthetic Efficiency as Bioindicator of Environmental Pressure in <i>A. halleri</i>
<p>In earlier ecophysiological studies that were conducted on <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> plants, scientists focused on the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation but did not take into consideration the environmental factors that can significantly affect the physiological responses of plants in situ. In this study, we investigated <i>A. halleri</i> that was growing on two nonmetalliferous and three metalliferous sites, which were characterized by different environmental conditions. We compared these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations in order to find differences within the metallicolous and nonmetallicolous groups that have not yet been investigated. The concentrations of several elements in the plant and soil samples also were investigated. To our knowledge, the concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll were measured for <i>A. halleri</i> in situ for the first time. Our study confirmed the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn for each metallicolous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation. For the metallicolous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations, the inhibition of parameters that describe the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus with increasing accumulations of heavy metals in the shoots also was observed. It was found that the nonmetallicolous plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations from the summit of Ciemniak Mountain had larger antenna dimensions and chlorophyll content but a lower percentage of active reaction centers. To our knowledge, in this study, the internal high physiological diversity within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations that inhabit metalliferous and nonmetalliferous sites is presented for the first time.</p>

The Genetics of Leaf Flecking in Maize and Its Relationship to Plant Defense and Disease Resistance
<p>Physiological leaf spotting, or flecking, is a mild-lesion phenotype observed on the leaves of several commonly used maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines and has been anecdotally linked to enhanced broad-spectrum disease resistance. Flecking was assessed in the maize nested association mapping (NAM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation, comprising 4,998 recombinant inbred lines from 25 bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parent</span></strong>al families, and in an association <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation, comprising 279 diverse maize inbreds. Joint family linkage analysis was conducted with 7,386 markers in the NAM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation. Genome-wide association tests were performed with 26.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NAM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation and with 246,497 SNPs in the association <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation, resulting in the identification of 18 and three loci associated with variation in flecking, respectively. Many of the candidate genes colocalizing with associated SNPs are similar to genes that function in plant defense response via cell wall modification, salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent pathways, redox homeostasis, stress response, and vesicle trafficking/remodeling. Significant positive correlations were found between increased flecking, stronger defense response, increased disease resistance, and increased pest resistance. A nonlinear relationship with total kernel weight also was observed whereby lines with relatively high levels of flecking had, on average, lower total kernel weight. We present evidence suggesting that mild flecking could be used as a selection criterion for breeding programs trying to incorporate broad-spectrum disease resistance.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ation size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Transmission between Archaic and Modern Human Ancestors during the Evolution of the Oncogenic Human Papillomavirus 16
<p>Every human suffers through life a number of papillomaviruses (PVs) infections, most of them asymptomatic. A notable exception are persistent infections by <i>Human papillomavirus 16</i> (HPV16), the most oncogenic infectious agent for humans and responsible for most infection-driven anogenital cancers. Oncogenic potential is not homogeneous among HPV16 lineages, and genetic variation within HPV16 exhibits some geographic structure. However, an in-depth analysis of the HPV16 evolutionary history was still wanting. We have analyzed extant HPV16 diversity and compared the evolutionary and phylogeographical patterns of humans and of HPV16. We show that codivergence with modern humans explains at most 30% of the present viral geographical distribution. The most explanatory scenario suggests that ancestral HPV16 already infected ancestral human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations and that viral lineages co-diverged with the hosts in parallel with the split between archaic Neanderthal-Denisovans and ancestral modern human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations, generating the ancestral HPV16A and HPV16BCD viral lineages, respectively. We propose that after out-of-Africa migration of modern human ancestors, sexual transmission between human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations introduced HPV16A into modern human ancestor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations. We hypothesize that differential coevolution of HPV16 lineages with different but closely related ancestral human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">popul</span></strong>ations and subsequent host-switch events in parallel with introgression of archaic alleles into the genomes of modern human ancestors may be largely responsible for the present-day differential prevalence and association with cancers for HPV16 variants.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

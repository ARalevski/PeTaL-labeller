The dual frontier: Patented inventions and prior scientific advance
<p>The extent to which scientific advances support marketplace <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong>ions is largely unknown. We study 4.8 million U.S. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s and 32 million research articles to determine the minimum citation distance between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong>ions and prior scientific advances. We find that most cited research articles (80%) link forward to a future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>. Similarly, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s (61%) link backward to a prior research article. Linked papers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s typically stand 2 to 4 degrees distant from the other domain. Yet, advances directly along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>-paper boundary are notably more impactful within their own domains. The distance metric further provides a typology of the fields, institutions, and individuals involved in science-to-technology linkages. Overall, the findings are consistent with theories that emphasize substantial and fruitful connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing and prior scientific inquiry.</p>

The applied value of public investments in biomedical research
<p>Scientists and policy-makers have long argued that public investments in science have practical applications. Using data on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s linked to U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants over a 27-year period, we provide a large-scale accounting of linkages between public research investments and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing. We find that about 10% of NIH grants generate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong> directly but 30% generate articles that are subsequently cited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s. Although policy-makers often focus on direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing by academic scientists, the bulk of the effect of NIH research on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing appears to be indirect. We also find no systematic relationship between the “basic” versus “applied” research focus of a grant and its propensity to be cited by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>.</p>

Chiral Lewis acids integrated with single-walled carbon nanotubes for asymmetric catalysis in water
<p>The development of highly reactive and stereoselective catalytic systems is required not only to improve existing synthetic methods but also to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong> distinct chemical reactions. Herein, a homogenized combination of nickel-based Lewis acid–surfactant-combined catalysts and single-walled carbon nanotubes is shown to exhibit substantial activity in water. In addition to the enhanced reactivity, stereoselective performance and long-term stability were demonstrated in asymmetric conjugate addition reactions of aldoximes to furnish chiral nitrones in high yields with excellent selectivities. The practical and straightforward application of the designed catalysts in water provides an expedient, environmentally benign, and highly efficient pathway to access optically active compounds.</p>

Unlocking P(V): Reagents for chiral phosphorothioate synthesis
<p>Phosphorothioate nucleotides have emerged as powerful pharmacological substitutes of their native phosphodiester analogs with important translational applications in antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics and cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) synthesis. Stereocontrolled installation of this chiral motif has long been hampered by the systemic use of phosphorus(III) [P(III)]–based reagent systems as the sole practical means of oligonucleotide assembly. A fundamentally different approach is described herein: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong>ion of a P(V)-based reagent platform for programmable, traceless, diastereoselective phosphorus-sulfur incorporation. The power of this reagent system is demonstrated through the robust and stereocontrolled synthesis of various nucleotidic architectures, including ASOs and CDNs, via an efficient, inexpensive, and operationally simple protocol.</p>

Neurotechnology to address big questions
<p>Emotions, cognition, and consciousness emerge with the processing of neuronal information provided by memory readouts and senses. How this actually works seemed for a long time to be a question too big to ask. Advances in neuroscience have always been driven by methodological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong>ions, and current efforts to develop neurotechnologies are motivated by experimental strategies, including analytical dissection (that is, inverse engineering), large-scale interrogation, and synthetic reconstruction of the mammalian cerebral cortex (which is important for higher cognitive functions) and connected brain structures (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). As part of this neurotechnological endeavor, mapping the transcriptome of neurons with single-cell resolution and with known three-dimensional tissue localization has been a long-sought enabling technology (<i>3</i>). On page 380 of this issue, Wang <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) present the technology and workflow to access transcriptional states of more than 100 genes from up to 30,000 cells in a cubic millimeter of cortical tissue. This advanced methodology will facilitate studies that improve our understanding of the neuronal hardware and, when combined with other emerging neurotechnologies, will enable big questions in neuroscience to be addressed.</p>

Early emergence of cortical interneuron diversity in the mouse embryo
<p>GABAergic interneurons (GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid) regulate neural-circuit activity in the mammalian cerebral cortex. These cortical interneurons are structurally and functionally diverse. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to study the origins of this diversity in the mouse. We identify distinct types of progenitor cells and newborn neurons in the ganglionic eminences, the embryonic proliferative regions that give rise to cortical interneurons. These embryonic precursors show temporally and spatially restricted transcriptional patterns that lead to different classes of interneurons in the adult cerebral cortex. Our findings suggest that shortly after the interneurons become postmitotic, their diversity is already <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong> in their diverse transcriptional programs, which subsequently guide further differentiation in the developing cortex.</p>

Elevated <i>HLA-A</i> expression impairs HIV control through inhibition of NKG2A-expressing cells
<p>The highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) locus encodes cell surface proteins that are critical for immunity. <i>HLA-A</i> expression levels vary in an allele-dependent manner, diversifying allele-specific effects beyond peptide-binding preference. Analysis of 9763 HIV-infected individuals from 21 cohorts shows that higher <i>HLA-A</i> levels confer poorer control of HIV. Elevated <i>HLA-A</i> expression provides enhanced levels of an HLA-A–derived signal peptide that specifically binds and determines expression levels of HLA-E, the ligand for the inhibitory NKG2A natural killer (NK) cell receptor. <i>HLA-B</i> haplotypes that favor NKG2A-mediated NK cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">licens</span></strong>ing (i.e., education) exacerbate the deleterious effect of high <i>HLA-A</i> on HIV control, consistent with NKG2A-mediated inhibition impairing NK cell clearance of HIV-infected targets. Therapeutic blockade of HLA-E:NKG2A interaction may yield benefit in HIV disease.</p>

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin
<p>The release of paused RNA polymerase II into productive elongation is highly regulated, especially at genes that affect human development and disease. To exert control over this rate-limiting step, we designed sequence-specific synthetic transcription elongation factors (Syn-TEFs). These molecules are composed of programmable DNA-binding ligands flexibly tethered to a small molecule that engages the transcription elongation machinery. By limiting activity to targeted loci, Syn-TEFs convert constituent modules from broad-spectrum inhibitors of transcription into gene-specific stimulators. Here we present Syn-TEF1, a molecule that actively enables transcription across repressive GAA repeats that silence frataxin expression in Friedreich’s ataxia, a terminal neurodegenerative disease with no effective therapy. The modular design of Syn-TEF1 defines a general framework for developing a class of molecules that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">licens</span></strong>e transcription elongation at targeted genomic loci.</p>

Industrializing animals
<p>What does the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong>ion of the chicken nugget in 1963 have to do with a 1999 outbreak of urinary tract infections in Berkeley undergraduates? More than you might realize, writes journalist Maryn McKenna: Both, she argues, are ultimately due to the industrialization of chicken farming during the 20th century. In <i>Big Chicken</i>, she skillfully weaves together the interre­lated threads of agricultural industrialization, antibiotic misuse, and food safety issues in a highly readable and engaging narrative.</p>

TreeScaper: Visualizing and Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Sets of Trees
<p>Modern phylogenomic analyses often result in large collections of phylogenetic trees representing uncertainty in individual gene trees, variation across genes, or both. Extracting phylogenetic signal from these tree sets can be challenging, as they are difficult to visualize, explore, and quantify. To overcome some of these challenges, we have developed TreeScaper, an application for tree set visualization as well as the identification of distinct phylogenetic signals. GUI and command-line versions of TreeScaper and a manual with tutorials can be downloaded from <ext-link>https://github.com/whuang08/TreeScaper/releases</ext-link>.

Comparison Between Patent Ductus Arteriosus Stent and Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt as Palliation for Infants With Ductal-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow may undergo palliation with either a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong> ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent or a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt. A balanced multicenter comparison of these 2 approaches is lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow palliated with either a PDA stent or a BT shunt from January 2008 to November 2015 were reviewed from the 4 member centers of the Congenital Catheterization Research Collaborative. Outcomes were compared by use of propensity score adjustment to account for baseline differences between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred six patients with a PDA stent and 251 patients with a BT shunt were included. The groups differed in underlying anatomy (expected 2-ventricle circulation in 60% of PDA stents versus 45% of BT shunts; <i>P</i>=0.001) and presence of antegrade pulmonary blood flow (61% of PDA stents versus 38% of BT shunts; <i>P</i><0.001). After propensity score adjustment, there was no difference in the hazard of the primary composite outcome of death or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–1.23; <i>P</i>=0.31). Other reinterventions were more common in the PDA stent group (hazard ratio, 29.8; 95% CI, 9.8–91.1; <i>P</i><0.001). However, the PDA stent group had a lower adjusted intensive care unit length of stay (5.3 days [95% CI, 4.2–6.7] versus 9.19 days [95% CI, 7.9–10.6]; <i>P</i><0.001), a lower risk of diuretic use at discharge (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.25–0.64; <i>P</i><0.001) and procedural complications (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.77; <i>P</i>=0.006), and larger (152 mm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> [95% CI, 132–176] versus 125 mm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> [95% CI, 113–138]; <i>P</i>=0.029) and more symmetrical (symmetry index, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.8–0.89] versus 0.77 [95% CI, 0.75–0.8]; <i>P</i>=0.008] pulmonary arteries at the time of subsequent surgical repair or last follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this multicenter comparison of palliative PDA stent and BT shunt for infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow adjusted for differences in patient factors, there was no difference in the primary end point, death or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis. However, other markers of morbidity and pulmonary artery size favored the PDA stent group, supporting PDA stent as a reasonable alternative to BT shunt in select patients.</p></sec>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent of mGluR3 quantitatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods
<p>Materials and systems that statically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> radiation in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpin the performance of many entrenched technologies, including building insulation, energy-conserving windows, spacecraft components, electronics shielding, container packaging, protective clothing, and camouflage platforms.

By drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ing platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability.

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of diffusion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) diffuses with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> diffusing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that diffusion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ing sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space. Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)<sub>HP</sub>] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

Radar evidence of subglacial liquid water on Mars

We surveyed the Planum Australe region using the MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) instrument, a low-frequency radar on the Mars Express spacecraft. Radar profiles collected between May 2012 and December 2015 contain evidence of liquid water trapped below the ice of the South Polar Layered Deposits. Anomalously bright subsurface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions are evident within a well-defined, 20-kilometer-wide zone centered at 193°E, 81°S, which is surrounded by much less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ive areas. Quantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (>15), matching that of water-bearing materials.

The image-forming mirror in the eye of the scallop
<p>Scallops possess a visual system comprising up to 200 eyes, each containing a concave mirror rather than a lens to focus light.

The layered structure of the mirror is tuned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> the wavelengths of light penetrating the scallop’s habitat and is tiled with a mosaic of square guanine crystals, which reduces optical aberrations. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina used for separately imaging the peripheral and central fields of view.

Anti-coalescence of bosons on a lossy beam splitter
<p>Two-boson interference, a fundamentally quantum effect, has been extensively studied with photons through the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and observed with guided plasmons. Using two freely propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interfering on a lossy beam splitter, we show that the presence of loss enables us to modify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion and transmission factors of the beam splitter, thus revealing quantum interference paths that do not exist in a lossless configuration. We investigate the two-plasmon interference on beam splitters with different sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion and transmission factors. Through coincidence-detection measurements, we observe either coalescence or anti-coalescence of SPPs. The results show that losses can be viewed as a degree of freedom to control quantum processes.</p>

Observation of Anderson localization in disordered nanophotonic structures
<p>Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in disordered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the disordered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a disordered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong disorder-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in transmission, or the opposite feature of enhanced transmission. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing.</p>

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking dynamical phenomena. We experimentally investigated the quantum motion of an impurity atom immersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose liquid and subject to an external force. We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum liquid they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic dynamics, reminiscent of Bloch oscillations, although the quantum liquid is translationally invariant. Our observations are supported by large-scale numerical simulations.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen

Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures.

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance

However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the foundation of coral-reef ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can grow photoautotrophically, it can grow mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a metabolite normally transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and alterations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these physiological changes were correlated with changes in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little change in their abundances. However, the altered carbon metabolism in Glc-supplemented cells was correlated with modest alterations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy metabolism and cellular physiology, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic physiological changes that are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed by major changes in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Although recent studies have investigated the dynamic transcriptome during berry development, most have focused on a single grapevine variety, so there is a lack of comparative data representing different cultivars. Here, we report, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide transcriptional analysis of 120 RNA samples corresponding to 10 Italian grapevine varieties collected at four growth stages. The 10 varieties, representing five red-skinned and five white-skinned berries, were all cultivated in the same experimental vineyard to reduce environmental variability. The comparison of transcriptional changes during berry formation and ripening allowed us to determine the transcriptomic traits common to all varieties, thus defining the core transcriptome of berry development, as well as the transcriptional dynamics underlying differences between red and white berry varieties. A greater variation among the red cultivars than between red and white cultivars at the transcriptome level was revealed, suggesting that anthocyanin accumulation during berry maturation has a direct impact on the transcriptomic regulation of multiple biological processes. The expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid/flavonoid biosynthesis clearly distinguished the behavior of red and white berry genotypes during ripening but also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed the differential accumulation of anthocyanins in the red berries, indicating some form of cross talk between the activation of stilbene biosynthesis and the accumulation of anthocyanins in ripening berries.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently identified as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was identified as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also identified as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk.

The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs.

Comparative Prognostic Utility of Indexes of Microvascular Function Alone or in Combination in Patients With an Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is frequently successful at restoring coronary artery blood flow in patients with acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction; however, failed myocardial reperfusion commonly passes undetected in up to half of these patients. The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a novel invasive measure of coronary microvascular function. We aimed to investigate the pathological and prognostic significance of an IMR>40, alone or in combination with a coronary flow reserve (CFR≤2.0), in the culprit artery after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction were prospectively enrolled during emergency percutaneous coronary intervention and categorized according to IMR (≤40 or >40) and CFR (≤2.0 or >2.0). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was acquired 2 days and 6 months after myocardial infarction. All-cause death or first heart failure hospitalization was a prespecified outcome (median follow-up, 845 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IMR and CFR were measured in the culprit artery at the end of percutaneous coronary intervention in 283 patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (mean±SD age, 60±12 years; 73% male). The median IMR and CFR were 25 (interquartile range, 15–48) and 1.6 (interquartile range, 1.1–2.1), respectively. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of myocardial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–4.27; <i>P</i>=0.042). An IMR>40 was closely associated with microvascular obstruction. Symptom-to-reperfusion time, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) blush grade, and no (≤30%) ST-segment resolution were not associated with these pathologies. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent, −2.12; 95% confidence interval, −4.02 to −0.23; <i>P</i>=0.028) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent, 7.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–15.29; <i>P</i>=0.039) at 6 months independently of infarct size. An IMR>40 (odds ratio, 4.36; 95% confidence interval, 2.10–9.06; <i>P</i><0.001) was a multivariable associate of all-cause death or heart failure. Compared with an IMR>40, the combination of IMR>40 and CFR≤2.0 did not have incremental prognostic value.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An IMR>40 is a multivariable associate of left ventricular and clinical outcomes after ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction independently of the infarction size. Compared with standard clinical measures of the efficacy of myocardial reperfusion, including the ischemic time, ST-segment elevation, angiographic blush grade, and CFR, IMR has superior clinical value for risk stratification and may be considered a reference test for failed myocardial reperfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https//www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later.

The Pearson correlation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method.

A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (mean   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were managed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1).

Measuring the migration of the components and polyethylene wear after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the components and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in position and orientation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>   the migration of the components and the penetration of the femoral   head.

Comparison of the complete genome sequences of four γ-hexachlorocyclohexane-degrading bacterial strains: insights into the evolution of bacteria able to degrade a recalcitrant man-made pesticide
<p>γ-Hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) is a recalcitrant man-made chlorinated pesticide. Here, the complete genome sequences of four γ-HCH-degrading sphingomonad strains, which are most unlikely to have been derived from one ancestral γ-HCH degrader, were compared. Together with several experimental data, we showed that (i) all the four strains carry almost identical <i>linA</i> to <i>linE</i> genes for the conversion of γ-HCH to maleylacetate (designated “specific” <i>lin</i> genes), (ii) considerably different genes are used for the metabolism of maleylacetate in one of the four strains, and (iii) the <i>linKLMN</i> genes for the putative ABC transporter necessary for γ-HCH utilization exhibit structural divergence, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s the phylogenetic relationship of their hosts. Replicon organization and location of the <i>lin</i> genes in the four genomes are significantly different with one another, and that most of the specific <i>lin</i> genes are located on multiple sphingomonad-unique plasmids. Copies of IS<i>6100</i>, the most abundant insertion sequence in the four strains, are often located in close proximity to the specific <i>lin</i> genes. Analysis of the footprints of target duplication upon IS<i>6100</i> transposition and the experimental detection of IS<i>6100</i> transposition strongly suggested that the IS<i>6100</i> transposition has caused dynamic genome rearrangements and the diversification of <i>lin</i>-flanking regions in the four strains.</p>

The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Community trends of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (≥55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF).

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ing women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the project during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ing coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes. Improvements in treatment times corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%–2.3%; <i>P</i>=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the project during the same time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in time to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality.

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering With Evolocumab and Outcomes in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events in the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk). We investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at baseline if they had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. An additional outcome of interest was major adverse limb events defined as acute limb ischemia, major amputation, or urgent peripheral revascularization for ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Three thousand six hundred forty-two patients (13.2%) had PAD (1505 with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke). Evolocumab significantly reduced the primary end point consistently in patients with PAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.0098) and without PAD (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; <i>P</i>=0.0003; <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.40). For the key secondary end point, the HRs were 0.73 (0.59–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.0040) for those with PAD and 0.81 (0.73–0.90; <i>P</i><0.0001) for those without PAD (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.41). Because of their higher risk, patients with PAD had larger absolute risk reductions for the primary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.6% without PAD) and the key secondary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.4% without PAD). Evolocumab reduced the risk of major adverse limb events in all patients (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.88; <i>P</i>=0.0093) with consistent effects in those with and without known PAD. There was a consistent relationship between lower achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower risk of limb events (<i>P</i>=0.026 for the beta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent) that extended down to <10 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with PAD are at high risk of cardiovascular events, and PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab significantly reduced that risk with large absolute risk reductions.

NMDA-Type Glutamate Receptor Activation Promotes Vascular Remodeling and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive proliferation and apoptosis resistance in pulmonary vascular cells underlie vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Specific treatments for PAH exist, mostly targeting endothelial dysfunction, but high pulmonary arterial pressure still causes heart failure and death. Pulmonary vascular remodeling may be driven by metabolic reprogramming of vascular cells to increase glutaminolysis and glutamate production. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a major neuronal glutamate receptor, is also expressed on vascular cells, but its role in PAH is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the status of the glutamate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and controls through mass spectrometry imaging, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We measured the glutamate release from cultured pulmonary vascular cells using enzymatic assays and analyzed NMDAR regulation/phosphorylation through Western blot experiments. The effect of NMDAR blockade on human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation was determined using a BrdU incorporation assay. We assessed the role of NMDARs in vascular remodeling associated to pulmonary hypertension, in both smooth muscle-specific NMDAR knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia and the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension using NMDAR blockers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report glutamate accumulation, upregulation of the NMDAR, and NMDAR engagement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed by increases in GluN1-subunit phosphorylation in the pulmonary arteries of human patients with PAH. K<sub>v</sub> channel inhibition and type A-selective endothelin receptor activation amplified calcium-dependent glutamate release from human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell, and type A-selective endothelin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation led to NMDAR engagement, highlighting crosstalk between the glutamate-NMDAR axis and major PAH-associated pathways. The platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced proliferation of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells involved NMDAR activation and phosphorylated GluN1 subunit localization to cell-cell contacts, consistent with glutamatergic communication between proliferating human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells via NMDARs. Smooth-muscle NMDAR deficiency in mice attenuated the vascular remodeling triggered by chronic hypoxia, highlighting the role of vascular NMDARs in pulmonary hypertension. Pharmacological NMDAR blockade in the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension had beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular remodeling, decreasing endothelial dysfunction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis resistance while disrupting the glutamate-NMDAR pathway in pulmonary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal a dysregulation of the glutamate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and identify vascular NMDARs as targets for antiremodeling treatments in PAH.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Functions Underestimate Risk in HIV Infection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is elevated in HIV-infected individuals, with contributions from both traditional and nontraditional risk factors. The accuracy of established CVD risk prediction functions in HIV is uncertain. We sought to assess the performance of 3 established CVD risk prediction functions in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The FHS (Framingham Heart Study) functions for hard coronary heart disease (FHS CHD) and atherosclerotic CVD (FHS ASCVD) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD function were applied to the Partners HIV cohort. Risk scores were calculated between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Outcomes included CHD (myocardial infarction or coronary death) for the FHS CHD function and ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary death) for the FHS ASCVD and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD functions. We investigated the accuracy of CVD risk prediction for each function when applied to the HIV cohort using comparison of Cox regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ents, discrimination, and calibration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The HIV cohort was comprised of 1272 men followed for a median of 4.4 years.

Discrimination was moderate to poor as indicated by the low <i>c</i> statistic (0.68 for FHS CHD, 0.65 for American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD, and 0.67 for FHS ASCVD). Observed CVD risk exceeded the predicted risk for each of the functions in most deciles of predicted risk. Calibration, or goodness of fit of the models, was consistently poor, with significant χ<sup>2</sup> <i>P</i> values for all functions. Recalibration did not significantly improve model fit.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cardiovascular risk prediction functions developed for use in the general population are inaccurate in HIV infection and systematically underestimate risk in a cohort of HIV-infected men.

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

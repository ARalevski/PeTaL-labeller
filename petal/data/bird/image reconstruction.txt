Reconstruction of the hip after resection of periacetabular oncological lesions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion of the acetabulum after resection of a periacetabular   malignancy is technically challenging and many different techniques   have been used with varying success. Our aim was to prepare a systematic   review of the literature dealing with these techniques in order   to clarify the management, the rate of complications and the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted for English language   articles published between January 1990 and February 2017 with combinations   of key search terms to identify studies dealing with periacetabular   resection with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion in patients with a malignancy. Studies   in English that reported radiographic or clinical outcomes were   included. Data collected from each study included: the number and   type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions, the pathological diagnosis of the lesions,   the mean age and follow-up, gender distribution, implant survivorship, complications,   functional outcome, and mortality. The results from individual studies   were combined for the general analysis, and then grouped according   to the type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 57 studies met the inclusion criteria and included   1700 patients. Most lesions were metastatic (41%), followed by chondrosarcoma   (29%), osteosarcoma (10%), Ewing’s sarcoma (7%), and multiple myeloma   (2%). The techniques of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion were divided into seven types   for analysis: those involving a Harrington <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion, a saddle   prosthesis, an allograft and allograft prosthesis composite, a pasteurised   autograft, a porous tantalum implant, a custom-made prosthesis and   a modular hemipelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion. The rate of complications was   50%, with infection (14%) and instability (8%) being the most common.   Mortality data were available for 1427 patients (84%); 50% had died   of disease progression, 23% were alive with disease, and 27% had no   evidence of disease at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (0 to 34). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the rate of complications and mortality are high following   resection of oncological periacetabular lesions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion.   Many types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion have been used with unique challenges   and complications for each technique.

Resection of the ilium in patients with a sarcoma
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to investigate the controversial issue   of whether the pelvic ring should be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed following resection   of the sarcomas of the ilium.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From our database, we identified 64 patients who underwent excision   of a tumour involving the ilium between 1976 and 2015. A total of   35 underwent complete resection, of whom 24 were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed with   a non-vascularised fibula graft, and four with extracorporeal irradiation   and reimplantation. A total of 29 patients had a partial resection.   The mean follow-up was 9.2 years (1.1 to 25.6).

The mean   TESS for those who underwent total resection with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion   was 72.0% (17% to 100%) and without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion it was 53.3%   (20% to 90%) and for those who underwent partial resection it was   76.3% (31.3% to 100%). The rate of local recurrence was 42.2% and   this was more common in those treated by partial resection (p =   0.048). The risk of local recurrence was related to the margin achieved   at resection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Given the high rate of local recurrence following excision of   a tumour from the ilium, obtaining wide surgical margins should   be a priority even if this requires more aggressive surgery. In   young patients, where late recurrence may occur, more radical complete   resection should be considered. When total resection of the ilium   is considered, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion should also be considered as it confers   a higher functional outcome than total resection without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:538–43.</p></sec>

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in skeletally immature patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Different methods of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion   have been described for skeletally immature patients before closure   of the growth plates. However, the outcome and complications following   this treatment remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review   was to analyse the outcome and complications of different techniques   which may be used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion of the ACL in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the literature according   to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines. This involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline,   CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase and Google Scholar databases using the   following combinations of keywords, “knee”, “anterior cruciate ligament”,   “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion”, “injury”, “children”, “adolescent”, “skeletally   immature”, “open physis” and “surgery”.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 53 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included   for analysis. The overall rate of disturbance of growth after ACL   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion was 2.6%, with no statistical difference between   transphyseal and physeal-sparing techniques. Physeal-sparing techniques   had a lower rate of post-operative complications compared with transphyseal techniques   (p = 0.0045). Outcomes assessed were Lysholm score, International   Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the IKDC grade, the Tegner   score and the KT-1000. Both techniques had similar clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This review reveals low rates of disturbance of growth after   ACL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion in skeletally immature patients. Although limited,   the available evidence did not support any particular surgical technique   when considering disturbance of growth or clinical outcome.

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions   were manually created. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This information can be used in the surgical planning   and operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a fracture of the proximal humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

Is there still a role for osteoarticular allograft reconstruction in musculoskeletal tumour surgery?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess complications and failure mechanisms of osteoarticular   allograft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions for primary bone tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 38 patients (28 men, 74%) who were   treated at our institution with osteoarticular allograft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion   between 1989 and 2010. Median age was 19 years (interquartile range   14 to 32). Median follow-up was 19.5 years (95% confidence interval   (CI) 13.0 to 26.1) when 26 patients (68%) were alive. In addition, we   systematically searched the literature for clinical studies on osteoarticular   allografts, finding 31 studies suitable for analysis. Results of   papers that reported on one site exclusively were pooled for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 patients (53%) experienced graft failure, including   15 due to mechanical complications (39%) and three (9%) due to infection.   In the systematic review, 514 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions were analysed (distal   femur, n = 184, 36%; proximal tibia, n = 136, 26%; distal radius,   n = 99, 19%; proximal humerus, n = 95, 18%). Overall rates of failure, fracture   and infection were 27%, 20%, and 10% respectively. With the distal   femur as the reference, fractures were more common in the humerus   (odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.7) and tibia (OR 2.2, 95%   CI 1.3 to 4.4); infections occurred more often in the tibia (OR   2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.4) and less often in the radius (OR 0.1, 95%   CI 0.0 to 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Osteoarticular allograft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions are associated with   high rates of mechanical complications.

Staged lengthening and reconstruction for children with a leg-length discrepancy after excision of an osteosarcoma around the knee
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Children treated for osteosarcoma around the knee often have   a substantial leg-length discrepancy at skeletal maturity. The aim   of this study was to investigate the results of staged skeletal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion after a leg lengthening procedure using an external   fixator in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 11 patients who underwent staged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion with   either an arthroplasty (n = 6) or an arthrodesis (n = 5). A control   group of 11 patients who had undergone wide excision and concurrent   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion with an arthroplasty were matched for gender, location,   and size of tumour.

The long-term clinical and radiological outcomes in patients who suffer recurrent injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament after reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical   and radiological outcome of patients who suffer recurrent injuries   to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion and   require revision surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From a consecutive series of 200 patients who underwent primary   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion following rupture of the ACL, we identified 36 who   sustained a further rupture, 29 of whom underwent revision surgery.   Patients were reviewed prospectively at one, two, seven, 15 and   about 20 years after their original surgery. Primary outcome measures   were the number of further ruptures, the posterior tibial slope   (PTS), and functional and radiological outcomes.

Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis
<p>During embryogenesis, cells acquire distinct fates by transitioning through transcriptional states. To uncover these transcriptional trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed URD, a simulated diffusion-based computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion method. URD identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short reads from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides reliable allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of selection signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of selection targets, we propose a new approach that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>s selected haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify selected haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that selected haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a selected haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Fast, Accurate and Automatic Ancient Nucleosome and Methylation Maps with epiPALEOMIX
<p>The first epigenomes from archaic hominins (AH) and ancient anatomically modern humans (AMH) have recently been characterized, based, however, on a limited number of samples. The extent to which ancient genome-wide epigenetic landscapes can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed thus remains contentious. Here, we present epiPALEOMIX, an open-source and user-friendly pipeline that exploits post-mortem DNA degradation patterns to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> ancient methylomes and nucleosome maps from shotgun and/or capture-enrichment data. Applying epiPALEOMIX to the sequence data underlying 35 ancient genomes including AMH, AH, equids and aurochs, we investigate the temporal, geographical and preservation range of ancient epigenetic signatures. We first assess the quality of inferred ancient epigenetic signatures within well-characterized genomic regions. We find that tissue-specific methylation signatures can be obtained across a wider range of DNA preparation types than previously thought, including when no particular experimental procedures have been used to remove deaminated cytosines prior to sequencing. We identify a large subset of samples for which DNA associated with nucleosomes is protected from post-mortem degradation, and nucleosome positioning patterns can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed. Finally, we describe parameters and conditions such as DNA damage levels and sequencing depth that limit the preservation of epigenetic signatures in ancient samples. When such conditions are met, we propose that epigenetic profiles of CTCF binding regions can be used to help data authentication. Our work, including epiPALEOMIX, opens for further investigations of ancient epigenomes through time especially aimed at tracking possible epigenetic changes during major evolutionary, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural shifts.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion.</p>

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia.

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes. By contrast, typical synthetic materials cannot grow and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> their structures once formed. We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” polymeric materials that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the materials are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel materials for applications such as soft robots and intelligent devices.</p>

Quantum metasurface for multiphoton interference and state reconstruction
<p>Metasurfaces based on resonant nanophotonic structures have enabled innovative types of flat-optics devices that often outperform the capabilities of bulk components, yet these advances remain largely unexplored for quantum applications. We show that nonclassical multiphoton interferences can be achieved at the subwavelength scale in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion of amplitude, phase, coherence, and entanglement of multiphoton polarization-encoded states. One- and two-photon states are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed through nonlocal photon correlation measurements with polarization-insensitive click detectors positioned after the metasurface, and the scalability to higher photon numbers is established theoretically. Our work illustrates the feasibility of ultrathin quantum metadevices for the manipulation and measurement of multiphoton quantum states, with applications in free-space quantum imaging and communications.</p>

Ghost cytometry
<p>Ghost imaging is a technique used to produce an object’s image without using a spatially resolving detector. Here we develop a technique we term “ghost cytometry,” an image-free ultrafast fluorescence “imaging” cytometry based on a single-pixel detector. Spatial information obtained from the motion of cells relative to a static randomly patterned optical structure is compressively converted into signals that arrive sequentially at a single-pixel detector. Combinatorial use of the temporal waveform with the intensity distribution of the random pattern allows us to computationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> cell morphology. More importantly, we show that applying machine-learning methods directly on the compressed waveforms without image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion enables efficient image-free morphology-based cytometry. Despite a compact and inexpensive instrumentation, image-free ghost cytometry achieves accurate and high-throughput cell classification and selective sorting on the basis of cell morphology without a specific biomarker, both of which have been challenging to accomplish using conventional flow cytometers.</p>

Cell type atlas and lineage tree of a whole complex animal by single-cell transcriptomics
<p>Flatworms of the species <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> are immortal—adult animals contain a large pool of pluripotent stem cells that continuously differentiate into all adult cell types.

Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation
<p>The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earth’s history when global mean sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions of LIG global temperature remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2°C warmer than present-day temperatures. Here we use a network of sea-surface temperature (SST) records to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global mean annual SSTs were 0.5 ± 0.3°C warmer than the climatological mean from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 mean. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 mean in response to reduced mean annual insolation.</p>

Climate change: The 2015 Paris Agreement thresholds and Mediterranean basin ecosystems

In the Mediterranean basin, recent pollen-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions of climate and ecosystem variability over the past 10,000 years provide insights regarding the implications of warming thresholds for biodiversity and land-use potential.

Only a 1.5°C warming scenario permits ecosystems to remain within the Holocene variability. At or above 2°C of warming, climatic change will generate Mediterranean land ecosystem changes that are unmatched in the Holocene, a period characterized by recurring precipitation deficits rather than temperature anomalies.</p>

<p>The history of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) is inextricably linked to the coevolution of life and Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions of past <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> rely on models and proxies but often markedly disagree. We present a record of <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed using O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> ratios from ancient air trapped in ice. This record indicates that <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> declined by 7 per mil (0.7%) over the past 800,000 years, requiring that O<sub>2</sub> sinks were ~2% larger than sources. This decline is consistent with changes in burial and weathering fluxes of organic carbon and pyrite driven by either Neogene cooling or increasing Pleistocene erosion rates. The 800,000-year record of steady average carbon dioxide partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub>) but declining <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> provides distinctive evidence that a silicate weathering feedback stabilizes <i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> on million-year time scales.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) genome has recently become available, and analysis of this genome reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian genome in comparison with other well-characterized genomes. We found that durian and cotton were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in cotton ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in cotton genes due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant genomes. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of cotton genes by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate gene evolutionary rates, likely due to its long generation time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed phylogenetic trees of homologous genes being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of genomes and genes, and they suggest revisiting existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed phylogenetic trees.</p>

Illuminating the Base of the Annelid Tree Using Transcriptomics
<p>Annelida is one of three animal groups possessing segmentation and is central in considerations about the evolution of different character traits. It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750–170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and deposit feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and filter feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or grooved palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia bearing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.</p>

A protocol and calibration method for accurate multi-camera field videography
<p>Stereo videography is a powerful technique for quantifying the kinematics and behavior of animals, but it can be challenging to use in an outdoor field setting. We here present a workflow and associated software for performing calibration of cameras placed in a field setting and estimating the accuracy of the resulting stereoscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions. We demonstrate the workflow through example stereoscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ions of bat and bird flight. We provide software tools for planning experiments and processing the resulting calibrations that other researchers may use to calibrate their own cameras. Our field protocol can be deployed in a single afternoon, requiring only short video clips of light, portable calibration objects.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the pelvis are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of pelvic chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing risk model, our objective   was to identify risk factors for the development of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the pelvis were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 years (one week to 23.1 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died. Overall survival was 76%, 55% and 45% at one, five and   ten years post-operatively, respectively. In a competing risk model   the cumulative risk of the development of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one year, post-operatively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion was a significant risk factor for   the development of complications (p = 0.006). Complications were   not significantly related to age or the location or grade of the   tumour (p = 0.823, p = 0.976, p = 0.858).

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake revision total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless hemispherical acetabular components and metal   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion cage and a porous   metal augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular revisions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion cage and porous metal augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the mean follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The mean number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3).

The stability of the hip after the use of a proximal femoral endoprosthesis for oncological indications
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Instability of the hip is the most common mode of failure after   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion with a proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) using   an endoprosthesis after excision of a tumour. Small studies report   improved stability with capsular repair of the hip and other techniques,   but these have not been investigated in a large series of patients.   The aim of this study was to evaluate variables associated with   the patient and the operation that affect post-operative stability.   We hypothesised an association between capsular repair and stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 527 adult patients   who were treated with a PFA for tumours. Our data included demographics,   the pathological diagnosis, the amount of resection of the abductor   muscles, the techniques of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion and the characteristics   of the implant. We used regression analysis to compare patients   with and without post-operative instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 patients out of 527 (4%) had instability which   presented at a mean of 35 days (3 to 131) post-operatively. Capsular   repair was not associated with a reduced rate of instability. Bivariate   analysis showed that a posterolateral surgical approach (odds ratio   (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) and the type   of implant (p = 0.046) had a significant association with reduced   instability; age > 60 years predicted instability (OR 3.17, 95%   CI 1.00 to 9.98). Multivariate analysis showed age > 60 years (OR   5.09, 95% CI 1.23 to 21.07), female gender (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04   to 2.89), a malignant primary bone tumour (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.06   to 3.95), and benign condition (OR 5.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 22.90),   but not metastatic disease or soft-tissue tumours, predicted instability,   while a posterolateral approach (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.53) was   protective against instability. No instability occurred when a synthetic   graft was used in 70 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Stability of the hip after PFA is influenced by variables associated   with the patient, the pathology, the surgical technique and the   implant. We did not find an association between capsular repair   and improved stability. Extension of the tumour often dictates surgical   technique; however, our results indicate that PFA using a posterolateral   approach with a hemiarthroplasty and synthetic augment for soft-tissue   repair confers the lowest risk of instability. Patients who are   elderly, female, or with a primary benign or malignant bone tumour   should be counselled about an increased risk of instability.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:531–7.</p></sec>

Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with heart failure after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has not been examined in a contemporary clinical trial of surgical revascularization.

We excluded patients with prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and those randomized only to medical therapy. The primary outcome was SCD as adjudicated by a blinded committee. A Cox model was used to examine and identify predictors of SCD. The Fine and Gray method was used to estimate the incidence of SCD accounting for the competing risk of other deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over a median follow-up of 46 months, 113 of 1411 patients who received CABG without (n = 934) or with (n = 477) surgical ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion had SCD; 311 died of other causes. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction at enrollment was 28±9%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of SCD was 8.5%. Patients who had SCD and those who did not die were younger and had fewer comorbid conditions than did those who died of causes other than SCD. In the first 30 days after CABG, SCD (n=5) accounted for 7% of all deaths. The numerically greatest monthly rate of SCD was in the 31- to 90-day time period. In a multivariable analysis including baseline demographics, risk factors, coronary anatomy, and left ventricular function, end-systolic volume index and B-type natriuretic peptide were most strongly associated with SCD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The monthly risk of SCD shortly after CABG among patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction is highest between the first and third months, suggesting that risk stratification for SCD should occur early in the postoperative period, particularly in patients with increased preoperative end-systolic volume index or B-type natriuretic peptide.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees. The software is available from <ext-link>www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcs</ext-link>.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

There were 30 re-operations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-operative years.   Painful loosening was the primary indication for removal in 14 patients.   Short-stemmed prostheses (16 mm to 22 mm in length) were also associated   with an increased risk of painful loosening (odds ratio 3.54 (1.02   to 12.2), p = 0.045). Radiocapitellar instability was the primary   indication for re-operation with retention of the implant (5). The   overall survival of the RHA, free from re-operation, was 60.8% (<sc>sd</sc> 5.7%)   at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bipolar and press-fit RHA gives unsatisfactory mid-term outcomes   in the treatment of acute fractures of the radial head or their   sequelae. The outcome may vary according to the design of the implant.   The rate of re-operation during the first three years is predictive   of the long-term survival in tight-fitting RHAs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B1197–1203.</p></sec>

Revision anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ligaments of the ankle augmented with suture tape for patients with a failed Broström procedure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the intermediate-term   outcomes after revision anatomical ankle ligament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion   augmented with suture tape for a failed modified Broström procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 30 patients with persistent instability of the ankle   after a Broström procedure underwent revision augmented with suture   tape. Of these, 24 patients who were followed up for more than two   years were included in the study. There were 13 men and 11 women.   Their mean age was 31.8 years (23 to 44). The mean follow-up was 38.5   months (24 to 56) The clinical outcome was assessed using the Foot   and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure   (FAAM) score. The stability of the ankle was assessed using stress   radiographs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean FAOS and FAAM scores improved significantly to 87.5   (73 to 94) and 85.1 (70 to 95) points at final follow-up, respectively   (p < 0.001). The mean angle of talar tilt and anterior talar   translation improved significantly to 2.8° (0° to 6°) and 4.1 mm   (2 to 7) at final follow-up, respectively (p < 0.001). Side to   side comparison in stress radiographs at final follow-up showed   no significant difference. The revision failed in one patient who   underwent a further revision using allograft tendon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The revision modified Broström procedure augmented with suture   tape is an effective form of treatment for recurrent instability   of the ankle following a failed Broström procedure. This technique   provides reliable stability and satisfactory clinical outcomes at   intermediate-term follow-up.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1183–9</p></sec>

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery. This laboratory   study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic antibacterial   properties against planktonic bacteria, or the ability to inhibit   biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components   were sterilised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either <i>Staphylococcus   (S.) aureus</i> or <i>S. epidermidis</i> for 24 hours.   After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified   on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. In order to establish whether biofilms   formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these   Ta and Ti pieces were then washed twice, sonicated and washed again   to remove loosely adhered planktonic bacteria. They were then re-incubated   for 24 hours prior to quantifying the number of cfu. All experiments   were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>More than 1x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml were observed in both the Ta   and Ti experiments. After washing and sonication, more than 2x10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml   were observed for both Ta and Ti groups. The results were the same   for both <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with Ti controls, Ta did not demonstrate any intrinsic   antibacterial activity or ability to inhibit biofilm formation.   Hence, intrinsic antimicrobial properties of Ta do not account for   the previously observed reduction in the frequency of subsequent   infections when Ta was used in revision procedures. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1153–6.</p></sec>

The evolution of an uncemented acetabular component in alumina-on-alumina total hip arthroplasty has improved clinical outcome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the effect of a change in design of a cementless   ceramic acetabular component in fixation and clinical outcome after   total hip arthroplasty</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We compared 342 hips (302 patients) operated between 1999 and   2005 with a relatively smooth hydroxyapatite coated acetabular component   (group 1), and 337 hips (310 patients) operated between 2006 and   2011 using a similar acetabular component with a macrotexture on   the entire outer surface of the component (group 2). The mean age of   the patients was 53.5 (14 to 70) in group 1 and 53.0 (15 to 70)   in group 2. The mean follow-up was 12.7 years (10 to 17) for group   1 and 7.2 years (4 to 10) for group 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No hips were revised due to complications related to bearing   fracture or to stem loosening. A total of 15 acetabular components   were revised for aseptic loosening in group 1 and two in group 2.   The survival rate for acetabular component aseptic loosening at   eight years was 96.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.8 to 98.7)   for group 1 and 99.2% (95% CI 98.0 to 100) for group 2. The risk   for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component was higher in group   1 (p = 0.04, Hazard Ratio (HR) 4.99), dysplastic acetabula (p =   0.01, HR 4.12), components outside Lewinnek's zone (p < 0.001,   HR 6.13) and in those with a hip rotation centre distance greater   than 5 mm (p = 0.005, HR 4.09). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Alumina ceramic-on-ceramic THA is an excellent option for young   patients. Although newer components appeared to improve fixation,   acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion is essential to obtain a satisfactory   outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:749–58.</p></sec>

Deetiolation Enhances Phototropism by Modulating NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL3 Phosphorylation Status
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in (phot) receptor kinases play important roles in promoting plant growth by controlling light-capturing processes, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is mediated through the action of NON-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>IC HYPOCOTYL3 (NPH3), which is dephosphorylated following phot activation. However, the functional significance of this early signaling event remains unclear. Here, we show that the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in dark-grown (etiolated) seedlings of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is enhanced by greening (deetiolation). Red and blue light were equally effective in promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in Arabidopsis, consistent with our observations that deetiolation by phytochrome or cryptochrome was sufficient to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Increased responsiveness did not result from an enhanced sensitivity to the phytohormone auxin, nor does it involve the phot-interacting protein, ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ISM2. Instead, deetiolated seedlings showed attenuated levels of NPH3 dephosphorylation and diminished relocalization of NPH3 from the plasma membrane during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Likewise, etiolated seedlings that lack the PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 displayed reduced NPH3 dephosphorylation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism, consistent with their constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in darkness. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ic enhancement could also be achieved in etiolated seedlings by lowering the light intensity to diminish NPH3 dephosphorylation. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is enhanced following deetiolation through the modulation of a phosphorylation rheostat, which in turn sustains the activity of NPH3. We propose that this dynamic mode of regulation enables young seedlings to maximize their establishment under changing light conditions, depending on their photoautotrophic capacity.</p>

Observation of a large-scale anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 8 × 10<sup>18</sup> eV
<p>Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei arriving from outer space that reach the highest energies observed in nature. Clues to their origin come from studying the distribution of their arrival directions. Using 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> cosmic rays with energies above 8 × 10<sup>18</sup> electron volts, recorded with the Pierre Auger Observatory from a total exposure of 76,800 km<sup>2</sup> sr year, we determined the existence of anisotropy in arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected at more than a 5.2σ level of significance, can be described by a dipole with an amplitude of [Formula] percent toward right ascension α<sub>d</sub> = 100 ± 10 degrees and declination δ<sub>d</sub> = [Formula] degrees<i>.</i> That direction indicates an extragalactic origin for these ultrahigh-energy particles.</p>

Nanocrystalline copper films are never flat
<p>We used scanning tunneling microscopy to study low-angle grain boundaries at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films. The presence of grain boundaries and their emergence at the film surface create valleys composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that valleys and ridges were created by an out-of-plane grain rotation driven by reduction of grain boundary energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-crystal metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-crystal metals are usually synthesized by bulk crystal growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-crystal metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong spin-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

Unequivocal determination of complex molecular structures using anisotropic NMR measurements
<p>Assignment of complex molecular structures from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data can be prone to interpretational mistakes. Residual dipolar couplings and residual chemical shift anisotropy provide a spatial view of the relative orientations between bonds and chemical shielding tensors, respectively, regardless of separation. Consequently, these data constitute a reliable reporter of global structural validity. Anisotropic NMR parameters can be used to evaluate investigators’ structure proposals or structures generated by computer-assisted structure elucidation. Application of the method to several complex structure assignment problems shows promising results that signal a potential paradigm shift from conventional NMR data interpretation, which may be of particular utility for compounds not amenable to x-ray crystallography.</p>

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns
<p>Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and topology of active matter.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule arrays form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical array patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy defects in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule array patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant defect in the timing of transitions between array patterns but no substantive defect in the array patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule array architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between array patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate array transitions.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in, which also regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf photosynthesis and biomass production.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses six <i>LAZY</i> genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in roots and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to root and shoot branch angles and gravitropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary roots. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the gravitropism mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral root branch angle. Lateral roots of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary root axis, and they were agravitropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially agravitropic, but their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the root of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also agravitropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed gravitropic response. A reversed auxin gradient across the root visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of auxin gradients that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced auxin gradient.</p>

Microstructural Impact of Ischemia and Bone Marrow–Derived Cell Therapy Revealed With Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tractography of the Heart In Vivo
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The arrangement of myofibers in the heart is highly complex and must be replicated by injected cells to produce functional myocardium. A novel approach to characterize the microstructural response of the myocardium to ischemia and cell therapy, with the use of serial diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography of the heart in vivo, is presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Validation of the approach was performed in normal (n=6) and infarcted mice (n=6) as well as healthy human volunteers. Mice (n=12) were then injected with bone marrow mononuclear cells 3 weeks after coronary ligation. In half of the mice the donor and recipient strains were identical, and in half the strains were different. A positive response to cell injection was defined by a decrease in mean diffusivity, an increase in fractional anisotropy, and the appearance of new myofiber tracts with the correct orientation. A positive response to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was seen in 1 mouse. The response of the majority of mice to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was neutral (9/12) or negative (2/12). The in vivo tractography findings were confirmed with histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography was able to directly resolve the ability of injected cells to generate new myofiber tracts and provided a fundamental readout of their regenerative capacity. A highly novel and translatable approach to assess the efficacy of cell therapy in the heart is thus presented.</p></sec>

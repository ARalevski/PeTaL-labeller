Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Fractional Flow Reserve–Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome compared with medical therapy (MT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but PCI was guided by angiography alone. FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) compared PCI guided by fractional flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e with best MT in patients with stable coronary artery disease to assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 888 patients with stable single-vessel or multivessel coronary artery disease with reduced fractional flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e were randomly assigned to PCI plus MT (n=447) or MT alone (n=441). Major adverse cardiac events included death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Costs were calculated on the basis of resource use and Medicare reimbursement rates. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years were assessed with utilities determined by the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions health survey at baseline and over follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Major adverse cardiac events at 3 years were significantly lower in the PCI group compared with the MT group (10.1% versus 22.0%; <i>P</i><0.001), primarily as a result of a lower rate of urgent revascularization (4.3% versus 17.2%; <i>P</i><0.001). Death and myocardial infarction were numerically lower in the PCI group (8.3% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.28). Angina was significantly less severe in the PCI group at all follow-up points to 3 years. Mean initial costs were higher in the PCI group ($9944 versus $4440; <i>P</i><0.001) but by 3 years were similar between the 2 groups ($16 792 versus $16 737; <i>P</i>=0.94). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCI compared with MT was $17 300 per quality-adjusted life-year at 2 years and $1600 per quality-adjusted life-year at 3 years. The above findings were robust in sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>ConclusionS:</title><p>PCI of lesions with reduced fractional flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e improves long-term outcome and is economically attractive compared with MT alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); control RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with control, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with controls, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between control and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between control, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Efficient cortical coding of 3D posture in freely behaving rats
<p>Animals constantly update their body posture to meet behavioral demands, but little is known about the neural signals on which this depends. We therefore tracked freely foraging rats in three dimensions while recording from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the frontal motor cortex (M2), areas critical for movement planning and navigation. Both regions showed strong tuning to posture of the head, neck, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>, but signals for movement were much less dominant. Head and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> representations were organized topographically across the PPC and M2, and more neurons represented postures that occurred less often. Simultaneous recordings across areas were sufficiently robust to decode ongoing behavior and showed that spiking in the PPC tended to precede that in M2. Both the PPC and M2 strongly represent posture by using a spatially organized, energetically efficient population code.</p>

A synthetic polymer system with repeatable chemical recyclability
<p>The development of chemically recyclable polymers offers a solution to the end-of-use issue of polymeric materials and provides a closed-loop approach toward a circular materials economy. However, polymers that can be easily and selectively depolymerized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to monomers typically require low-temperature polymerization methods and also lack physical properties and mechanical strengths required for practical uses. We introduce a polymer system based on γ-butyrolactone (GBL) with a trans-ring fusion at the α and β positions. Such trans-ring fusion renders the commonly considered as nonpolymerizable GBL ring readily polymerizable at room temperature under solvent-free conditions to yield a high–molecular weight polymer. The polymer has enhanced thermostability and can be repeatedly and quantitatively recycled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to its monomer by thermolysis or chemolysis. Mixing of the two enantiomers of the polymer generates a highly crystalline supramolecular stereocomplex.</p>

Ontogenetic expression of metabolic genes and microRNAs in rainbow trout alevins during the transition from the endogenous to the exogenous feeding period
<p>As oviparous fish, rainbow trout change their nutritional strategy during ontogenesis. This change is divided into the exclusive utilization of yolk-sac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es (endogenous feeding), the concurrent utilization of yolk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The change in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological changes, including the development of adipose tissue as an energy storage site, and continuous muscle development to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic changes between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow trout alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of marker genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or maintenance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (<i>g6pca</i> and <i>g6pcb</i>) and lipolytic gene expression (<i>cpt1a</i> and <i>cpt1b</i>) decreased, while that of <i>gk</i>, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the utilization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a utilization of exogenous feeds <i>via</i> the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the utilization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of <i>omy-miRNA-143</i>, a homologue of the mammalian marker of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene <i>abhd5</i>, a factor in triglyceride hydrolysis, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid deposition. Muscle-specific <i>omy-miRNA-1/133</i> and <i>myod1</i> expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with muscle hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging.</p>

The evolution of fracture clinic design
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fracture clinics are often characterised by the referral of large   numbers of unselected patients with minor injuries not requiring   investigation or intervention, long waiting times and recurrent   unnecessary reviews. Our experience had been of an unsustainable   system and we implemented a ‘Trauma Triage Clinic’ (TTC) in order   to rationalise and regulate access to our fracture service. The   British Orthopaedic Association’s guidelines have required a prospective evaluation   of this change of practice, and we report our experience and results.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We review the management of all 12 069 patients referred to our   service in the calendar year 2014, with a minimum of one year follow-up   during the calendar year 2015. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following the successful introduction of the TTC, only 2836 patients   (23.5%) who would previously have been reviewed in the general fracture   clinic were brought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to such a clinic to be seen by a surgeon.   An additional 2366 patients (19.6%) were brought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to a sub-specialist   injury-specific clinic.

Angiography Versus Hemodynamics to Predict the Natural History of Coronary Stenoses
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with documented stable coronary artery disease and in whom no revascularization was performed, we compared the respective values of angiographic diameter stenosis (DS) and fractional flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e (FFR) in predicting natural history.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The present analysis included the 607 patients from the FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e Versus Angiography in Multivessel Evaluation 2) in whom no revascularization was performed. FFR varied from 0.20 to 1.00 (average 0.74±0.16), and DS (by quantitative coronary analysis) varied from 8% to 98% (average 53±15). The primary end point, defined as vessel-oriented clinical end point (VOCE) at 2 years, was a composite of prospectively adjudicated cardiac death, vessel-related myocardial infarction, vessel-related urgent, and not urgent revascularization. The stenoses were divided into 4 groups according to FFR and %DS values: positive concordance (FFR≤0.80; DS≥50%), negative concordance (FFR>0.80; DS<50%), positive mismatch (FFR≤0.80; DS<50%), and negative mismatch (FFR>0.80; DS≥50%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of VOCE was highest in the positive concordance group (log rank: X<sup>2</sup>=80.96; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lowest in the negative concordance group.

Fractional Flow Reserve and Cardiac Events in Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We evaluated the prognosis of deferred and revascularized coronary stenoses after fractional flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e (FFR) measurement to assess its revascularization threshold in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The IRIS-FFR registry (Interventional Cardiology Research In-cooperation Society Fractional Flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e) prospectively enrolled 5846 patients with ≥1coronary lesion with FFR measurement. Revascularization was deferred in 6468 lesions and performed in 2165 lesions after FFR assessment. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) at a median follow-up of 1.9 years and analyzed on a per-lesion basis. A marginal Cox model accounted for correlated data in patients with multiple lesions, and a model to predict per-lesion outcomes was adjusted for confounding factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>For deferred lesions, the risk of major adverse cardiac events demonstrated a significant, inverse relationship with FFR (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.08; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not observed in revascularized lesions (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.70). For lesions with FFR ≥0.76, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was not significantly different between deferred and revascularized lesions. Conversely, in lesions with FFR ≤0.75, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was significantly lower in revascularized lesions than in deferred lesions (for FFR 0.71–0.75, adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.021; for FFR ≤0.70, adjusted hazard ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.84; <i>P</i>=0.012).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This large, prospective registry showed that the FFR value was linearly associated with the risk of cardiac events in deferred lesions. In addition, revascularization for coronary artery stenosis with a low FFR (≤0.75) was associated with better outcomes than the deferral, whereas for a stenosis with a high FFR (≥0.76), medical treatment would be a reasonable and safe treatment strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

<p>The World Health Organization recently announced that the Zika epidemic is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, a designation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ed for acute threats that Zika received in February. But the decision only means that Zika has evolved from an emergency to another long-term public health challenge. The Zika virus is now firmly entrenched in Latin America, which is already battling several other mosquito-borne diseases. Meanwhile, Zika vaccines aren't available yet, and fundamental gaps remain in scientists' knowledge of the virus and the risk of microcephaly and other birth defects that it poses. Perhaps the biggest question is also the most difficult to answer: Why have the effects of Zika been so pronounced in northeastern Brazil?</p>

A disynaptic feedback network activated by experience promotes the integration of new granule cells
<p>Experience shapes the development and connectivity of adult-born granule cells (GCs) through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We examined the remodeling of dentate gyrus microcircuits in mice in an enriched environment (EE). Short exposure to EE during early development of new GCs accelerated their functional integration. This effect was mimicked by in vivo chemogenetic activation of a limited population of mature GCs. Slice recordings showed that mature GCs recruit parvalbumin γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing interneurons (PV-INs) that feed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> onto developing GCs. Accordingly, chemogenetic stimulation of PV-INs or direct depolarization of developing GCs accelerated GC integration, whereas inactivation of PV-INs prevented the effects of EE. Our results reveal a mechanism for dynamic remodeling in which experience activates dentate networks that “prime” young GCs through a disynaptic feed<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> loop mediated by PV-INs.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers
<p>Organometal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and water.

The luminescent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard illumination.

The Vertebral Column of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>Two partial vertebral columns of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i> grant insight into aspects of early hominin spinal mobility, lumbar curvature, vertebral formula, and transitional vertebra position. <i>Au. sediba</i> likely possessed five non–rib-bearing lumbar vertebrae and five sacral elements, the same configuration that occurs modally in modern humans. This finding contrasts with other interpretations of early hominin regional vertebral numbers. Importantly, the transitional vertebra is distinct from and above the last rib-bearing vertebra in <i>Au. sediba</i>, resulting in a functionally longer lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>. This configuration, along with a strongly wedged last lumbar vertebra and other indicators of lordotic posture, would have contributed to a highly flexible spine that is derived compared with earlier members of the genus <i>Australopithecus</i> and similar to that of the Nariokotome <i>Homo erectus</i> skeleton.</p>

Characterization and Cloning of Grape Circular RNAs Identified the Cold Resistance-Related <i>Vv-circATS1</i>
<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely distributed and play essential roles in a series of developmental processes, although none have been identified or characterized in grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>). In this study, we characterized the function of grape circRNA and uncovered thousands of putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>-splicing sites by global transcriptome analysis. Our results indicated that several reported circRNA prediction algorithms should be used simultaneously to obtain comprehensive and reliable circRNA predictions in plants. Furthermore, the length of introns flanking grape circRNAs was closely related to exon circularization. Although the longer introns flanking grape circRNAs appeared to circularize more efficiently, a 20- to 50-nt region seemed large enough to drive grape circRNA biogenesis. In addition, the endogenous introns flanking circularized exon(s) in conjunction with reverse complementary sequences could support the accurate and efficient circularization of various exons in grape, which constitutes a new tool for exploring the functional consequences caused by circRNA expression. Finally, we identified 475 differentially expressed circRNAs in grape leaves under cold stress. Overexpression of <i>Vv-circATS1</i>, a circRNA derived from <i>glycerol-3-P acyltransferase</i>, improved cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), while the linear RNA derived from the same sequence cannot. These results indicate the functional difference between circRNA and linear RNA, and provide new insight into plant abiotic stress resistance.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which plants activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK plants wilted earlier than wild-type plants, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK plants. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK plants displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>ed planthopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>grounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>ground but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear particles, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

Evidence for Exaptation of the <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> M20D Peptidase MpILR1 into the Tracheophyte Auxin Regulatory Pathway
<p>Auxin homeostasis is tightly regulated by several mechanisms, including conjugation of the hormone to specific moieties, such as amino acids or sugar. The inactive phytohormone conjugate is stored in large pools in plants and hydrolyzed to regain full activity. Many conjugate hydrolases (M20D metallopeptidases) have been identified and characterized throughout the plant kingdom. We have traced this regulatory gene family <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to liverwort (<i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>), a member of the most ancient extant land plant lineage, which emerged approximately 475 million years ago. We have isolated and characterized a single hydrolase homologue, dubbed <i>M. polymorpha</i> IAA-Leucine Resistant1 (MpILR1), from liverwort. MpILR1 can hydrolyze two auxin (indole acetic acid [IAA]) substrates (IAA-Leucine and IPA-Alanine) at very low levels of activity, but it cannot hydrolyze the two native auxin conjugates of liverwort (IAA-Glycine and IAA-Valine). We conclude from these results that liverwort likely does not employ active auxin conjugate hydrolysis as a regulatory mechanism and that conjugate homeostasis likely takes place in liverwort by passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>ground degradation. Furthermore, we present evidence that MpILR1 was probably exapted by tracheophytes over evolutionary time into the auxin regulatory pathway.</p>

Elucidation of the Mechanisms of Long-Distance mRNA Movement in a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>/Tomato Heterograft System
<p>Recent heterograft analyses showed that large-scale messenger RNA (mRNA) movement takes place in the phloem, but the number of mobile transcripts reported varies widely. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying large-scale mRNA movement remains limited. In this study, using a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>/tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) heterograft system and a transgenic approach involving potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), we found that: (1) the overall mRNA abundance in the leaf is not a good indicator of transcript mobility to the root; (2) increasing the expression levels of nonmobile mRNAs in the companion cells does not promote their mobility; (3) mobile mRNAs undergo degradation during their movement; and (4) some mRNAs arriving in roots move <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to shoots. These results indicate that mRNA movement has both regulated and unregulated components. The cellular origins of mobile mRNAs may differ between herbaceous and woody species. Taken together, these findings suggest that the long-distance movement of mRNAs is a complex process and that elucidating the physiological roles associated with this movement is challenging but remains an important task for future research.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to regulate the circadian oscillator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian oscillator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to invertebrate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer model of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, models with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of flow through the olfactory region (i.e. the olfactory recess plus airspace around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these models would have little to no flow through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the olfactory region. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the model with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull.</p>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss

Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher.

Custom-made total ankle arthroplasty for the salvage of major talar bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A failed total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is often associated with   much bone loss. As an alternative to arthrodesis, the surgeon may   consider a custom-made talar component to compensate for the bone   loss. Our aim in this study was to assess the functional and radiological   outcome after the use of such a component at mid- to long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 12 patients (five women and seven men, mean age 53   years; 36 to77) with a failed TAA and a large talar defect underwent   a revision procedure using a custom-made talar component. The design   of the custom-made components was based on CT scans and standard   radiographs, when compared with the contralateral ankle. After the   anterior talocalcaneal joint was fused, the talar component was   introduced and fixed to the body of the calcaneum.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (1 to 13), 11 ankles were stable   with no radiological evidence of loosening. Only one was lost to   follow-up. The mean arc of movement was 21<sup>°</sup> (10<sup>°</sup> to   35<sup>°</sup>). A total of nine patients (75%) were satisfied or   very satisfied with the outcome, two (17%) were satisfied but with   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ations and one (8%) was not satisfied. All but one patient   had an improvement in the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society   hindfoot score (p = 0.01). Just one patient developed deep infection,   leading to arthrodesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A custom-made talar component yielded satisfactory results with   regard to function, stability and satisfaction. This should encourage   the use of such components as an alternative to arthrodesis of the   ankle in patients with a failed TAA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:231–6.</p></sec>

Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using polyetheretherketone oblique cages with and without a titanium coating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of using a   polyetheretherketone cage with (TiPEEK) and without a titanium coating   (PEEK) for instrumented transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomised clinical pilot trial of 40 patients   who were scheduled to undergo a TLIF procedure at one or two levels   between L2 and L5. The Oswestry disability index (ODI), EuroQoL-5D,   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> and leg pain were determined pre-operatively, and at three,   six, and 12 months post-operatively. Fusion rates were assessed   by thin slice CT at three months and by functional radiography at   12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At final follow-up, one patient in each group had been lost to   follow-up. Two patients in each of the PEEK and TiPEEK groups were   revised for pseudarthrosis (p = 1.00). The rate of complete or partial   fusion at three months was 91.7% in both groups. Overall, there   were no significant differences in ODI or in radiological outcomes   between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Favourable results with identical clinical outcomes and a high   rate of fusion was seen in both groups.

Three groups of dissatisfied patients exist after total knee arthroplasty: early, persistent, and late
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to assess whether patient satisfaction   one year after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) changed with longer   follow-up. The secondary aims were to identify predictors of satisfaction   at one year, persistence of patient dissatisfaction, and late onset   dissatisfaction in patients that were originally satisfied at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective cohort consisting of 1369 patients undergoing   a primary TKA for osteoarthritis that had not undergone revision   were identified from an established arthroplasty database. Patient   demographics, comorbidities, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities   Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire   scores were collected preoperatively, and one and five years postoperatively.   In addition, patient satisfaction was assessed at one and five years   postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify   independent predictors of satisfaction at one and five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall rate of satisfaction did not change from one (91.7%,   n = 1255) to five (90.1%, n = 1234) years (p = 0.16). Approximately   half (n = 53/114) of the patients who were dissatisfied at one year   became satisfied with their TKA at five years, whereas 6% (n = 74/1255)   of those who were satisfied at one year became dissatisfied at five   years. At one year, patients with lung disease (p = 0.04), with   depression (p = 0.001), with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> pain (p < 0.001), undergoing unilateral   TKA (p = 0.001), or with a worse preoperative WOMAC pain score (p = 0.04)   were more likely to be dissatisfied. Patients with gastric ulceration   (p = 0.04) and a worse WOMAC stiffness score (p = 0.047) were at increased   risk of persistent dissatisfaction at five years. In contrast, a   worse WOMAC pain score (p = 0.01) at one year was a predictor of   dissatisfaction in previously satisfied patients at five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Three groups of dissatisfied patients exist after TKA: ‘early’   dissatisfaction at one year, ‘persistent’ dissatisfaction with longer   follow-up, and ‘late’ dissatisfaction developing in previously satisfied   patients at one year.

Role of En2 in the tectal laminar formation of chick embryos
<p>The chick optic tectum consists of 16 laminae. Here, we report contribution of En2 to laminar formation in chick optic tecta. En2 is specifically expressed in laminae g-j of stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale (SGFS). Misexpression of En2 resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial layers (laminae a-f of SGFS), where endogenous En2 is not expressed. Misexpression of En2 before postmitotic cells had left the ventricular layer indicated that En2-misexpressing cells stopped at the laminae of endogenous En2 expression and that they did not migrate into the superficial layers. Induction of En2 misexpression using a tetracycline-inducible system after the postmitotic cells had reached superficial layers also resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial layers. Time-lapse analysis showed that En2-misexpressing cells migrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> from the superficial layers towards the middle layers, where En2 is strongly expressed endogenously. Our results suggest a potential role of En2 in regulating cell migration and positioning in the tectal laminar formation.</p>

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong>ground:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and overtesting are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and efficiency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">back</span></strong> pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an efficiency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1) and an efficiency of 49.9% (95% CI, 47.7–52.2) for the ADD-RS ≤1/DD− strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Integration of ADD-RS (either ADD-RS=0 or ADD-RS ≤1) with DD may be considered to standardize diagnostic rule out of AAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the integration of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and integrated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CFR was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial scar and ischemia, rate-pressure product, type of radiotracer or stress agent used, and revascularization after scan (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–2.31; <i>P</i><0.001 per unit decrease in CFR after adjustment for maximal MBF and clinical covariates; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84–1.27; <i>P</i>=0.8 per unit decrease in maximal MBF after adjustment for CFR and clinical covariates). In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ed maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular mortality of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year. These patients were predominantly women (70%). Patients with p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ed CFR but impaired maximal MBF had low cardiovascular mortality of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ed CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular mortality of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year. In multivariable analysis, the cardiovascular mortality risk gradient across the 4 concordant or discordant categories was independently driven by impaired CFR irrespective of impairment in maximal MBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CFR is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF. Concordant and discordant categories based on integrating CFR and maximal MBF identify unique prognostic phenotypes of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p></sec>

Evidence Supporting the Existence of a Distinct Obese Phenotype of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure (HF) with p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ed ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous syndrome. Phenotyping patients into pathophysiologically homogeneous groups may enable better targeting of treatment. Obesity is common in HFpEF and has many cardiovascular effects, suggesting that it may be a viable candidate for phenotyping. We compared cardiovascular structure, function, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e capacity in subjects with obese HFpEF, those with nonobese HFpEF, and control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Subjects with obese HFpEF (body mass index ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; n=99), nonobese HFpEF (body mass index <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; n=96), and nonobese control subjects free of HF (n=71) underwent detailed clinical assessment, echocardiography, and invasive hemodynamic exercise testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with both subjects with nonobese HFpEF and control subjects, subjects with obese HFpEF displayed increased plasma volume (3907 mL [3563–4333 mL] versus 2772 mL [2555–3133 mL], and 2680 mL [2380–3006 mL]; <i>P</i><0.0001), more concentric left ventricular remodeling, greater right ventricular dilatation (base, 34±7 versus 31±6 and 30±6 mm, <i>P</i>=0.0005; length, 66±7 versus 61±7 and 61±7 mm, <i>P</i><0.0001), more right ventricular dysfunction, increased epicardial fat thickness (10±2 versus 7±2 and 6±2 mm; <i>P</i><0.0001), and greater total epicardial heart volume (945 mL [831–1105 mL] versus 797 mL [643–979 mL] and 632 mL [517–768 mL]; <i>P</i><0.0001), despite lower N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was correlated with body mass and plasma volume in obese HFpEF (<i>r</i>=0.22 and 0.27, both <i>P</i><0.05) but not in nonobese HFpEF (<i>P</i>≥0.3). The increase in heart volumes in obese HFpEF was associated with greater pericardial restraint and heightened ventricular interdependence, reflected by increased ratio of right- to left-sided heart filling pressures (0.64±0.17 versus 0.56±0.19 and 0.53±0.20; <i>P</i>=0.0004), higher pulmonary venous pressure relative to left ventricular transmural pressure, and greater left ventricular eccentricity index (1.10±0.19 versus 0.99±0.06 and 0.97±0.12; <i>P</i><0.0001). Interdependence was enhanced as pulmonary artery pressure load increased (<i>P</i> for interaction <0.05). Compared with those with nonobese HFpEF and control subjects, obese patients with HFpEF displayed worse exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption, 7.7±2.3 versus 10.0±3.4 and12.9±4.0 mL/min·kg; <i>P</i><0.0001), higher biventricular filling pressures with exercise, and depressed pulmonary artery vasodilator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity-related HFpEF is a genuine form of cardiac failure and a clinically relevant phenotype that may require specific treatments.</p></sec>

Exploring Coronary Circulatory Response to Stenosis and Its Association With Invasive Physiologic Indexes Using Absolute Myocardial Blood Flow and Coronary Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although invasive physiological assessment for coronary stenosis has become a standard practice to guide treatment strategy, coronary circulatory response and changes in invasive physiological indexes, according to different anatomic and hemodynamic lesion severity, have not been fully demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred fifteen patients with left anterior descending artery stenosis who underwent both <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia positron emission tomography and invasive physiological measurement were analyzed. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) measured with positron emission tomography and invasively measured coronary pressures were used to calculate microvascular resistance and stenosis resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With progressive worsening of angiographic stenosis severity, both resting and hyperemic transstenotic pressure gradient and stenosis resistance increased (<i>P</i><0.001 for all) and hyperemic MBF (<i>P</i><0.001) and resting microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.012) decreased. Resting MBF (<i>P</i>=0.383) and hyperemic microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.431) were not changed and maintained stable. Both fractional flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e and instantaneous wave-free ratio decreased as angiographic stenosis severity, stenosis resistance, and transstenotic pressure gradient increased and hyperemic MBF decreased (all <i>P</i><0.001).

Excess Cardiovascular Risk in Women Relative to Men Referred for Coronary Angiography Is Associated With Severely Impaired Coronary Flow Reserve, Not Obstructive Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) fatality rates are higher for women than for men, yet obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is less prevalent in women. Coronary flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e (CFR), an integrated measure of large- and small-vessel CAD and myocardial ischemia, identifies patients at risk for CVD death, but is not routinely measured in clinical practice. We sought to investigate the impact of sex, CFR, and angiographic CAD severity on adverse cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Consecutive patients (n=329, 43% women) referred for invasive coronary angiography after stress testing with myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography and with left ventricular ejection fraction >40% were followed (median, 3.0 years) for a composite end point of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death and hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction or heart failure. The extent and severity of angiographic CAD were estimated by using the CAD prognostic index, and CFR was quantified by using positron emission tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Although women in comparison with men had lower pretest clinical scores, rates of prior myocardial infarction, and burden of angiographic CAD (<i>P</i><0.001), they demonstrated greater risk of CVD events, even after adjustment for traditional risk factors, imaging findings, and early revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–4.02; <i>P</i>=0.03). Impaired CFR was similarly present among women and men, but in patients with low CFR (<1.6, n=163), women showed a higher frequency of nonobstructive CAD, whereas men showed a higher frequency of severely obstructive CAD (<i>P</i>=0.002). After also adjusting for CFR, the effect of sex on outcomes was no longer significant. When stratified by sex and CFR, only women with severely impaired CFR demonstrated significantly increased adjusted risk of CVD events (<i>P</i><0.0001, <i>P</i> for interaction=0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Women referred for coronary angiography had a significantly lower burden of obstructive CAD in comparison with men but were not protected from CVD events. Excess cardiovascular risk in women was independently associated with impaired CFR, representing a hidden biological risk, and a phenotype less amenable to revascularization. Impaired CFR, particularly absent severely obstructive CAD, may represent a novel target for CVD risk reduction.</p></sec>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

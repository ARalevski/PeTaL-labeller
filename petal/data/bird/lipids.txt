Effect of Distinct Lifestyle Interventions on Mobilization of Fat Storage Pools
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We aimed to assess whether distinct lifestyle strategies can differentially affect specific body adipose depots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an 18-month randomized controlled trial among 278 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity (75%) or dyslipidemia in an isolated workplace with a monitored provided lunch. Participants were randomized to isocaloric low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet+28 g walnuts/day with/without added moderate physical activity (PA; 80% aerobic; supervised/free gym membership). Overall primary outcome was body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> redistribution, and the main specific end point was visceral adipose tissue (VAT). We further followed the dynamics of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> depots (deep and superficial subcutaneous, liver, pericardial, muscle, pancreas, and renal sinus) by magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 278 participants (age, 48 years, 89% men, body mass index, 30.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 86% completed the trial with good adherence. The low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> group preferentially decreased reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> intake (−21.0% versus −11.5% for the MED/LC; <i>P</i><0.001), and the MED/LC group decreased reported carbohydrates intake (−39.5% versus −21.3% for the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> group; <i>P</i><0.001). The PA<sup>+</sup> groups significantly increased the metabolic equivalents per week versus the PA<sup>−</sup> groups (19.0 versus 2.1; <i>P</i>=0.009). Whereas final moderate weight loss was indifferent, exercise attenuated the waist circumference rebound with the greatest effect in the MED/LC<sup>PA+</sup> group (<i>P</i><0.05). VAT (−22%), intrahepatic (−29%), and intrapericardial (−11%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>s declines were higher than pancreatic and femur intermuscular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>s (1% to 2%) loss. Independent of weight loss, PA<sup>+</sup> with either diet had a significantly greater effect on decreasing VAT (mean of difference, −6.67cm<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, −14.8 to −0.45) compared with PA<sup>−</sup>. The MED/LC diet was superior to the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet in decreasing intrahepatic, intrapericardial, and pancreatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.05 for all). In contrast, renal sinus and femoral intermuscular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>s were not differentially altered by lifestyle interventions but by weight loss per se. In multivariate models further adjusted for weight loss, losing VAT or intrahepatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> was independently associated with improved lipid profile, losing deep subcutaneous adipose tissue with improved insulin sensitivity, and losing superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue remained neutral except for an association with decreased leptin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Moderate weight loss alone inadequately reflects the significant lifestyle effects on atherogenic and diabetogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> depots. The MED/LC diet mobilizes specific ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> depots, and exercise has an independent contribution to VAT loss. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> depots exhibit diverse responsiveness and are differentially related to cardiometabolic markers. Distinct lifestyle protocols may uniquely induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> mobilization from specific anatomic sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> uptake, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> uptake. Under low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> acquisition by reallocating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Factorial Effects of Evolocumab and Atorvastatin on Lipoprotein Metabolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), such as evolocumab, lower plasma low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (LDL)-chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol concentrations. Evolocumab is under investigation for its effects on cardiovascular outcomes in statin-treated, high-risk patients. The mechanism of action of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> metabolism remains to be fully evaluated. Stable isotope tracer kinetics can effectively elucidate the mode of action of new lipid-regulating pharmacotherapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a 2-by-2 factorial trial of the effects of atorvastatin (80 mg daily) and subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg every 2 weeks) for 8 weeks on the plasma kinetics of very-low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (VLDL)–apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> B-100 (apoB), intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>–apoB, and LDL-apoB in 81 healthy, normolipidemic, nonobese men. The kinetics of apoB in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s was studied using a stable isotope infusion of D3-leucine, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and multicompartmental modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Atorvastatin and evolocumab independently accelerated the fractional catabolism of VLDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001 and <i>P</i>.032, respectively), intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.021 and <i>P</i>=.002, respectively), and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001, both interventions). Evolocumab but not atorvastatin decreased the production rate of intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.043) and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001), which contributed to the reduction in the plasma pool sizes of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> particles. The reduction in LDL-apoB and LDL-chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol concentrations was significantly greater with combination versus either monotherapy (<i>P</i><0.001). Whereas evolocumab but not atorvastatin lowered the concentration of free PCSK9, atorvastatin lowered the lathosterol/camp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol ratio (a measure of chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol synthesis/absorption) and apoC-III concentration. Both interventions decreased plasma apoE, but neither significantly altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> lipase and chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>yl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong> protein mass or measures of insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healthy, normolipidemic subjects, evolocumab decreased the concentration of atherogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s, particularly LDL, by accelerating their catabolism. Reductions in intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> and LDL production also contributed to the decrease in LDL particle concentration with evolocumab by a mechanism distinct from that of atorvastatin.

Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition With Alirocumab on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Healthy Humans
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lowers plasma low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (LDL) chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol and apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> B100 (apoB). Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> or intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (IDL) metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (a) levels. The regulation of plasma Lp(a) levels, including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eighteen (10 F, 8 mol/L) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. They received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. At the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (FCRs) and production rates (PRs) of apoB and apo(a) were determined. In 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1%, LDL-apoB by 56.3%, and plasma Lp(a) by 18.7%. The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4% increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9% reduction in LDL-apoB PR. The latter was due to a 46.1% increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL. The FCR of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) PR. Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s-apoB and very low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR. These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition. The increase in apo(a) FCR during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased LDL receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong> ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the activity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced activation or inhibition of MR activity, we studied the response to eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, prog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>one, 19-norprog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>one, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not activated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s, and others required higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong> concentrations for activation. Prog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>one, 19-norprog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>one, and spironolactone did not activate full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained activity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the activation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist activity of prog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>one for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that prog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>one may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Lipid-filled vesicles modulate macrophages
<p>Adipose (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>) tissue is a major site of energy storage that responds to fluctuations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability to maintain systemic metabolic homeostasis (<i>1</i>). Adipocytes take up circulating free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acids (FFAs) from the blood and store them in lipid droplets in response to increased insulin concentrations (which occur after feeding); they then hydrolyze lipids to release FFAs under conditions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> deprivation. A variety of other cell types are present within adipose tissue, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). In addition to their roles in immune surveillance and clearance of cellular debris, ATMs are important for lipid buffering and regulate adipose tissue function in both healthy and diseased states (<i>2</i>). Owing to the rising global incidence of chronic obesity and associated health issues, there is renewed interest in understanding how adipose tissue functions in physiological and pathological settings. On page 989 of this issue, Flaherty <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that adipocytes communicate with ATMs by releasing a distinct class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) called adipocyte-derived exosomes (AdExos), which are loaded with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> and appear to be derived directly from adipocyte lipid droplets. The uptake of AdExos by resident ATMs allows for the direct transfer of lipids, revealing a form of intercellular communication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> exchange with important implications for obesity-associated pathologies.</p>

<i>Drosophila</i> insulin release is triggered by adipose Stunted ligand to brain Methuselah receptor
<p>Animals adapt their growth rate and body size to available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s by a general modulation of insulin–insulin-like growth factor signaling. In <i>Drosophila</i>, dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s promote the release in the hemolymph of brain insulin-like peptides (Dilps), which in turn activate systemic organ growth. Dilp secretion by insulin-producing cells involves a relay through unknown cytokines produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> cells. Here, we identify Methuselah (Mth) as a secretin-incretin receptor subfamily member required in the insulin-producing cells for proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> coupling. We further show, using genetic and ex vivo organ culture experiments, that the Mth ligand Stunted (Sun) is a circulating insulinotropic peptide produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> cells.

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerol</span></strong>-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerol</span></strong>ipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerol</span></strong> (TAG) in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerol</span></strong> concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerol</span></strong> lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerol</span></strong>ipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

Vascular Smooth Muscle–Specific Progerin Expression Accelerates Atherosclerosis and Death in a Mouse Model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Progerin, an aberrant protein that accumulates with age, causes the rare genetic disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Patients who have HGPS exhibit ubiquitous progerin expression, accelerated aging and atherosclerosis, and die in their early teens, mainly of myocardial infarction or stroke. The mechanisms underlying progerin-induced atherosclerosis remain unexplored, in part, because of the lack of appropriate animal models.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We generated an atherosclerosis-prone model of HGPS by crossing apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> E–deficient (<i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup>) mice with <i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice ubiquitously expressing progerin. To induce progerin expression specifically in macrophages or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we crossed <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup> mice with <i>LysMCre</i> and <i>SM22αCre</i> mice, respectively. Progerin expression was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. Cardiovascular alterations were determined by immunofluorescence and histology in male mice fed normal chow or a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet. In vivo low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> retention was assessed by intravenous injection of fluorescently labeled human low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>. Cardiac electric defects were evaluated by electrocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice with ubiquitous progerin expression exhibited a premature aging phenotype that included failure to thrive and shortened survival. In addition, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet–fed <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice developed a severe vascular pathology, including medial VSMC loss and lipid retention, adventitial fibrosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis, thus resembling most aspects of cardiovascular disease observed in patients with HGPS. The same vascular alterations were also observed in <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice expressing progerin specifically in VSMCs, but not in <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>LysMCre</i> mice with macrophage-specific progerin expression. Moreover, <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice had a shortened lifespan despite the lack of any overt aging phenotype. Aortas of ubiquitously and VSMC-specific progerin-expressing mice exhibited increased retention of fluorescently labeled human low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>, and atheromata in both models showed vulnerable plaque features. Immunohistopathological examination indicated that <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice, unlike <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice, die of atherosclerosis-related causes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have generated the first mouse model of progerin-induced atherosclerosis acceleration, and demonstrate that restricting progerin expression to VSMCs is sufficient to accelerate atherosclerosis, trigger plaque vulnerability, and reduce lifespan. Our results identify progerin-induced VSMC death as a major factor triggering atherosclerosis and premature death in HGPS.</p></sec>

Ribosomes on the night shift
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, life involves two simple goals: survival and reproduction. But these goals are fundamentally at odds. Reproduction depends on growth, but attempts to grow when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s are scarce can jeopardize survival. In cells, growth is accomplished in large part by ribosomes, huge RNA-protein machines that translate nucleic acid messages into protein, the main biochemical constituent of cells. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-rich conditions, cells can be filled with ribosomes; they comprise more than a third of total biomass in rapidly growing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>1</i>). But what happens to ribosomes when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> levels decline, as occurs sporadically in microbes and nightly in sleeping humans? Biosynthesis subsides, and ribosomes now serve as a reservoir of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s. Building on recent progress probing the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation from Gu <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Abu-Remaileh <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), on page 751 of this issue, Wyant <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) elucidate a pathway in which ribosomes are selectively digested, promoting survival in starved cells.</p>

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system
<p>Age-associated decline in regeneration capacity limits the restoration of nervous system functionality after injury. In a model for de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ation, we found that old mice fail to resolve the inflammatory response initiated after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> damage. Aged phagocytes accumulated excessive amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> debris, which triggered chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol crystal formation and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and stimulated inflammasomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> debris clearance required chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol transporters, including apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> E. Stimulation of reverse chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity of old mice to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ate lesioned tissue. Thus, chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> debris can overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol into crystals and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that impedes tissue regeneration.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Enhancing natriuretic peptide signaling in adipose tissue, but not in muscle, protects against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance
<p>In addition to controlling blood pressure, cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) can stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes and promote the “browning” of white adipose tissue. NPs may also increase the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. To unravel the contribution of NP-stimulated metabolism in adipose tissue compared to that in muscle in vivo, we generated mice with tissue-specific deletion of the NP clearance receptor, NPRC, in adipose tissue (<i>Nprc</i><sup><i>AKO</i></sup>) or in skeletal muscle (<i>Nprc</i><sup><i>MKO</i></sup>). We showed that, similar to <i>Nprc</i> null mice, <i>Nprc</i><sup><i>AKO</i></sup> mice, but not <i>Nprc</i><sup><i>MKO</i></sup> mice, were resistant to obesity induced by a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet. <i>Nprc</i><sup><i>AKO</i></sup> mice exhibited increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased glucose uptake into brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>.

These findings support the conclusion that NPRC in adipose tissue is a critical regulator of energy metabolism and suggest that inhibiting this receptor may be an important avenue to explore for combating metabolic disease.</p>

Structural basis for the recognition of Sonic Hedgehog by human Patched1

Sustained climate warming drives declining marine biological productivity

Cholesterol crystals impede nerve repair

Plants transfer lipids to sustain colonization by mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic fungi

Decarboxylative borylation

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes

Plant responses to soil biota varied according to their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different plant responses to soil biota promote local plant diversity.</p>

Genome-Wide Identification of <i>Medicago</i> Peptides Involved in Macronutrient Responses and Nodulation
<p>Growing evidence indicates that small, secreted peptides (SSPs) play critical roles in legume growth and development, yet the annotation of SSP-coding genes is far from complete. Systematic reannotation of the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> genome identified 1,970 homologs of established SSP gene families and an additional 2,455 genes that are potentially novel SSPs, previously unreported in the literature. The expression patterns of known and putative SSP genes based on 144 RNA sequencing data sets covering various stages of macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> deficiencies and symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and mycorrhiza were investigated. Focusing on those known or suspected to act via receptor-mediated signaling, 240 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-responsive and 365 nodulation-responsive Signaling-SSPs were identified, greatly expanding the number of SSP gene families potentially involved in acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> deficiencies and nodulation. Synthetic peptide applications were shown to alter root growth and nodulation phenotypes, revealing additional regulators of legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> acquisition. Our results constitute a powerful resource enabling further investigations of specific SSP functions via peptide treatment and reverse genetics.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Legume TOR Protein Kinase Regulates <i>Rhizobium</i> Symbiosis and Is Essential for Infection and Nodule Development
<p>The target of rapamycin (<i>TOR</i>) protein kinase regulates metabolism, growth, and life span in yeast, animals, and plants in coordination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> status and environmental conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-dependent nature of <i>TOR</i> functionality makes this kinase a putative regulator of symbiotic associations involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> acquisition. However, <i>TOR</i>’s role in these processes remains to be understood. Here, we uncovered the role of <i>TOR</i> during the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>)-<i>Rhizobium tropici</i> (<i>Rhizobium</i>) symbiotic interaction. <i>TOR</i> was expressed in all tested bean tissues, with higher transcript levels in the root meristems and senesced nodules. We showed <i>TOR</i> promoter expression along the progressing infection thread and in the infected cells of mature nodules. Posttranscriptional gene silencing of <i>TOR</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) showed that this gene is involved in lateral root elongation and root cell organization and also alters the density, size, and number of root hairs. The suppression of <i>TOR</i> transcripts also affected infection thread progression and associated cortical cell divisions, resulting in a drastic reduction of nodule numbers. <i>TOR</i>-RNAi resulted in reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and altered <i>CyclinD1</i> and <i>CyclinD3</i> expression, which are crucial factors for infection thread progression and nodule organogenesis. Enhanced expression of <i>TOR</i>-regulated <i>ATG</i> genes in <i>TOR</i>-RNAi roots suggested that <i>TOR</i> plays a role in the recognition of <i>Rhizobium</i> as a symbiont. Together, these data suggest that <i>TOR</i> plays a vital role in the establishment of root nodule symbiosis in the common bean.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the females were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and females continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected males were quicker to court females than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the proximal humerus for the primary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a surgeon decide whether to preserve the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the proximal humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> rim separating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> rim on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour.   A smaller tumour, the presence of a continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> rim and the identification   of the axillary nerve on pre-operative MRI will persuade surgeons   to opt for a deltoid resecting procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1244–9.</p></sec>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering With Evolocumab and Outcomes in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol and cardiovascular events in the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk). We investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at baseline if they had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. An additional outcome of interest was major adverse limb events defined as acute limb ischemia, major amputation, or urgent peripheral revascularization for ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Three thousand six hundred forty-two patients (13.2%) had PAD (1505 with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke). Evolocumab significantly reduced the primary end point consistently in patients with PAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.0098) and without PAD (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; <i>P</i>=0.0003; <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.40). For the key secondary end point, the HRs were 0.73 (0.59–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.0040) for those with PAD and 0.81 (0.73–0.90; <i>P</i><0.0001) for those without PAD (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.41). Because of their higher risk, patients with PAD had larger absolute risk reductions for the primary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.6% without PAD) and the key secondary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.4% without PAD). Evolocumab reduced the risk of major adverse limb events in all patients (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.88; <i>P</i>=0.0093) with consistent effects in those with and without known PAD. There was a consistent relationship between lower achieved low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol and lower risk of limb events (<i>P</i>=0.026 for the beta coefficient) that extended down to <10 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with PAD are at high risk of cardiovascular events, and PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab significantly reduced that risk with large absolute risk reductions.

High-Density Lipoprotein Subspecies Defined by Presence of Apolipoprotein C-III and Incident Coronary Heart Disease in Four Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The causal role of high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (HDL) chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol in cardioprotection has been questioned by genetic and randomized studies. Novel measures that relate to HDL function may contribute new information to the prediction of cardiovascular risk. Apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> C-III (apoC-III) is a key regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> metabolism. We investigated whether subspecies of HDL defined by apoC-III are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used immunoaffinity chromatography to measure the apoA-I concentrations of HDL that contains and lacks apoC-III in 2 prospective studies of adults free of CHD. In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 5657 participants (52% women, 52–72 years of age) were followed for risk of CHD from 2000 to 2002 through 2013. In a case-cohort study nested within the DCH study (Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health), 3642 participants (47% women, 51–64 years of age) were followed from 1994 to 1997 through 2010. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis that combined these results with the previously published findings from 2 cohort studies that used similar laboratory methodology to measure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s, totaling 2997 incident cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ApoC-III was found on 6% to 8% of apoA-I. The 2 HDL subspecies showed opposing associations, with risk of CHD in each of the individual cohorts and in the meta-analysis (<i>P</i> heterogeneity between the 2 subspecies <0.01). HDL that contains apoC-III was associated with a higher risk of CHD (pooled relative risk per standard deviation, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.18), whereas HDL that lacks apoC-III was associated with lower risk (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.83). The relative risk for HDL lacking apoC-III was even more negative than the relative risk for total HDL (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.87).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings from 4 prospective studies support the hypothesis that apoC-III may mark a subfraction of HDL that is associated with higher risk of CHD.

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol Education Program Expert Panel on Chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young adulthood.

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both models without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease. The newly developed anti-Tspan12 antibody has therapeutic effects in vasoproliferative retinopathy and can enhance the potency of existing anti- vascular endothelial growth factor agents.</p></sec>

P2X<sub>7</sub> Deficiency Blocks Lesional Inflammasome Activity and Ameliorates Atherosclerosis in Mice

In contrast, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient macrophages showed no activation of caspase 1 after sequential stimulation while still expressing a basal amount of interleukin-1β. P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor was higher expressed in murine atherosclerotic lesions, particularly by lesional macrophages. After 16 weeks of a high-chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol diet, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice showed smaller atherosclerotic lesions than P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent mice (0.162 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.023 [n=9], P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> low density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> receptor<sup>−/−</sup> : 0.084 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.01 [n=11], <i>P</i>=0.004) with a reduced amount of lesional macrophages.

Baseline HDL particle number was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08).

Inhibiting Insulin-Mediated β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic Receptor Activation Prevents Diabetes-Associated Cardiac Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity independently increase the risk of heart failure by incompletely understood mechanisms. We propose that hyperinsulinemia might promote adverse consequences in the hearts of subjects with type-2 DM and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet feeding was used to induce obesity and DM in wild-type mice or mice lacking β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) or β-arrestin2. Wild-type mice fed with high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet were treated with a β-blocker carvedilol or a GRK2 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2) inhibitor.

The expression of PDE4D is also elevated in human hearts with DM. The induction of PDE4D expression is mediated by an insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate, and GRK2 and β-arrestin2-dependent transactivation of a β<sub>2</sub>AR-extracellular regulated protein kinase signaling cascade. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2, or genetic deletion of β<sub>2</sub>AR or β-arrestin2, all significantly attenuate insulin-induced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase and PDE4D induction to prevent DM-related contractile dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies elucidate a novel mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia contributes to heart failure by increasing PDE4D expression and identify β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2 as plausible therapeutic targets for preventing or treating heart failure in subjects with type 2 DM.</p></sec>

MNADK, a novel liver-enriched mitochondrion-localized NAD kinase
<p>NADP<sup>+</sup> and its reducing equivalent NADPH are essential for counteracting oxidative damage. Mitochondria are the major source of oxidative stress, since the majority of superoxide is generated from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Because NADP<sup>+</sup> cannot pass through the mitochondrial membrane, NADP<sup>+</sup> generation within mitochondria is critical. However, only a single human NAD kinase (NADK) has been identified, and it is localized to the cytosol. Therefore, sources of mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> and mechanisms for maintaining its redox balance remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the uncharacterized human gene C5ORF33, named MNADK (mouse homologue 1110020G09Rik), encodes a novel mitochondrion-localized NAD kinase. In mice <i>MNADK</i> is mostly expressed in the liver, and also abundant in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>, heart, muscle and kidney, all being mitochondrion-rich. Indeed, MNADK is localized to mitochondria in Hep G2 cells, a human liver cell line, as demonstrated by fluorescence imaging. Having a conserved NAD kinase domain, a recombinant MNADK showed NAD kinase activity, confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Consistent with a role of NADP<sup>+</sup> as a coenzyme in anabolic reactions, such as lipid synthesis, <i>MNADK</i> is nutritionally regulated in mice. Fasting increased <i>MNADK</i> levels in liver and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>, and obesity dramatically reduced its level in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>. <i>MNADK</i> expression was suppressed in human liver tumors. Identification of MNADK immediately suggests a model in which NADK and MNADK are responsible for <i>de novo</i> synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> in cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, and therefore provides novel insights into understanding the sources and mechanisms of mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADH production in human cells.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

Phosphate Starvation Alters Abiotic-Stress-Induced Cytosolic Free Calcium Increases in Roots
<p>Phosphate (Pi) deficiency strongly limits plant growth, and plant roots foraging the soil for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s need to adapt to optimize Pi uptake. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to signal in root development and adaptation but has to be tightly controlled, as it is highly toxic to Pi metabolism. Under Pi starvation and the resulting decreased cellular Pi pool, the use of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) as a signal transducer may therefore have to be altered. Employing aequorin-expressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we show that Pi starvation, but not nitrogen starvation, strongly dampens the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increases evoked by mechanical, salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress as well as by extracellular nucleotides. The altered root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to extracellular ATP manifests during seedling development under chronic Pi deprivation but can be reversed by Pi resupply. Employing ratiometric imaging, we delineate that Pi-starved roots have a normal response to extracellular ATP at the apex but show a strongly dampened [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in distal parts of the root tip, correlating with high reactive oxygen species levels induced by Pi starvation. Excluding iron, as well as Pi, rescues this altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response and restores reactive oxygen species levels to those seen under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-replete conditions. These results indicate that, while Pi availability does not seem to be signaled through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, Pi starvation strongly affects stress-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signatures. These data reveal how plants can integrate nutritional and environmental cues, adding another layer of complexity to the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a signal transducer.</p>

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p>Plastid isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes carotenoids, chlorophylls, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tocopherol</span></strong>s, and multiple hormones, are essential for plant growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i>SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tocopherol</span></strong>s, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides chlorophyll for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of chlorophyll for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p>Root size and architecture are important crop plant traits, as they determine access to water and soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of root growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged root system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in roots to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving root functions. This was achieved through root-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to roots did not penalize shoot growth or seed yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low soil mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, seeds contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term drought conditions, indicating lower drought sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that root engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> efficiency, biofortification, and drought tolerance.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>al glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxychol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxychol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxychol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong> 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato.</p>

A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth rates during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth rate and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth rates in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

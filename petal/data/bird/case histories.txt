Rewritable multi-event analog recording in bacterial and mammalian cells
<p>We present two CRISPR-mediated analog multi-event <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing apparatus (CAMERA) systems that use base editors and Cas9 nucleases to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> cellular events in bacteria and mammalian cells. The devices <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> signal amplitude or duration as changes in the ratio of mutually exclusive DNA sequences (CAMERA 1) or as single-base modifications (CAMERA 2). We achieved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing of multiple stimuli in bacteria or mammalian cells, including exposure to antibiotics, nutrients, viruses, light, and changes in Wnt signaling. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing to multicopy plasmids, reliable readout requires as few as 10 to 100 cells. The order of stimuli can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed through an overlapping guide RNA design, and memories can be erased and re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed over multiple cycles. CAMERA systems serve as “cell data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ers” that write a history of endogenous or exogenous signaling events into permanent DNA sequence modifications in living cells.</p>

‘CAMERA’ records cell action with new CRISPR tricks
<p>Biologists long have devised ways to track the inner working of cells, tagging genes with fluorescent proteins and the like to better understand diseases, embryology, and environmental impacts. With the advent of CRISPR, best known as a genome editing tool, many groups have tried to fashion novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing devices. In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that float around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er one to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which works in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base editor to alter the DNA in a "safe harbor" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe harbor gene's sequence can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The availability and diversity of lower limb revascularization procedures have increased in England in the past decade.

Major lower limb amputations and deaths within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of major amputation and death, adjusted for patient age, sex, comorbidity score, indication for the intervention (intermittent claudication, severe limb ischemia without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of tissue loss, severe limb ischemia with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of ulceration, severe limb ischemia with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of gangrene/osteomyelitis), and comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated 1-year risk of major amputation decreased from 5.7% (in 2006–2007) to 3.9% (in 2014–2015) following endovascular revascularization, and from 11.2% (2006–2007) to 6.6% (2014–2015) following surgical procedures. The risk of death after both types of revascularization also decreased. These trends were observed for all indication categories, with the largest reductions found in patients with severe limb ischemia with ulceration or gangrene. Overall, morbidity increased over the study period, and a larger proportion of patients was treated for the severe end of the peripheral artery disease spectrum using less invasive procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings show that from 2006 to 2015, the overall survival increased and the risk of major lower limb amputation decreased following revascularization.

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many biological processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying biological signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal biological information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “biological tape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er” in which biological signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling biological events on a large scale.</p>

A Pleistocene ice core record of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> concentrations
<p>The history of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) is inextricably linked to the coevolution of life and Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. Reconstructions of past <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> rely on models and proxies but often markedly disagree. We present a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> reconstructed using O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> ratios from ancient air trapped in ice. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> indicates that <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> declined by 7 per mil (0.7%) over the past 800,000 years, requiring that O<sub>2</sub> sinks were ~2% larger than sources. This decline is consistent with changes in burial and weathering fluxes of organic carbon and pyrite driven by either Neogene cooling or increasing Pleistocene erosion rates. The 800,000-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of steady average carbon dioxide partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub>) but declining <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> provides distinctive evidence that a silicate weathering feedback stabilizes <i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> on million-year time scales.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed human cell types via the collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histori</span></strong>es of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histori</span></strong>es of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Temperature-dependent hypoxia explains biogeography and severity of end-Permian marine mass extinction
<p>Rapid climate change at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago) is the hypothesized trigger for the largest mass extinction in Earth’s history.

The effect of these changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Φ), a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O<sub>2</sub> loss can account for more than half the magnitude of the “Great Dying.”</p>

Plio-Pleistocene decline of African megaherbivores: No evidence for ancient hominin impacts
<p>It has long been proposed that pre-modern hominin impacts drove extinctions and shaped the evolutionary history of Africa’s exceptionally diverse large mammal communities, but this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. We analyzed eastern African herbivore communities spanning the past 7 million years—encompassing the entirety of hominin evolutionary history—to test the hypothesis that top-down impacts of tool-bearing, meat-eating hominins contributed to the demise of megaherbivores prior to the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> a steady, long-term decline of megaherbivores beginning ~4.6 million years ago, long before the appearance of hominin species capable of exerting top-down control of large mammal communities and predating evidence for hominin interactions with megaherbivore prey. Expansion of C<sub>4</sub> grasslands can account for the loss of megaherbivore diversity.</p>

Quantifying reputation and success in art
<p>In areas of human activity where performance is difficult to quantify in an objective fashion, reputation and networks of influence play a key role in determining access to resources and rewards. To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>s the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.</p>

East Asian hydroclimate modulated by the position of the westerlies during Termination I
<p>Speleothem oxygen isotope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s have revolutionized our understanding of the paleo East Asian monsoon, yet there is fundamental disagreement on what they represent in terms of the hydroclimate changes. We report a multiproxy speleothem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of monsoon evolution during the last deglaciation from the middle Yangtze region, which indicates a wetter central eastern China during North Atlantic cooling episodes, despite the oxygen isotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> suggesting a weaker monsoon. We show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved if the changes are interpreted as a lengthening of the Meiyu rains and shortened post-Meiyu stage, in accordance with a recent hypothesis. Model simulations support this interpretation and further reveal the role of the westerlies in communicating the North Atlantic influence to the East Asian climate.</p>

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy
<p>Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments conducted with compositionally asymmetric low molar mass poly(isoprene)-<i>b</i>-poly(lactide) diblock copolymers reveal an extraordinary thermal history dependence. The development of distinct periodic crystalline or aperiodic quasicrystalline states depends on how specimens are cooled from the disordered state to temperatures below the order-disorder transition temperature. Whereas direct cooling leads to the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed morphologies, rapidly quenched samples that are then heated from low temperature form the hexagonal C14 and cubic C15 Laves phases commonly found in metal alloys. Self-consistent mean-field theory calculations show that these, and other associated Frank-Kasper phases, have nearly degenerate free energies, suggesting that processing history drives the material into long-lived metastable states defined by self-assembled particles with discrete populations of volumes and polyhedral shapes.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain data are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa.

Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

Medium-term outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiological   outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective review of all 95 Universal-2 TWAs which   were performed in our institution between 2003 to 2012 in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis. A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a mean   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The mean follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing pain on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.   Any adverse effects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed with particular emphasis on   residual pain, limitation of movement, infection, dislocation and   the need for revision surgery.</p><p>Radiographic assessment was performed pre-operatively and at   three, six and 12 months post-operatively, and annually thereafter.   Arthroplasties were assessed for distal row intercarpal fusion and   loosening. Radiolucent zones around the components were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed   according to a system developed at our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean worst pain was 8.1 (3 to 10) pre-operatively and 5.4   (0 to 10) at latest follow-up (p < 0.001).

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the risk of circulatory-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using area under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the derivation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y death. The tool may allow for estimation of circulatory risk and improve the triage of survivors of cardiac arrest without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction at the point of care.</p></sec>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Angiography Versus Hemodynamics to Predict the Natural History of Coronary Stenoses
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed stable coronary artery disease and in whom no revascularization was performed, we compared the respective values of angiographic diameter stenosis (DS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in predicting natural history.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The present analysis included the 607 patients from the FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography in Multivessel Evaluation 2) in whom no revascularization was performed. FFR varied from 0.20 to 1.00 (average 0.74±0.16), and DS (by quantitative coronary analysis) varied from 8% to 98% (average 53±15). The primary end point, defined as vessel-oriented clinical end point (VOCE) at 2 years, was a composite of prospectively adjudicated cardiac death, vessel-related myocardial infarction, vessel-related urgent, and not urgent revascularization. The stenoses were divided into 4 groups according to FFR and %DS values: positive concordance (FFR≤0.80; DS≥50%), negative concordance (FFR>0.80; DS<50%), positive mismatch (FFR≤0.80; DS<50%), and negative mismatch (FFR>0.80; DS≥50%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of VOCE was highest in the positive concordance group (log rank: X<sup>2</sup>=80.96; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lowest in the negative concordance group. The rate of VOCE was higher in the positive mismatch group than in the negative mismatch group (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.21–0.67; <i>P</i>=0.001). There was no significant difference in VOCE between the positive concordance and positive mismatch groups (FFR≤0.80; hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–1.09; <i>P</i>=0.149) and no significant difference in rate of VOCE between the negative mismatch and negative concordance groups (FFR>0.80; hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–3.74; <i>P</i>=0.067).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with stable coronary disease, physiology (FFR) is a more important determinant of the natural history of coronary stenoses than anatomy (DS).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Long-term continuous electrocardiographic monitoring shows a substantial prevalence of asymptomatic, subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) in patients with pacemakers and patients with cryptogenic stroke. Whether SCAF is also common in other patients without these conditions is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We implanted subcutaneous electrocardiographic monitors (St. Jude CONFIRM-AF) in patients ≥65 years of age attending cardiovascular or neurology outpatient clinics if they had no history of atrial fibrillation but had any of the following: CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of ≥2, sleep apnea, or body mass index >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Eligibility also required either left atrial enlargement (≥4.4 cm or volume ≥58 mL) or increased (≥290 pg/mL) serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide). Patients were monitored for SCAF lasting ≥5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred fifty-six patients were followed up for 16.3±3.8 months. Baseline age was 74±6 years; mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 4.1±1.4; left atrial diameter averaged 4.7±0.8 cm; and 48% had a prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism. SCAF ≥5 minutes was detected in 90 patients (detection rate, 34.4%/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7–42.3). Baseline predictors of SCAF were increased age (hazard ratio [HR] per decade, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11–2.15), left atrial dimension (HR per centimeter diameter, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09–1.86), and blood pressure (HR per 10 mm Hg, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), but not prior stroke. The rate of occurrence of SCAF in those with a history of stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack was 39.4%/y versus 30.3%/y without (<i>P</i>=0.32). The cumulative SCAF detection rate was higher (51.9%/y) in those with left atrial volume above the median value of 73.5 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SCAF is frequently detected by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in older patients without a history of atrial fibrillation who are attending outpatient cardiology and neurology clinics.

Genotype-Phenotype Correlation of <i>SCN5A</i> Mutation for the Clinical and Electrocardiographic Characteristics of Probands With Brugada Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The genotype-phenotype correlation of <i>SCN5A</i> mutations as a predictor of cardiac events in Brugada syndrome remains controversial. We aimed to establish a registry limited to probands, with a long follow-up period, so that the genotype-phenotype correlation of <i>SCN5A</i> mutations in Brugada syndrome can be examined without patient selection bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This multicenter registry enrolled 415 probands (n=403; men, 97%; age, 46±14 years) diagnosed with Brugada syndrome whose <i>SCN5A</i> gene was analyzed for mutations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During a mean follow-up period of 72 months, the overall cardiac event rate was 2.5%/y. In comparison with probands without mutations (<i>SCN5A</i> (–), n=355), probands with <i>SCN5A</i> mutations (<i>SCN5A</i> (+), n=60) experienced their first cardiac event at a younger age (34 versus 42 years, <i>P</i>=0.013), had a higher positive rate of late potentials (89% versus 73%, <i>P</i>=0.016), exhibited longer P-wave, PQ, and QRS durations, and had a higher rate of cardiac events (<i>P</i>=0.017 by log-rank).

Depression Treatment and 1-Year Mortality After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed in the medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s despite a PHQ score ≥10.

Altered DNA Methylation of Long Noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Promotes Mineralization by Silencing <i>NOTCH1</i>
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcific aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal mineralization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of <i>NOTCH1</i>, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed that lncRNA <i>H19 (H19</i>) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with <i>H19</i> expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that <i>H19</i> induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that <i>H19</i> silenced <i>NOTCH1</i> by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of <i>H19</i> in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> and decreased the level of <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>, 2 downstream targets repressed by <i>NOTCH1</i>. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented <i>H19</i>-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of <i>H19</i> during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of <i>NOTCH1.</i></p></sec>

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Women with stillbirths had 2.69 (95% confidence interval, 2.06–3.50), 1.74 (1.32–2.28), and 2.42 (1.59–3.69) times the rates of myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and renovascular hypertension, respectively, as women with no stillbirths. Compared with women with no miscarriages, women with miscarriages had 1.13 (1.03–1.24), 1.16 (1.07–1.25), and 1.20 (1.05–1.38) times the rates of these same outcomes, respectively; these associations were dose dependent, with each additional miscarriage increasing the rates of myocardial and cerebral infarction and renovascular hypertension by 9% (3% to 16%), 13% (7% to 19%), and 19% (9% to 30%), respectively. Associations were strongest in younger women (<35 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Pregnancy losses were associated with subsequent risks of myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and renovascular hypertension, consistent with either shared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y or the initiation of pathological processes by a pregnancy loss leading to atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote re-entrant arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> algorithms at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with <i>SCN10A</i> and <i>SCN5A</i> variants. <i>SCN10A</i> variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5272 “heart-healthy” study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants.

Cooperative Regulatory Functions of miR858 and MYB83 during Cyst Nematode Parasitism
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) recently have been established as key regulators of transcriptome reprogramming that define cell function and identity. Nevertheless, the molecular functions of the greatest number of miRNA genes remain to be determined. Here, we report cooperative regulatory functions of miR858 and its MYB83 transcription factor target gene in transcriptome reprogramming during <i>Heterodera</i> cyst nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Gene expression analyses and promoter-GUS fusion assays <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed a role of miR858 in posttranscriptional regulation of <i>MYB83</i> in the <i>Heterodera schachtii-</i>induced feeding sites, the syncytia. Constitutive overexpression of miR858 interfered with <i>H. schachtii</i> parasitism of Arabidopsis, leading to reduced susceptibility, while reduced miR858 abundance enhanced plant susceptibility. Similarly, <i>MYB83</i> expression increases were conducive to nematode infection because overexpression of a noncleavable coding sequence of <i>MYB83</i> significantly increased plant susceptibility, whereas a <i>myb83</i> mutation rendered the plants less susceptible. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes involved in hormone signaling pathways, defense response, glucosinolate biosynthesis, cell wall modification, sugar transport, and transcriptional control are the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>ical factors by which MYB83 facilitates nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we discovered that miR858-mediated silencing of <i>MYB83</i> is tightly regulated through a feedback loop that might contribute to fine-tuning the expression of more than a thousand of MYB83-regulated genes in the <i>H. schachtii</i>-induced syncytium. Together, our results suggest a role of the miR858-MYB83 regulatory system in finely balancing gene expression patterns during <i>H. schachtii</i> parasitism of Arabidopsis to ensure optimal cellular function.</p>

Talpid Mole Phylogeny Unites Shrew Moles and Illuminates Overlooked Cryptic Species Diversity
<p>The mammalian family Talpidae (moles, shrew moles, desmans) is characterized by diverse ecomorphologies associated with terrestrial, semi-aquatic, semi-fossorial, fossorial, and aquatic-fossorial lifestyles. Prominent specializations involved with these different lifestyles, and the transitions between them, pose outstanding questions regarding the evolutionary history within the family, not only for living but also for fossil taxa. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and biogeographic history of the family using 19 nuclear and 2 mitochondrial genes (∼16 kb) from ∼60% of described species representing all 17 genera. Our phylogenetic analyses help settle classical questions in the evolution of moles, identify an ancient (mid-Miocene) split within the monotypic genus <i>Scaptonyx</i>, and indicate that talpid species richness may be nearly 30% higher than previously recognized. Our results also uniformly support the monophyly of long-tailed moles with the two shrew mole tribes and confirm that the Gansu mole is the sole living Asian member of an otherwise North American radiation. Finally, we provide evidence that aquatic specializations within the tribes Condylurini and Desmanini evolved along different morphological trajectories, though we were unable to statistically reject monophyly of the strictly fossorial tribes Talpini and Scalopini. </p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ers. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   control of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   capsular infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents.

Computer hexapod-assisted orthopaedic surgery provides a predictable and safe method of femoral deformity correction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Computer hexapod assisted orthopaedic surgery (CHAOS), is a method   to achieve the intra-operative correction of long bone deformities   using a hexapod external fixator before definitive internal fixation   with minimally invasive stabilisation techniques.</p><p>The aims of this study were to determine the reliability of this   method in a consecutive case series of patients undergoing femoral   deformity correction, with a minimum six-month follow-up, to assess   the complications and to define the ideal group of patients for   whom this treatment is appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s and radiographs of all patients who underwent   CHAOS for femoral deformity at our institution between 2005 and   2011 were retrospectively reviewed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s were available for all   55 consecutive procedures undertaken in 49 patients with a mean   age of 35.6 years (10.9 to 75.3) at the time of surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients were assessed at a mean interval of 44 months (6 to   90) following surgery. The indications were broad; the most common   were vitamin D resistant rickets (n = 10), growth plate arrest (n   = 6) and post-traumatic deformity (n = 20).</p><p>Multi-planar correction was required in 33 cases. A single level   osteotomy was performed in 43 cases. Locking plates were used to   stabilise the osteotomy in 33 cases and intramedullary nails in   the remainder. Complications included two nonunions, one death,   one below-knee deep vein thrombosis, one deep infection and one   revision procedure due to initial under-correction. There were no   neurovascular injuries or incidence of compartment syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the largest reported series of femoral deformity corrections   using the CHAOS technique. This series demonstrates that precise   intra-operative realignment is possible with a hexapod external   fixator prior to definitive stabilisation with contemporary internal   fixation. This combination allows reproducible correction of complex femoral   deformity from a wide variety of diagnoses and age range with a   low complication rate.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:283–8.</p></sec>

The use of the distal radius and ulna classification for the prediction of growth
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the use of the distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification   for the prediction of peak growth (PG) and growth cessation (GC)   in 777 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. We compare this classification   with other commonly used parameters of maturity.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The following data were extracted from the patients’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s   and radiographs: chronological age, body height (BH), arm span (AS),   date of menarche, Risser sign, DRU grade and status of the phalangeal   and metacarpal physes. The mean rates of growth were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed according   to each parameter of maturity. PG was defined as the summit of the curve   and GC as the plateau in deceleration of growth. The rates of growth   at PG and GC were used for analysis using receiver operating characteristic   (ROC) curves to determine the strength and cutoff values of the   parameters of growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most specific grades for PG using the DRU classification   were radial grade 6 and ulnar grade 5, and for GC were radial grade   9 and ulnar grade 7. The DRU classification spanned both PG and   GC, enabling better prediction of these clinically relevant stages   than other methods. The rate of PG (≥ 0.7 cm/month) and GC (≤ 0.15   cm/month) was the same for girls and boys, in BH and AS measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to note that the DRU classification can   predict both PG and GC, providing evidence that it may aid the management   of patients with idiopathic scoliosis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1689–96.</p></sec>

The outpatient total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To examine incidence of complications associated with outpatient   total hip arthroplasty (THA), and to see if medical comorbidities   are associated with complications or extended length of stay.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From June 2013 to December 2016, 1279 patients underwent 1472   outpatient THAs at our free-standing ambulatory surgery centre.   Records were reviewed to determine frequency of pre-operative medical   comorbidities and post-operative need for overnight stay and complications   which arose.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In 87 procedures, the patient stayed overnight for 23-hour observation,   with 39 for convenience reasons and 48 (3.3%) for medical observation,   most frequently urinary retention (13), obstructive sleep apnoea   (nine), emesis (four), hypoxia (four), and pain management (six).   Five patients (0.3%) experienced major complications within 48 hours,   including three transferred to an acute facility; there was one   death. Overall complication rate requiring unplanned care was 2.2%   (32/1472). One or more major comorbidities were present in 647 patients   (44%), including previous coronary artery disease (CAD; 50), valvular   disease (nine), arrhythmia (219), thromboembolism history (28), obstructive   sleep apnoea (171), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD;   124), asthma (118), frequent urination or benign prostatic hypertrophy   (BPH; 217), or mild chronic renal insufficiency (11).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The presence of these comorbidities was not associated with medical   or surgical complications. However, presence of one or more major   comorbidity was associated with an increased risk of overnight observation.   Specific comorbidities associated with increased risk were CAD,   COPD, and frequent urination/BPH. Outpatient THA is safe for a large   proportion of patients without the need for a standardised risk   assessment score. Risk of complications is not associated with presence   of medical comorbidities.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):31–5.</p></sec>

The risk of cardiac failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with   metal-on-metal (MoM) arthroplasties of the hip have an increased   risk of cardiac failure compared with those with alternative types   of arthroplasties (non-MoM).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A linkage study between the National Joint Registry, Hospital   Episodes Statistics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s of the Office for National Statistics   on deaths was undertaken. Patients who underwent elective total   hip arthroplasty between January 2003 and December 2014 with no   past history of cardiac failure were included and stratified as   having either a MoM (n = 53 529) or a non-MoM (n = 482 247) arthroplasty.   The primary outcome measure was the time to an admission to hospital   for cardiac failure or death. Analysis was carried out using data   from all patients and from those matched by propensity score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The risk of cardiac failure was lower in the MoM cohort compared   with the non-MoM cohort (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.901; 95%   confidence interval (CI) 0.853 to 0.953). The risk of cardiac failure   was similar following matching (aHR 0.909; 95% CI 0.838 to 0.987)   and the findings were consistent in subgroup analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The risk of cardiac failure following total hip arthroplasty   was not increased in those in whom MoM implants were used, compared   with those in whom other types of prostheses were used, in the first   seven years after surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:20–7.</p></sec>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed diagnosis of AF. Heart failure was the quantitatively most important complication in patients with CHD and AF, with a 10.7% (70 of 654) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed diagnosis of heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The risk of AF in children and young adults with CHD was 22 times higher than that in matched control subjects. Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 patients with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 patients with CHD with AF had developed heart failure. The patient groups with the most complex congenital defects carried the greatest risk of AF and could be considered for targeted monitoring.</p></sec>

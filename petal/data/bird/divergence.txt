Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>s between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ed in patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Gene Tree Discordance Can Generate Patterns of Diminishing Convergence over Time
<p>Phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence is an exciting outcome of adaptive evolution, occurring when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the molecular basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which molecular evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an alternative cause of changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence levels over time in a primate dataset. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce patterns of diminishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence in primates. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, discordance due to errors in species tree inference can drive similar patterns. Though intramolecular epistasis could in principle create a pattern of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence over time, our results suggest a possible alternative explanation for this widespread pattern. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene tree discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of molecular evolution.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ently with C or N in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent sites, indicating site effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong> in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong> across species having <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>s in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than photosynthesis. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The structure of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the structure of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril structure, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient structural integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril structure, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril structure, and it is likely that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent effects of mutating members of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent CESA classes are the consequence of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent strategies to cope with water stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf water potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil water deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf water supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions depending on the genotype. Importantly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf water status.</p>

Analysis of Exocyst Subunit EXO70 Family Reveals Distinct Membrane Polar Domains in Tobacco Pollen Tubes
<p>The vesicle-tethering complex exocyst is one of the crucial cell polarity regulators. The EXO70 subunit is required for the targeting of the complex and is represented by many isoforms in angiosperm plant cells. This diversity could be partly responsible for the establishment and maintenance of membrane domains with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent composition. To address this hypothesis, we employed the growing pollen tube, a well-established cell polarity model system, and performed large-scale expression, localization, and functional analysis of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) EXO70 isoforms. Various isoforms localized to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent regions of the pollen tube plasma membrane, apical vesicle-rich inverted cone region, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The overexpression of major pollen-expressed EXO70 isoforms resulted in growth arrest and characteristic phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ions of tip swelling and apical invaginations. NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 occupied two distinct and mutually exclusive plasma membrane domains. Both isoforms partly colocalized with the exocyst subunit NtSEC3a at the plasma membrane, possibly forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent exocyst complex subpopulations. NtEXO70A1a localized to the small area previously characterized as the site of exocytosis in the tobacco pollen tube, while NtEXO70B1 surprisingly colocalized with the zone of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 colocalized to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent degrees with markers for the anionic signaling phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. In contrast, members of the EXO70 C class, which are specifically expressed in tip-growing cells, exhibited exocytosis-related functional effects in pollen tubes despite the absence of apparent plasma membrane localization. Taken together, our data support the existence of multiple membrane-trafficking domains regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent EXO70-containing exocyst complexes within a single cell.</p>

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used.

<p>Sexual competition among dioecious plants affects sex ratios and the spatial distribution of the sexes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent environments. At present, little is known about sexual dimorphisms induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate sex-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two females, two males, or one female and one male) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in competitive ability between males and females subjected to intrasexual competition were observed, although the growth of females was moderately greater under intersexual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in competitive ability, especially under intersexual competition. Under salinity stress, males showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed males than in females under intersexual competition. In addition, salt-stressed males accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than females. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of females in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of males growing intermixed with females under salt stress can importantly affect the sex ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 activation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in activating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 activation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 stimulation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent lines and with activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 activation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent pathways that result in activation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Zones, spots, and planetary-scale waves beating in brown dwarf atmospheres
<p>Brown dwarfs are massive analogs of extrasolar giant planets and may host types of atmospheric circulation not seen in the solar system. We analyzed a long-term Spitzer Space Telescope infrared monitoring campaign of brown dwarfs to constrain cloud cover <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions over a total of 192 rotations. The infrared brightness evolution is dominated by beat patterns caused by planetary-scale wave pairs and by a small number of bright spots. The beating waves have similar amplitudes but slightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent apparent periods because of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ing velocities or directions. The power spectrum of intermediate-temperature brown dwarfs resembles that of Neptune, indicating the presence of zonal temperature and wind speed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions. Our findings explain three previously puzzling behaviors seen in brown dwarf brightness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in photosynthetic parameters measured in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Changes in Anthocyanin Production during Domestication of <i>Citrus</i>
<p>Mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>), citron (<i>Citrus medica</i>), and pummelo (<i>Citrus maxima</i>) are important species of the genus <i>Citrus</i> and parents of the interspecific hybrids that constitute the most familiar commercial varieties of <i>Citrus</i>: sweet orange, sour orange, clementine, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Citron produces anthocyanins in its young leaves and flowers, as do species in genera closely related to <i>Citrus</i>, but mandarins do not, and pummelo varieties that produce anthocyanins have not been reported. We investigated the activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, which encodes a MYB transcription factor controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent accessions of a range of <i>Citrus</i> species and in domesticated cultivars. A white mutant of lemon lacks functional alleles of <i>Ruby</i>, demonstrating that <i>Ruby</i> plays an essential role in anthocyanin production in <i>Citrus</i>. Almost all the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in pigmentation by anthocyanins in <i>Citrus</i> species can be explained by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, caused by point mutations and deletions and insertions of transposable elements. Comparison of the allelic constitution of <i>Ruby</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent species and cultivars also helps to clarify many of the taxonomic relationships in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent species of <i>Citrus</i>, confirms the derivation of commercial varieties during domestication, elucidates the relationships within the subgenus <i>Papeda</i>, and allows a new genetic classification of mandarins.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high sequence identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel sequencing data, we studied the organization, sequence evolution, and functional attributes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read sequencing data, we uncovered both copy number and order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent paths of molecular tinkering by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion onto phenotypic trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion to phenotypic co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences at drug resistance loci due to historically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>entiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical Evaluation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were evaluated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent.

Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ion increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001).

Nationwide Study of the Treatment of Mycotic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Comparing Open and Endovascular Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No reliable comparative data exist between open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms (MAAAs). This nationwide study assessed outcomes after OR and EVAR for MAAA in a population-based cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for MAAAs in Sweden between 1994 and 2014 were identified in the Swedish vascular registry. The primary aim was to assess survival after MAAA with OR and EVAR. Secondary aims were analyses of the rate of recurrent infections and reoperations, and time trends in surgical treatment. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. A propensity score–weighted correction for risk factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in the 2 groups was performed, including the operation year to account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in treatment and outcomes over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 132 patients (0.6% of all operated abdominal aortic aneurysms in Sweden). Mean age was 70 years (standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ion, 9.2), and 50 presented with rupture. Survival at 3 months was 86% (95% confidence interval, 80%–92%), at 1 year 79% (72%–86%), and at 5 years 59% (50%–68%). The preferred operative technique shifted from OR to EVAR after 2001 (proportion EVAR 1994–2000 0%, 2001–2007 58%, 2008–2014 60%). Open repair was performed in 62 patients (47%): aortic resection and extra-anatomic bypass (n=7), in situ reconstruction (n=50), and patch plasty (n=3); 2 patients died intraoperatively. EVAR was performed in 70 patients (53%): standard EVAR (n=55), fenestrated/branched EVAR (n=8), and visceral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ion with stent grafting (n=7); no deaths occurred intraoperatively. Survival at 3 months was lower for OR than for EVAR (74% versus 96%, <i>P</i><0.001), with a similar trend present at 1 year (73% versus 84%, <i>P</i>=0.054).

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to water deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil water content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and water management drove most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette water content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-watered conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Bacterial Biosensors for in Vivo Spatiotemporal Mapping of Root Secretion
<p>Plants engineer the rhizosphere to their advantage by secreting various nutrients and secondary metabolites. Coupling transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) rhizosphere, a suite of bioreporters has been developed in <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv <i>viciae</i> strain 3841, and these detect metabolites secreted by roots in space and time. Fourteen bacterial <i>lux</i> fusion bioreporters, specific for sugars, polyols, amino acids, organic acids, or flavonoids, have been validated in vitro and in vivo. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent bacterial mutants (<i>nodC</i> and <i>nifH</i>), the process of colonization and symbiosis has been analyzed, revealing compounds important in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent steps of the rhizobium-legume association. Dicarboxylates and sucrose are the main carbon sources within the nodules; in ineffective (<i>nifH</i>) nodules, particularly low levels of sucrose were observed, suggesting that plant sanctions affect carbon supply to nodules. In contrast, high <i>myo</i>-inositol levels were observed prior to nodule formation and also in <i>nifH</i> senescent nodules. Amino acid biosensors showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent patterns: a γ-aminobutyrate biosensor was active only inside nodules, whereas the phenylalanine bioreporter showed a high signal also in the rhizosphere. The bioreporters were further validated in vetch (<i>Vicia hirsuta</i>), producing similar results. In addition, vetch exhibited a local increase of <i>nod</i> gene-inducing flavonoids at sites where nodules developed subsequently. These bioreporters will be particularly helpful in understanding the dynamics of root exudation and the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent molecules secreted into the rhizosphere.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing drought tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate drought stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a drought-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> × <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of droughted and irrigated plants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under drought, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon drought and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. Drought effects on miRNA abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of drought-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to drought.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three separate classes based on quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these inhibitors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent inhibitor compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence. Genotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in flowering time under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

Developmental Control and Plasticity of Fruit and Seed Dimorphism in <i>Aethionema arabicum</i>
<p>Understanding how plants cope with changing habitats is a timely and important topic in plant research. Phenotypic plasticity describes the capability of a genotype to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent phenotypes when exposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent environmental conditions. In contrast, the constant production of a set of distinct phenotypes by one genotype mediates bet hedging, a strategy that reduces the temporal variance in fitness at the expense of a lowered arithmetic mean fitness. Both phenomena are thought to represent important adaptation strategies to unstable environments. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena, partly due to the lack of suitable model systems. We used phylogenetic and comparative analyses of fruit and seed anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, and environmental responses to study fruit and seed heteromorphism, a typical morphological basis of a bet-hedging strategy of plants, in the annual Brassicaceae species <i>Aethionema arabicum</i>. Our results indicate that heteromorphism evolved twice within the Aethionemeae, including once for the monophyletic annual <i>Aethionema</i> clade. The dimorphism of <i>Ae. arabicum</i> is associated with several anatomic, biomechanical, gene expression, and physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences between the fruit and seed morphs. However, fruit ratios and numbers change in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent environmental conditions. Therefore, the life-history strategy of <i>Ae. arabicum</i> appears to be a blend of bet hedging and plasticity. Together with the available genomic resources, our results pave the way to use this species in future studies intended to unravel the molecular control of heteromorphism and plasticity.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ions at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ions from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Evolution of Ancient Functions in the Vertebrate Insulin-Like Growth Factor System Uncovered by Study of Duplicated Salmonid Fish Genomes
<p>Whole-genome duplication (WGD) was experienced twice by the vertebrate ancestor (2 rounds; 2R), again by the teleost fish ancestor (3R) and most recently in certain teleost lineages (4R). Consequently, vertebrate gene families are often expanded in 3R and 4R genomes. Arguably, many types of “functional divergence” present across 2R gene families will exceed that between 3R/4R paralogs of genes comprising 2R families. Accordingly, 4R offers a form of replication of 2R. Examining whether this concept has implications for molecular evolutionary research, we studied insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs), whose six 2R family members carry IGF hormones and regulate interactions between IGFs and IGF1-receptors (IGF1Rs). Using phylogenomic approaches, we resolved the complete IGFBP repertoire of 4R-derived salmonid fishes (19 genes; 13 more than human) and established evolutionary relationships/nomenclature with respect to WGDs. Traits central to IGFBP action were determined for all genes, including atomic interactions in IGFBP–IGF1/IGF2 complexes regulating IGF–IGF1R binding. Using statistical methods, we demonstrate that attributes of these protein interfaces are overwhelming a product of 2R IGFBP family membership, explain 49–68% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in <i>IGFBP</i> mRNA concentration in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent tissues, and strongly predict the strength and direction of <i>IGFBP</i> transcriptional regulation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ing nutritional states. The results support a model where vertebrate IGFBP family members evolved divergent structural attributes to provide distinct competition for IGFs with IGF1Rs, predisposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent functions in the regulation of IGF signaling. Evolution of gene expression then acted to ensure the appropriate physiological production of IGFBPs according to their structural specializations, leading to optimal IGF-signaling according to nutritional-status and the endocrine/local mode of action. This study demonstrates that relatively recent gene family expansion can facilitate inference of functional evolution within ancient genetic systems.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent ages and sizes in distinctly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong> between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Prospective randomised trial of non-operative <i>versus</i> operative management of olecranon fractures in the elderly
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial was to   compare non-operative and operative management for acute isolated   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ed fractures of the olecranon in patients aged ≥ 75 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to either non-operative management or   operative management with either tension-band wiring or fixation   with a plate. They were reviewed at six weeks, three and six months   and one year after the injury. The primary outcome measure was the   Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 19 patients were randomised to non-operative (n =   8) or operative (n = 11; tension-band wiring (n = 9), plate (n =   2)) management. The trial was stopped prematurely as the rate of   complications (nine out of 11, 81.8%) in the operative group was   considered to be unacceptable. There was, however, no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence   in the mean DASH scores between the groups at all times. The mean   score was 23 (0 to 59.6) in the non-operative group and 22 (2.5   to 57.8) in the operative group, one year after the injury (p =   0.763). There was no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence between groups in the   secondary outcome measures of the Broberg and Morrey Score or the   Mayo Elbow Score at any time during the one year following injury   (all    p ≥ 0.05). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data further support the role of primary non-operative   management of isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ed fractures of the olecranon in the   elderly. However, the non-inferiority of non-operative management   cannot be proved as the trial was stopped prematurely.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:964–72.</p></sec>

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the mean SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-open group (91% of mini-open repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; mean SST score 10.9 (standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deviat</span></strong>ion (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-open group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-open   group (mean ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-open group;   mean 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-open repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients. The functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence   did not translate into a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence in satisfaction.</p><p>Mini-open rotator cuff repair remains a useful technique despite   advances in arthroscopy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:245–9.</p></sec>

An analysis of 30-day mortality after weekend <i>versus</i> weekday elective joint arthroplasty in England and Wales
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate whether elective joint arthroplasty performed   at the weekend is associated with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent 30-day mortality <i>versus</i> that   performed between Monday and Friday.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We examined the 30-day cumulative mortality rate (Kaplan-Meier)   for all elective hip and knee arthroplasties performed in England   and Wales between 1st April 2003 and 31st December 2014, comprising   118 096 episodes undertaken at the weekend and 1 233 882 episodes   performed on a weekday. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression   models to assess for time-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion and adjusted for identified   risk factors for mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cumulative 30-day mortality for hip arthroplasty was 0.15%   (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.19) for patients operated   on at the weekend versus 0.20% (95% CI 0.19 to 0.21) for patients   undergoing surgery during the normal working week. For knee arthroplasty,   the cumulative 30-day mortality was 0.14% (95% CI 0.11 to 0.17)   for weekend-operated patients versus 0.18% (95% CI 0.17 to 0.19)   for weekday-operated patients.

Five-year follow-up of a prospective randomised trial comparing ceramic-on-metal and metal-on-metal bearing surfaces in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>The primary aim of this independent prospective randomised trial   was to compare serum metal ion levels for ceramic-on-metal (CoM)   and metal-on-metal (MoM) bearing surfaces in total hip arthroplasty   (THA). Our one-year results demonstrated elevation in metal ion   levels above baseline with no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence between the   CoM and MoM groups. This paper reviews the five-year data.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The implants used in each patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ed only in respect to   the type of femoral head (ceramic or metal). At five-year follow-up   of the 83 enrolled patients, data from 67 (36 CoM, 31 MoM) was available   for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean serum cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) ion levels remained   above baseline in both groups (CoM: Co 1.16 μg/l (0.41 to 14.67),   Cr 1.05 μg/l (0.16 to 12.58); MoM: Co 2.93 μg/l (0.35 to 30.29),   Cr 1.85 μg/l (0.36 to 17.00)) but the increase was significantly   less in the CoM cohort (Co <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence p = 0.001, Cr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence p   = 0.002). These medium-term results, coupled with lower revision   rates from national joint registries, suggest that the performance   of CoM THA may be superior to that of MoM. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While both bearing combinations have since been withdrawn these   results provide useful information for planning clinical surveillance   of CoM THAs and warrants continued monitoring.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1298–1303.</p></sec>

The Targon Femoral Neck hip screw <i>versus</i> cannulated screws for internal fixation of intracapsular fractures of the hip
<p>We compared a new fixation system, the Targon   Femoral Neck (TFN) hip screw, with the current standard treatment of   cannulated screw fixation. This was a single-centre, participant-blinded,   randomised controlled trial. Patients aged 65 years and over with   either a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ed or un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ed intracapsular fracture of the   hip were eligible. The primary outcome was the risk of revision   surgery within one year of fixation.</p><p>A total of 174 participants were included in the trial. The absolute   reduction in risk of revision was of 4.7% (95% CI 14.2 to 22.5)   in favour of the TFN hip screw (chi-squared test, p = 0.741), which   was less than the pre-specified level of minimum clinically important   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence.

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on plain radiographs and CT scans. The measurements of inclination on   plain radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ence between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on plain radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among palms from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ent geographical regions, but lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions of important oil palm traits.</p>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differ</span></strong>ences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of cemented acetabular components as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty. Used   as a local treatment, a higher local dose of bisphosphonate can   be achieved without systemic exposure. We wished to see if this   principle could be applied usefully in total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with   60 participants, we compressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gauz</span></strong>e soaked in bisphosphonate solution   (ibandronate) or saline against the acetabular bone bed immediately   before cementing the acetabular component. RSA, classification of   radiolucent lines, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario McMasters   Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were carried out at three-,   six-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the cemented acetabular component relative to the   pelvis was reduced by movement almost half in the ibandronate group,   when measured as maximum total point or as movement of the femoral   head (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Radiolucent lines after   one year were classified as absent, partial or complete, and correlated with   treatment (rho 0.37; p = 0.004). Only three of 30 patients in the   ibandronate group had complete lines, compared with 13 of 28 in   the placebo group (p = 0.002). There were no significant effects   on HHS or WOMAC score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Considering the power of RSA to predict loosening of cemented   acetabular components, and the likelihood that radiolucent lines   indicate risk of loosening, these data suggest that local treatment   with a bisphosphonate can reduce the risk of late aseptic loosening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:317â€“24.</p></sec>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>e. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>es, while the winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>e can live up to 10 times longer. For summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>es, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>es can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Genome sequence of <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314
<p>Awamori is a traditional distilled beverage made from steamed Thai-Indica rice in Okinawa, Japan. For brewing the liquor, two microbes, local kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> and awamori yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are involved. In contrast, that yeasts are used for ethanol fermentation throughout the world, a characteristic of Japanese fermentation industries is the use of <i>Aspergillus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s as a source of enzymes for the maceration and saccharification of raw materials. Here we report the draft genome of a kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>, <i>A. luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604). The total length of nonredundant sequences was nearly 34.7 Mb, comprising approximately 2,300 contigs with 16 telomere-like sequences. In total, 11,691 genes were predicted to encode proteins. Most of the housekeeping genes, such as transcription factors and <i>N</i>-and <i>O</i>-glycosylation system, were conserved with respect to <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. An alternative oxidase and acid-stable α-amylase regarding citric acid production and fermentation at a low pH as well as a unique glutamic peptidase were also found in the genome. Furthermore, key biosynthetic gene clusters of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B were absent when compared with <i>A. niger</i> genome, showing the safety of <i>A. luchuensis</i> for food and beverage production. This genome information will facilitate not only comparative genomics with industrial kuro-koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s, but also molecular breeding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s in improvements of awamori fermentation.</p>

Real-time imaging of DNA loop extrusion by condensin
<p>It has been hypothesized that SMC protein complexes such as condensin and cohesin spatially organize chromosomes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extrud</span></strong>ing DNA into large loops. We directly visualized the formation and processive extension of DNA loops by yeast condensin in real time. Our findings constitute unambiguous evidence for loop extrusion. We observed that a single condensin complex is able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extrud</span></strong>e tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. Condensin-induced loop extrusion was strictly asymmetric, which demonstrates that condensin anchors onto DNA and reels it in from only one side. Active DNA loop extrusion by SMC complexes may provide the universal unifying principle for genome organization.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>es, and these changes could contribute to differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>e-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 activation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong> doubt on the role of β-arrestins in activating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 activation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 stimulation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with activation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 activation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in activation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes. By contrast, typical synthetic materials cannot grow and reconstruct their structures once formed. We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” polymeric materials that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the materials are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stamp</span></strong>ing. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel materials for applications such as soft robots and intelligent devices.</p>

Genome-wide de novo risk score implicates promoter variation in autism spectrum disorder
<p>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the first genome-wide evaluations of the contribution of de novo noncoding mutations to complex disorders. Using WGS, we identified 255,106 de novo mutations among sample genomes from members of 1902 quartet families in which one child, but not a sibling or their parents, was affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In contrast to coding mutations, no noncoding functional annotation category, analyzed in isolation, was significantly associated with ASD. Casting noncoding variation in the context of a de novo risk score across multiple annotation categories, however, did demonstrate association with mutations localized to promoter regions. We found that the strongest driver of this promoter signal emanates from evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites distal to the transcription start site. These data suggest that de novo mutations in promoter regions, characterized by evolutionary and functional signatures, contribute to ASD.</p>

Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent
<p>Current genetic data are equivocal as to whether goat domestication occurred multiple times or was a singular process. We generated genomic data from 83 ancient goats (51 with genome-wide coverage) from Paleolithic to Medieval contexts throughout the Near East. Our findings demonstrate that multiple divergent ancient wild goat sources were domesticated in a dispersed process that resulted in genetically and geographically distinct Neolithic goat populations, echoing contemporaneous human divergence across the region. These early goat populations contributed differently to modern goats in Asia, Africa, and Europe. We also detect early selection for pigmentation, stature, reproduction, milking, and response to dietary change, providing 8000-year-old evidence for human agency in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>ing genome variation within a partner species.</p>

Polio outbreaks in the DRC threaten eradication effort
<p>There's an alarming polio outbreak in the Democratic of the Congo (DRC) that you have probably never heard of. Part of the reason is that it is overshadowed by Ebola. But part is because it is caused not by the wild virus that is hanging on by a thread in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and perhaps Nigeria, but by a rare mutant derived from the weakened live virus in the oral polio vaccine, which has regained its neurovirulence and ability to spread. Public health experts have worked for months to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stamp</span></strong> out the virus, but it keeps spreading. It has already paralyzed 29 children, and on 21 June a case was reported on the border with Uganda, far outside the known outbreak zone, heightening fears that the virus will sweep across Africa. The DRC is "absolutely" the most worrisome polio outbreak today, says Michel Zaffran, who heads the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in Geneva at the World Health Organization.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coin</span></strong>ed the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Molecular structure of human P-glycoprotein in the ATP-bound, outward-facing conformation
<p>The multidrug transporter permeability (P)–glycoprotein is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–binding cassette exporter responsible for clinical resistance to chemotherapy. P-glycoprotein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extrud</span></strong>es toxic molecules and drugs from cells through ATP-powered conformational changes. Despite decades of effort, only the structures of the inward-facing conformation of P-glycoprotein are available. Here we present the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing conformation, determined by cryo–electron microscopy at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer occluding two ATP molecules. The drug-binding cavity observed in the inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space and compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release. The structure evokes a model in which the dynamic nature of P-glycoprotein enables translocation of a large variety of substrates.</p>

In situ measurements of Saturn’s ionosphere show that it is dynamic and interacts with the rings

The Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument detected a cold, dense, and dynamic ionosphere at Saturn that interacts with the rings. Plasma densities reached up to 1000 cubic centimeters, and electron temperatures were below 1160 kelvin near closest approach. The density varied between orbits by up to two orders of magnitude.

Fabrication of fillable microparticles and other complex 3D microstructures
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures created by microfabrication and additive manufacturing have demonstrated value across a number of fields, ranging from biomedicine to microelectronics. However, the techniques used to create these devices each have their own characteristic set of advantages and limitations with regards to resolution, material compatibility, and geometrical constraints that determine the types of microstructures that can be formed. We describe a microfabrication method, termed StampEd Assembly of polymer Layers (SEAL), and create injectable pulsatile drug-delivery microparticles, pH sensors, and 3D microfluidic devices that we could not produce using traditional 3D printing. SEAL allows us to generate microstructures with complex geometry at high resolution, produce fully enclosed internal cavities containing a solid or liquid, and use potentially any thermoplastic material without processing additives.</p>

High-performance vitrimers from commodity thermoplastics through dioxaborolane metathesis

Vitrimers, which are polymer networks able to shuffle chemical bonds through exchange reactions, could address these demands if they were prepared from existing plastics and processed with fast production rates and current equipment. We report the metathesis of dioxaborolanes, which is rapid and thermally robust, and use it to prepare vitrimers from polymers as different as poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and high-density polyethylene that, although permanently cross-linked, can be processed multiple times by means of extrusion or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong></span></strong>ing.

Density functional theory is straying from the path toward the exact functional
<p>The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coin</span></strong>: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Poly(A) Ribonuclease Controls the Cellotriose-Based Interaction between <i>Piriformospora indica</i> and Its Host Arabidopsis
<p><i>Piriformospora indica</i>, an endophytic root-colonizing fungus, efficiently promotes plant growth and induces resistance to abiotic stress and biotic diseases. <i>P. indica</i> fungal cell wall extract induces cytoplasmic calcium elevation in host plant roots. Here, we show that cellotriose (CT) is an elicitor-active cell wall moiety released by <i>P. indica</i> into the medium. CT induces a mild defense-like response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane potential, and the expression of genes involved in growth regulation and root development. CT-based cytoplasmic calcium elevation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots does not require the BAK1 coreceptor or the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels TPC1, GLR3.3, GLR2.4, and GLR2.5 and operates synergistically with the elicitor chitin. We identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant (<i>cytoplasmic</i> <i>calcium elevation mutant</i>) impaired in the response to CT and various other cellooligomers (<i>n</i> = 2–7), but not to chitooligomers (<i>n</i> = 4–8), in roots. The mutant contains a single nucleotide exchange in the gene encoding a poly(A) ribonuclease (AtPARN; At1g55870) that degrades the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs. The wild-type <i>PARN</i> cDNA, expressed under the control of a 35S promoter, complements the mutant phenotype.

Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two <i>Helicoverpa</i> species
<p>Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are soluble proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>H. assulta</i>. We expressed the protein in bacteria and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar solution, CSP4 is partly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extrud</span></strong>ed from the proboscis. A solution of protein can also fill a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>ing in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Twenty-Year Outcome After Mitral Repair Versus Replacement for Severe Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mitral valve (MV) repair is preferred over replacement in clinical guidelines and is an important determinant of the indication for surgery in degenerative mitral regurgitation. However, the level of evidence supporting current recommendations is low, and recent data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong> doubts on its validity in the current era. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to analyze very long-term outcome after MV repair and replacement for degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MIDA (Mitral Regurgitation International Database) is a multicenter registry enrolling patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet in 6 tertiary European and US centers. We analyzed the outcome after MV repair (n=1709) and replacement (n=213) overall, by propensity score matching, and by inverse probability-of-treatment weighting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, patients undergoing MV repair were younger, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to present with a posterior leaflet prolapse than those undergoing MV replacement. After propensity score matching and inverse probability-of-treatment weighting, the 2 treatments groups were balanced, and absolute standardized differences were usually <10%, indicating adequate match. Operative mortality (defined as a death occurring within 30 days from surgery or during the same hospitalization) was lower after MV repair than after replacement in both the entire population (1.3% versus 4.7%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the propensity-matched population (0.2% versus 4.4%; <i>P</i><0.001). During a mean follow-up of 9.2 years, 552 deaths were observed, of which 207 were of cardiovascular origin. Twenty-year survival was better after MV repair than after MV replacement in both the entire population (46% versus 23%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the matched population (41% versus 24%; <i>P</i><0.001). Similar superiority of MV repair was obtained in patient subsets on the basis of age, sex, or any stratification criteria (all <i>P</i><0.001). MV repair was also associated with reduced incidence of reoperations and valve-related complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet referred to mitral surgery, MV repair was associated with lower operative mortality, better long-term survival, and fewer valve-related complications compared with MV replacement.</p></sec>

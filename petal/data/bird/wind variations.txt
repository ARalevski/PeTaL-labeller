Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Life history responses of meerkats to seasonal changes in extreme environments
<p>Species in extreme habitats increasingly face changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al climate, but the demographic mechanisms through which these changes affect population persistence remain unknown. We investigated how changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al rainfall and temperature influence vital rates and viability of an arid environment specialist, the Kalahari meerkat, through effects on body mass. We show that climate change–induced reduction in adult mass in the prebreeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> would decrease fecundity during the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> and increase extinction risk, particularly at low population densities. In contrast, a warmer nonbreeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> resulting in increased mass and survival would buffer negative effects of reduced rainfall during the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, ensuring persistence. Because most ecosystems undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al climate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions, a full understanding of species vulnerability to global change relies on linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al trait and population dynamics.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than photosynthesis. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in ambient temperature.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Temporal and spatial patterns of internal and external stem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a sub-Mediterranean oak
<p>To accurately estimate stem respiration (<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>), measurements of both carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux to the atmosphere (<i>E</i><sub>A</sub>) and internal CO<sub>2</sub> flux through xylem (<i>F</i><sub>T</sub>) are needed because xylem sap transports respired CO<sub>2</sub> upward. However, reports of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al dynamics of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, temperature, sap flow and shoot water potential, were measured in <i>Quercus pyrenaica</i> Willd. in four measurement campaigns during one growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>. Substantial daytime depressions in temperature-normalized <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> were observed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel hysteresis between stem temperature and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the transpiration stream. Low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> throughout the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> was mainly explained by <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> (>90%). Internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] was found to vary vertically along the stems. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ality in resistance to radial CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion was related to shoot water potential. The low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> observed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem respiration in response to a legacy of coppicing as well as high radial diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low water content of stems. Long-term studies analyzing temporal and spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and their interactions are needed to mechanistically understand and model respiration of woody tissues.</p>

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood formation. We investigated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall formation, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall formation as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al control of secondary cell wall formation of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood formation and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion onto phenotypic trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion to phenotypic co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in bunch number per month were mainly due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Human influence on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature
<p>We provide scientific evidence that a human-caused signal in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle of tropospheric temperature has emerged from the background noise of natural variability. Satellite data and the anthropogenic “fingerprint” predicted by climate models show common large-scale changes in geographical patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle amplitude. These common features include increases in amplitude at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, and small changes in the tropics. Simple physical mechanisms explain these features. The model fingerprint of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle provide powerful evidence for a significant human effect on Earth’s climate.</p>

Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al camouflage by molting to a white winter coat, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter coat color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter coats in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

Recent natural selection causes adaptive evolution of an avian polygenic trait

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Geographic Variation in Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Medicare and Veterans Affairs Populations
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it is historically underused. We sought to evaluate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in cardiac rehabilitation participation across the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From administrative data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system and a 5% Medicare sample, we used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to identify patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery from 2007 to 2011. After excluding patients who died in ≤30 days of hospitalization, we calculated the percentage of patients who participated in ≥1 outpatient visits for cardiac rehabilitation during the 12 months after hospitalization. We estimated adjusted and standardized rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation by state using hierarchical logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, participation in cardiac rehabilitation was 16.3% (23 403/143 756) in Medicare and 10.3% (9123/88 826) in VA.

Similar regional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was observed in both populations. Patients in the West North Central region (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) had the highest participation, whereas those in the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) had the lowest participation in both Medicare (33.7% versus 10.6%) and VA (16.6% versus 5.1%) populations.

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> could affect growth in the following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different sites, indicating site effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

Invertible promoters mediate bacterial phase variation, antibiotic resistance, and host adaptation in the gut
<p>Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, the reversible alternation between genetic states, enables infection by pathogens and colonization by commensals. However, the diversity of phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion remains underexplored. We developed the PhaseFinder algorithm to quantify DNA inversion–mediated phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. A systematic search of 54,875 bacterial genomes identified 4686 intergenic invertible DNA regions (invertons), revealing an enrichment in host-associated bacteria. Invertons containing promoters often regulate extracellular products, underscoring the importance of surface diversity for gut colonization. We found invertons containing promoters regulating antibiotic resistance genes that shift to the ON orientation after antibiotic treatment in human metagenomic data and in vitro, thereby mitigating the cost of antibiotic resistance. We observed that the orientations of some invertons diverge after fecal microbiota transplant, potentially as a result of individual-specific selective forces.</p>

Metropolitan versus small-town influenza
<p>Every year, influenza epidemics occur during winter in regions with temperate climates. The duration, size, and precise timing of influenza epidemics vary from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>—the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths can be substantial. The influenza epidemic in the winter of 2017–2018 in the United States was extraordinarily severe and long, straining the health care system capacity. Various external factors have been proposed to explain the duration, size, and precise timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al influenza epidemics, including weakened immune systems during winter, increased social crowding indoors, school leave during the Christmas holiday, and the lower humidity in winter. Inferring the relative importance of each of those factors is difficult because they act on a dynamic process that responds sensitively to changes and that is only observable with a measure of error (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>). How can we determine what is driving influenza epidemics? On page 75 of this issue, Dalziel <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) demonstrate how influenza epidemics in a city are driven by fluctuations in humidity, modulated by the population size. This implies that influenza control measures could work differently in large metropolitan areas compared to small towns.</p>

A continental system for forecasting bird migration
<p>Billions of animals cross the globe each year during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al migrations, but efforts to monitor them are hampered by the unpredictability of their movements. We developed a bird migration forecast system at a continental scale by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to identify associations between atmospheric conditions and bird migration intensity. Our models explained up to 81% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in migration intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0 to 3000 meters, and performance remained high in forecasting events 1 to 7 days in advance (62 to 76% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was explained). Avian migratory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. Bird migration forecasts will reduce collisions with buildings, airplanes, and wind turbines; inform a variety of monitoring efforts; and engage the public.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time
<p>Plants integrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al signals, including temperature and day length, to optimize the timing of developmental transitions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al sensing requires the activity of two proteins, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), that control certain developmental transitions in plants. During reproductive development, the mother plant uses FLC and FT to modulate progeny seed dormancy in response to temperature. We found that for regulation of seed dormancy, <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> function in opposite configuration to how those same genes control time to flowering. For seed dormancy, FT regulates seed dormancy through <i>FLC</i> gene expression and regulates chromatin state by activating antisense <i>FLC</i> transcription. Thus, in <i>Arabidopsis</i> the same genes controlled in opposite format regulate flowering time and seed dormancy in response to the temperature changes that characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>s.</p>

Zones, spots, and planetary-scale waves beating in brown dwarf atmospheres

The infrared brightness evolution is dominated by beat patterns caused by planetary-scale wave pairs and by a small number of bright spots.

The power spectrum of intermediate-temperature brown dwarfs resembles that of Neptune, indicating the presence of zonal temperature and wind speed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions.

Precipitation drives global variation in natural selection

We report that aspects of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, along with the North Atlantic Oscillation, predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in selection across plant and animal populations throughout many terrestrial biomes, whereas temperature explained little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion.

Semiautomated Feature Extraction from RGB Images for Sorghum Panicle Architecture GWAS
<p>Because structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the inflorescence architecture of cereal crops can influence yield, it is of interest to identify the genes responsible for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. However, the manual collection of inflorescence phenotypes can be time consuming for the large populations needed to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and is difficult for multidimensional traits such as volume. A semiautomated phenotyping pipeline, TIM (Toolkit for Inflorescence Measurement), was developed and used to extract unidimensional and multidimensional features from images of 1,064 sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) panicles from 272 genotypes comprising a subset of the Sorghum Association Panel. GWAS detected 35 unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in inflorescence architecture. The accuracy of the TIM pipeline is supported by the fact that several of these trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (TASs) are located within chromosomal regions associated with similar traits in previously published quantitative trait locus and GWAS analyses of sorghum. Additionally, sorghum homologs of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes known to affect inflorescence architecture are enriched in the vicinities of TASs. Finally, our TASs are enriched within genomic regions that exhibit high levels of divergence between converted tropical lines and cultivars, consistent with the hypothesis that these chromosomal intervals were targets of selection during modern breeding.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>OsLG3</i> Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging
<p>Improving the performance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) under drought stress has the potential to significantly affect rice productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates drought tolerance in rice. In our previous work, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> has a positive effect on rice grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> was more strongly expressed in upland rice than in lowland rice under drought stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the promoter of <i>OsLG3</i> is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating rice seeds. Overexpression of <i>OsLG3</i> significantly improved the tolerance of rice plants to simulated drought, whereas suppression of <i>OsLG3</i> resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of <i>OsLG3</i> may improve drought tolerance in cultivated <i>japonica</i> rice. Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i><sup>IRAT109</sup> showed increased drought tolerance, demonstrating that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to drought tolerance in rice. Further investigation suggested that <i>OsLG3</i> plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance in rice by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging. Collectively, our findings reveal that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to rice drought tolerance and that the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i> is a promising genetic resource for the development of drought-tolerant rice varieties.</p>

The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the genetic and environmental conditioning of plant morphology are hindered by the lack of flexible and effective tools for quantifying morphology. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-homology-based topological methods can improve measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-homology-based methods can more comprehensively capture morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion; (2) these techniques discriminate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and detect a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e traits, whether statistically derived from uni<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e or persistent-homology-based traits, improve our ability to understand the genetic basis of phenotype; and (4) persistent-homology-based techniques detect unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of morphology are now detectable. The QTL results further imply that genetic contributions to morphology can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in tomato. Persistent homology is a versatile framework to quantify plant morphology and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

Thioredoxin-Mediated ROS Homeostasis Explains Natural Variation in Plant Regeneration
<p>Plant regeneration is fundamental to basic research and agricultural applications. The regeneration capacity of plants varies largely in different genotypes, but the reason for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion remains elusive. Here, we identified a novel thioredoxin DCC1 in determining the capacity of shoot regeneration among Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Loss of function of <i>DCC1</i> resulted in inhibited shoot regeneration. <i>DCC1</i> was expressed mainly in the inner tissues of the callus and encoded a functional thioredoxin that was localized in the mitochondria. DCC1 protein interacted directly with CARBONIC ANHYDRASE2 (CA2), which is an essential subunit of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I). DCC1 regulated Complex I activity via redox modification of CA2 protein. Mutation of <i>DCC1</i> or <i>CA2</i> led to reduced Complex I activity and triggered mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increased ROS level regulated shoot regeneration by repressing expression of the genes involved in multiple pathways. Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that DCC1 was a major determinant of the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in shoot regeneration among Arabidopsis ecotypes. Thus, our study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism by which thioredoxin-dependent redox modification regulates de novo shoot initiation via the modulation of ROS homeostasis and provides new insights into improving the capacity of plant regeneration.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

<p>In climates that experience short growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>s due to drought, heat, or end-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to water deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil water content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and water management drove most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette water content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-watered conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

A Photoreceptor Contributes to the Natural Variation of Diapause Induction in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
<p>Diapause is an adaptation that allows organisms to survive harsh environmental conditions. In species occurring over broad habitat ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause induction can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local adaptation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations adapt to their local environments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, diapause induction is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual reproduction, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual reproduction and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving habitat deterioration. We have previously shown that the induction of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of habitat deterioration and have identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the induction of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion observed in resting stage induction. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length perception that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al and possibly short-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in flow conditions.</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among palms from different geographical regions, but lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions of important oil palm traits.</p>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening
<p>Through natural or human selection, many fleshy fruits have evolved vivid external or internal coloration, which often develops during ripening. Such developmental changes in color are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through chlorophyll degradation. Here, we demonstrated that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit peel degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of chlorophyll degradation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of chlorophyll. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation. Taken together, these results reveal allelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion underlying an important fruit quality trait and a molecular genetic mechanism associated with apple domestication.</p>

The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by wind. The ability of leaf photosynthesis to respond rapidly to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to photosynthesis in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of photosynthesis-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a generation and under repeated drought stress over five successive generations. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with water stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf water potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil water deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf water supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions depending on the genotype. Importantly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf water status.</p>

Night-Break Experiments Shed Light on the Photoperiod1-Mediated Flowering
<p>Plants utilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in day length (photoperiod) to anticipate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes. They respond by modulating their growth and development to maximize seed production, which in cereal crops is directly related to yield. In wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the acceleration of flowering under long days (LD) is dependent on the light induction of <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>PPD1</i>) by phytochromes. Under LD, <i>PPD1</i> activates <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> (<i>FT1</i>), a mobile signaling protein that travels from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem to promote flowering. Here, we show that the interruption of long nights by short pulses of light (“night-break” [NB]) accelerates wheat flowering, suggesting that the duration of the night is critical for wheat photoperiodic response. <i>PPD1</i> transcription was rapidly upregulated by NBs, and the magnitude of this induction increased with the length of darkness preceding the NB. Cycloheximide abolished the NB up-regulation of <i>PPD1</i>, suggesting that this process is dependent on active protein synthesis during darkness. While one NB was sufficient to induce <i>PPD1</i>, more than 15 NBs were required to induce high levels of <i>FT1</i> expression and a strong acceleration of flowering. Multiple NBs did not affect the expression of core circadian clock genes. The acceleration of flowering by NB disappeared in <i>ppd1-</i>null mutants, demonstrating that this response is mediated by <i>PPD1</i>. The acceleration of flowering was strongest when NBs were applied in the middle of the night, suggesting that in addition to <i>PPD1</i>, other circadian-controlled factors are required for the up-regulation of <i>FT1</i> expression and the acceleration of flowering.</p>

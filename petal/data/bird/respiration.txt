A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resuscit</span></strong>ation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism switches from maintenance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, characterized by residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resuscit</span></strong>ation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resuscit</span></strong>ation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resuscit</span></strong>ation.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism interact to support plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation remains unclear. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathway databases for 22 species and identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ometry to determine whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects.

Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

Separating host and microbiome contributions to drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity

However, quantifying microbial contributions to drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is challenging, particularly in cases where host and microbiome perform the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic transformation. We combined gut commensal genetics with gnotobiotics to measure brivudine drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism across tissues in mice that vary in a single microbiome-encoded enzyme.

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels.

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic states throughout winter: torpor, during which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic suppression occurs under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Altered lipid homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i> InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants leads to obesity and hyperphagia
<p>Obesity is a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic disorder that often manifests with a strong genetic component in humans. However, the genetic basis for obesity and the accompanying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome is poorly defined. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic level, obesity arises from an imbalance between the nutritional intake and energy utilization of an organism. Mechanisms that sense the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic state of the individual and convey this information to satiety centers help achieve this balance. Mutations in genes that alter or modify such signaling mechanisms are likely to lead to either obese individuals, who in mammals are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or excessively thin individuals with accompanying health problems. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> mutants for an intracellular calcium signaling channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) store excess triglycerides in their fat bodies and become unnaturally obese on a normal diet. Although excess insulin signaling can rescue obesity in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants to some extent, we show that it is not the only cause of the defect. Through mass spectrometric analysis of lipids we find that homeostasis of storage and membrane lipids are altered in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants. Possibly as a compensatory mechanism, InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutant adults also feed excessively. Thus, reduced InsP<sub>3</sub>R function alters lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and causes hyperphagia in adults. Together, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic and behavioral changes lead to obesity. Our results implicate altered InsP<sub>3</sub> signaling as a previously unknown causative factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome in humans.

Breathing to inspire and arouse
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breath</span></strong>ing is one of the perpetual rhythms of life that is often taken for granted, its apparent simplicity belying the complex neural machinery involved. This behavior is more complicated than just producing inspiration, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breath</span></strong>ing is integrated with many other motor functions such as vocalization, orofacial motor behaviors, emotional expression (laughing and crying), and locomotion (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, cognition can strongly influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breath</span></strong>ing. Conscious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breath</span></strong>ing during yoga, meditation, or psychotherapy can modulate emotion, arousal state, or stress (<i>3</i>). Therefore, understanding the links between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breath</span></strong>ing behavior, brain arousal state, and higher-order brain activity is of great interest. On page 1411 of this issue, Yackle <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) identify an apparently specialized, molecularly identifiable, small subset of ∼350 neurons in the mouse brain that forms a circuit for transmitting information about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory activity to other central nervous system neurons, specifically with a group of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem, that influences arousal state (see the figure). This finding provides new insight into how the motor act of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">breath</span></strong>ing can influence higher-order brain functions.</p>

Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually darkened leaf initiates senescence much more rapidly than a leaf from a whole darkened plant. Combining transcriptomic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies that are employed in response to different darkening treatments. Under darkened plant conditions, the perception of carbon starvation drove a profound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP production. Concomitantly, the increased accumulation of amino acids with a high nitrogen-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of nitrogen for use upon returning to typical growth conditions. Conversely, in individually darkened leaf, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including sugars and amino acids, between the darkened leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shift in the substrates fueling mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic reactions facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two darkening treatments, which support either rapid senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by wind. The ability of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to respond rapidly to these variations in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl amine, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite involved in a multiplicity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter impacted mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s also feeds back to regulate the circadian oscillator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian oscillator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites. Several combinations of exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp.

Central Metabolic Responses to Ozone and Herbivory Affect Photosynthesis and Stomatal Closure
<p>Plants have evolved adaptive mechanisms that allow them to tolerate a continuous range of abiotic and biotic stressors. Tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), a global anthropogenic pollutant, directly affects living organisms and ecosystems, including plant-herbivore interactions. In this study, we investigate the stress responses of <i>Brassica nigra</i> (wild black mustard) exposed consecutively to O<sub>3</sub> and the specialist herbivore <i>Pieris brassicae</i>. Transcriptomics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics data were evaluated using multivariate, correlation, and network analyses for the O<sub>3</sub> and herbivory responses. O<sub>3</sub> stress symptoms resembled those of senescence and phosphate starvation, while a sequential shift from O<sub>3</sub> to herbivory induced characteristic plant defense responses, including a decrease in central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, induction of the jasmonic acid/ethylene pathways, and emission of volatiles. Omics network and pathway analyses predicted a link between glycerol and central energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism that influences the osmotic stress response and stomatal closure. Further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical measurements confirmed that while O<sub>3</sub> stress inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and carbon assimilation, sequential herbivory counteracted the initial responses induced by O<sub>3</sub>, resulting in a phenotype similar to that observed after herbivory alone. This study clarifies the consequences of multiple stress interactions on a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic system and also illustrates how omics data can be integrated to generate new hypotheses in ecology and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Disclosing the Molecular Basis of the Postharvest Life of Berry in Different Grapevine Genotypes
<p>The molecular events that characterize postripening grapevine berries have rarely been investigated and are poorly defined. In particular, a detailed definition of changes occurring during the postharvest dehydration, a process undertaken to make some particularly special wine styles, would be of great interest for both winemakers and plant biologists. We report an exhaustive survey of transcriptomic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic responses in berries representing six grapevine genotypes subjected to postharvest dehydration under identical controlled conditions. The modulation of phenylpropanoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The modulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism highlighted the distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-specific responses, a core set of genes was consistently modulated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing dehydration and/or commencing senescence. This included genes controlling ethylene and auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, and cell wall and carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Several transcription factors were identified that may control these shared processes in the postharvest berry. Changes representing both common and genotype-specific responses to postharvest conditions shed light on the cellular processes taking place in harvested berries stored under dehydrating conditions for several months.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Fructose-driven glycolysis supports anoxia resistance in the naked mole-rat
<p>The African naked mole-rat’s (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) social and subterranean lifestyle generates a hypoxic niche.

On the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration in Cyanobacteria

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux

Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism Impacts Triacylglycerol Homeostasis in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Nitrogen (N) starvation-induced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and its complex relationship with starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in algal cells, has been intensively studied; however, few studies have examined the interaction between amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG biosynthesis. Here, via a forward genetic screen for TAG homeostasis, we isolated a <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) mutant (<i>bkdE1α</i>) that is deficient in the E1α subunit of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analysis revealed a defect in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in <i>bkdE1α</i>. Furthermore, this mutant accumulated 30% less TAG than the parental strain during N starvation and was compromised in TAG remobilization upon N resupply. Intriguingly, the rate of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation was 20% to 35% lower in <i>bkdE1α</i> compared with the parental strains. Three additional knockout mutants of the other components of the BCKDH complex exhibited phenotypes similar to that of <i>bkdE1α</i>. Transcriptional responses of <i>BCKDH</i> to different N status were consistent with its role in TAG homeostasis. Collectively, these results indicate that branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributes to TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism by providing carbon precursors and ATP, thus highlighting the complex interplay between distinct subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>isms for oil storage in green microalgae.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic connection between Lys and serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the foundation of coral-reef ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can grow photoautotrophically, it can grow mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite normally transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and alterations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes were correlated with changes in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little change in their abundances. However, the altered carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in Glc-supplemented cells was correlated with modest alterations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes that are not reflected by major changes in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably reflect posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase Is Involved in Both, Valine and Isoleucine Degradation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>In plants, amino acid catabolism is especially relevant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic stress situations (e.g. limited carbohydrate availability during extended darkness). Under these conditions, amino acids are used as alternative substrates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Complete oxidation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) in the mitochondria efficiently allows the formation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways for BCAA breakdown are largely unknown so far in plants. A systematic search for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes encoding proteins resembling enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in animals, fungi, and bacteria as well as proteomic analyses of mitochondrial fractions from Arabidopsis allowed the identification of a putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, AtHDH1 (At4g20930), involved in Val degradation. Systematic substrate screening analyses revealed that the protein uses 3-hydroxyisobutyrate but additionally 3-hydroxypropionate as substrates. This points to a role of the enzyme not only in Val but possibly also in Ile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. At4g20930 knockdown plants were characterized to test this conclusion. Root toxicity assays revealed increased root growth inhibition of the mutants if cultivated in the presence of Val or Ile but not in the presence of leucine. We conclude that AtHDH1 has a dual role in BCAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in plants.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of methionine (Met) in seeds. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) seeds with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these seeds accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control seeds through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their seeds at late stages of development. Seed-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi seeds triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the seeds, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rearrangements in RNAi seeds resulted in an altered sulfur-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between seeds and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y and behavior.</p>

Acclimation to High CO<sub>2</sub> Requires the <i>ω</i> Subunit of the RNA Polymerase in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Inactivation of the nonessential ω-subunit of the RNA polymerase core in the ΔrpoZ strain of the model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 leads to a unique high-CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive phenotype. Supplementing air in the growth chamber with 30 mL L<sup>−1</sup> (3%) CO<sub>2</sub> accelerated the growth rate of the control strain (CS) 4-fold, whereas ΔrpoZ did not grow faster than under ambient air. The slow growth of ΔrpoZ during the first days in high CO<sub>2</sub> was due to the inability of the mutant cells to adjust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to high CO<sub>2</sub>. The light-saturated photosynthetic activity of ΔrpoZ in high CO<sub>2</sub> was only half of that measured in CS, Rubisco content was one-third lower, and cells of ΔrpoZ were not able to increase light-harvesting phycobilisome antenna like CS upon high-CO<sub>2</sub> treatment. In addition, altered structural and functional organization of photosystem I and photosystem II were detected in the ΔrpoZ strain compared with CS when cells were grown in high CO<sub>2</sub> but not in ambient air. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation of ΔrpoZ did not acclimate to high CO<sub>2</sub>. Unlike the photosynthetic complexes, the RNA polymerase complex and ribosomes were produced in high CO<sub>2</sub> similarly as in CS. Our results indicate that the deletion of the ω-subunit specifically affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, but transcription and translation remain active. Thus, the specific effect of the ω-subunit on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s but not on all household processes suggests that the ω-subunit might have a regulatory function in cyanobacteria.</p>

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-Carotene adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-carotene accumulation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases carotenoid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-carotene levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux in melon fruit, as shown by carotenoid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-carotene accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of β-carotene. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i>carotenoid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a carotenoid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants accumulated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast formation and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein levels to maintain carotenoid biosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism downstream of β-carotene to dramatically affect both carotenoid content and plastid fate.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s are profoundly different, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites showed dynamic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms (including plant pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with plants) promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, growth, and the accumulation of high levels of starch in leaves through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants not exposed to VCs, plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and growth, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of plastidic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in leaves. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of plants to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis plants cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and the accumulation of plastidic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves accumulated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, and growth that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> plants.

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y and behaviour.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and function.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-195 Regulates Metabolism in Failing Myocardium Via Alterations in Sirtuin 3 Expression and Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic abnormalities of the failing myocardium coupled with an energy-depleted state and cardiac remodeling. The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in rodent models of SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup>and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3′-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA–mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation.SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup> and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.</p></sec>

Inhibition of MicroRNA-146a and Overexpression of Its Target Dihydrolipoyl Succinyltransferase Protect Against Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy and Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases remain the predominant cause of death worldwide, with the prevalence of heart failure continuing to increase. Despite increased knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic alterations that occur in heart failure, novel therapies to treat the observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic disturbances are still lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mice were subjected to pressure overload by means of angiotensin-II infusion or transversal aortic constriction. MicroRNA-146a was either genetically or pharmacologically knocked out or genetically overexpressed in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) in the murine heart was performed by means of an adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MicroRNA-146a was upregulated in whole heart tissue in multiple murine pressure overload models. Also, microRNA-146a levels were moderately increased in left ventricular biopsies of patients with aortic stenosis. Overexpression of microRNA-146a in cardiomyocytes provoked cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in vivo, whereas genetic knockdown or pharmacological blockade of microRNA-146a blunted the hypertrophic response and attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-146a reduced its target DLST—the E2 subcomponent of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, a rate-controlling tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. DLST protein levels significantly decreased on pressure overload in wild-type mice, paralleling a decreased oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, whereas DLST protein levels and hence oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were partially maintained in microRNA-146a knockout mice. Moreover, overexpression of DLST in wild-type mice protected against cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Altogether we show that the microRNA-146a and its target DLST are important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic players in left ventricular dysfunction.</p></sec>

Tryptophan-Derived 3-Hydroxyanthranilic Acid Contributes to Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Formation in Mice In Vivo
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abnormal amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is associated with vascular disease. However, the causative link between dysregulated tryptophan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Mice with deficiencies in both apolipoprotein e (Apoe) and IDO (Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup>) were generated by cross-breeding IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice with Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The acute infusion of angiotensin II markedly increased the incidence of AAA in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice, which presented decreased elastic lamina degradation and aortic expansion. These features were not altered by the reconstitution of bone marrow cells from IDO<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Moreover, angiotensin II infusion instigated interferon-γ, which induced the expression of IDO and kynureninase and increased 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) levels in the plasma and aortas of Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Both IDO and kynureninase controlled the production of 3-HAA in vascular smooth muscle cells. 3-HAA upregulated matrix metallopeptidase 2 via transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, kynureninase knockdown in mice restrained 3-HAA, matrix metallopeptidase 2, and resultant AAA formation by angiotensin II infusion. Intraperitoneal injections of 3-HAA into Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> and Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice for 6 weeks increased the expression and activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 in aortas without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic parameters. Finally, human AAA samples had stronger staining with the antibodies against 3-HAA, IDO, and kynureninase than those in adjacent nonaneurysmal aortic sections of human AAA samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data define a previously undescribed causative role for 3-HAA, which is a product of tryptophan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, in AAA formation. Furthermore, these findings suggest that 3-HAA reduction may be a new target for treating cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec>

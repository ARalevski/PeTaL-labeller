Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e and metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, substrate, product, and potential regulator concentrations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate concentrations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite concentrations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es that modify the scaffold (tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme
<p>Multielectron redox reactions often require multicofactor metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es to facilitate coupled electron and proton movement, but it is challenging to design artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es to catalyze these important reactions, owing to their structural and functional complexity. We report a designed heteronuclear heme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor in cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase as a structural and functional model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e sulfite reductase. The initial model exhibits spectroscopic and ligand-binding properties of the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, and sulfite reduction activity was improved—through rational tuning of the secondary sphere interactions around the [4Fe-4S] and the substrate-binding sites—to be close to that of the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e. By offering insight into the requirements for a demanding six-electron, seven-proton reaction that has so far eluded synthetic catalysts, this study provides strategies for designing highly functional multicofactor artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es.</p>

An artificial metalloenzyme with the kinetics of native enzymes
<p>Natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es contain highly evolved active sites that lead to fast rates and high selectivities. Although artificial metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es have been developed that catalyze abiological transformations with high stereoselectivity, the activities of these artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es are much lower than those of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Here, we report a reconstituted artificial metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e containing an iridium porphyrin that exhibits kinetic parameters similar to those of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. In particular, variants of the P450 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e CYP119 containing iridium in place of iron catalyze insertions of carbenes into C–H bonds with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, 35,000 turnovers, and 2550 hours<sup>−1</sup> turnover frequency. This activity leads to intramolecular carbene insertions into unactivated C–H bonds and intermolecular carbene insertions into C–H bonds. These results lift the restrictions on merging chemical catalysis and biocatalysis to create highly active, productive, and selective metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es for abiological reactions.</p>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that cleaves a carbon-sulfur (C–S) bond in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-carbon (Fe–C) bond between ACP and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es reveal that the carbon of the SAM C–S bond being cleaved is positioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster. Our results explain how selective C–S bond cleavage is achieved in this radical SAM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e.</p>

A prominent glycyl radical enzyme in human gut microbiomes metabolizes <i>trans</i>-4-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-proline

An N-end rule pathway that recognizes proline and destroys gluconeogenic enzymes
<p>Cells synthesize glucose if deprived of it, and destroy gluconeogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es upon return to glucose-replete conditions. We found that the Gid4 subunit of the ubiquitin ligase GID in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> targeted the gluconeogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es Fbp1, Icl1, and Mdh2 for degradation. Gid4 recognized the N-terminal proline (Pro) residue and the ~5-residue-long adjacent sequence motifs.

Evolutionary drivers of thermoadaptation in enzyme catalysis

Here we characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying thermoadaptation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e catalysis in adenylate kinase using ancestral sequence reconstruction spanning 3 billion years of evolution. We show that evolution solved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e’s key kinetic obstacle—how to maintain catalytic speed on a cooler Earth—by exploiting transition-state heat capacity. Tracing the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activity and stability from the hot-start toward modern hyperthermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic organisms illustrates active pressure versus passive drift in evolution on a molecular level, refutes the debated activity/stability trade-off, and suggests that the catalytic speed of adenylate kinase is an evolutionary driver for organismal fitness.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic acid or its modified form, pyrethric acid, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic acid. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic acid, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the acid have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic acid. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic acid as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic acid was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate immunity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>atically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host immunity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host immunity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered immunity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant immunity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant immunity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host immunity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es (UBE) and deubiquitinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme
<p>Embryos of medaka <i>Oryzias latipes</i> hatch in freshwater, while those of killifish <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> hatch in brackish water. Medaka and <i>Fundulus</i> possess two kinds of hatching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, high choriolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e (HCE) and low choriolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e (LCE), which cooperatively digest their egg envelope at the time of hatching. Optimal salinity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two <i>Fundulus</i> HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each salinity at the time of hatching. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope digestion in various salinities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single site at position 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Superimposition of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that position 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active site cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that position 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with recognition of primary structure around the cleavage site, but with recognition of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein.</p>

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up.

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of lipid A are chemically modified by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that adds an additional phosphate group to lipid A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin
<p>Oxygen is essential for the life of most multicellular organisms. Cells possess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es called molecular dioxygenases that depend on oxygen for activity. A subclass of molecular dioxygenases is the histone demethylase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor–independent induction of histone methylation in a range of human cultured cells. Genomic locations of histone-3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3 after a brief exposure of cultured cells to hypoxia predict the cell’s transcriptional response several hours later. We show that inactivation of one of the JmjC-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A), mimics hypoxia-induced cellular responses. These results demonstrate that oxygen sensing by chromatin occurs via JmjC-histone demethylase inhibition.</p>

A synthetic pathway for the fixation of carbon dioxide in vitro
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is an important carbon feedstock for a future green economy. This requires the development of efficient strategies for its conversion into multicarbon compounds. We describe a synthetic cycle for the continuous fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> in vitro. The crotonyl–co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e A (CoA)/ethylmalonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA (CETCH) cycle is a reaction network of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es that converts CO<sub>2</sub> into organic molecules at a rate of 5 nanomoles of CO<sub>2</sub> per minute per milligram of protein. The CETCH cycle was drafted by metabolic retrosynthesis, established with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es originating from nine different organisms of all three domains of life, and optimized in several rounds by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e engineering and metabolic proofreading. The CETCH cycle adds a seventh, synthetic alternative to the six naturally evolved CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathways, thereby opening the way for in vitro and in vivo applications.</p>

The biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme F430 in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea
<p>Methyl-co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e M reductase (MCR) is the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e of methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation. The activity of MCR is dependent on the unique nickel-containing tetrapyrrole known as co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e F430. We used comparative genomics to identify the co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e F430 biosynthesis (<i>cfb</i>) genes and characterized the encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es from <i>Methanosarcina acetivorans</i> C2A. The pathway involves nickelochelation by a nickel-specific chelatase, followed by amidation to form Ni-sirohydrochlorin <i>a</i>,<i>c</i>-diamide. Next, a primitive homolog of nitrogenase mediates a six-electron reduction and γ-lactamization reaction before a Mur ligase homolog forms the six-membered carbocyclic ring in the final step of the pathway. These data show that co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e F430 can be synthesized from sirohydrochlorin using Cfb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es produced heterologously in a nonmethanogen host and identify several targets for inhibitors of biological methane formation.</p>

Roles of RbcX in Carboxysome Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942
<p>Rubisco is the essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e mediating the fixation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during photosynthesis. In cyanobacteria, Rubisco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es are densely packed and encapsulated in a specialized organelle known as the carboxysome. Well-defined Rubisco assembly and carboxysome formation are pivotal for efficient CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Numerous chaperone proteins, including RbcX, are essential for proper protein folding and Rubisco assembly. In this study, we investigated the in vivo function of RbcX in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942 (Syn7942) using molecular, biochemical, and live-cell fluorescence imaging approaches. Our results show that genetic deletion of the <i>rbcX</i> gene affects Rubisco abundance, as well as carboxysome formation and spatial distribution. Moreover, RbcX appears as one component of the carboxysome and shows a dynamic interaction with Rubisco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. These in vivo observations provide insight into the role of RbcX from Syn7942 in mediating carboxysome assembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying Rubisco assembly and carboxysome biogenesis will provide essential information required for engineering functional CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing complexes in heterogeneous organisms, especially plants, with the aim of boosting photosynthesis and agricultural productivity.</p>

Elucidation of the Amygdalin Pathway Reveals the Metabolic Basis of Bitter and Sweet Almonds (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>)
<p>Almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) is the principal <i>Prunus</i> species in which the consumed and thus commercially important part of the fruit is the kernel. As a result of continued selection, the vast majority of almonds have a nonbitter kernel. However, in the field, there are trees carrying bitter kernels, which are toxic to humans and, consequently, need to be removed. The toxicity of bitter almonds is caused by the accumulation of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin, which releases toxic hydrogen cyanide upon hydrolysis. In this study, we identified and characterized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es involved in the amygdalin biosynthetic pathway: PdCYP79D16 and PdCYP71AN24 as the cytochrome P450 (CYP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es catalyzing phenylalanine-to-mandelonitrile conversion, PdUGT94AF3 as an additional monoglucosyl transferase (UGT) catalyzing prunasin formation, and PdUGT94AF1 and PdUGT94AF2 as the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es catalyzing amygdalin formation from prunasin. This was accomplished by constructing a sequence database containing UGTs known, or predicted, to catalyze a β(1→6)-<i>O</i>-glycosylation reaction and a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search of the draft version of the almond genome versus these sequences. Functional characterization of candidate genes was achieved by transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the expression of <i>PdCYP79D16</i> and <i>PdCYP71AN24</i> was not detectable or only reached minute levels in the sweet almond genotype during fruit development, while it was high and consistent in the bitter genotype. Therefore, the basis for the sweet kernel phenotype is a lack of expression of the genes encoding the two CYPs catalyzing the first steps in amygdalin biosynthesis.</p>

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Phosphate starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type phosphatases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the induction of molecular markers related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the phosphate starvation response.</p>

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a program exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a program is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis
<p>The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) plays essential roles in biotic and abiotic responses, plant development, and leaf senescence. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA or gentisic acid) is one of the most commonly occurring aromatic acids in green plants and is assumed to be generated from SA, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es involved in its production remain obscure. DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in plant immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of DMR6 as a salicylic acid 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the formation of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 position of its phenyl ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibition property that may enable automatic control of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display phenotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing plants, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages. Collectively, our results disclose the identity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e required for 2,5-DHBA formation and reveal a mechanism by which plants fine-tune SA homeostasis by mediating SA 5-hydroxylation.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

The C-Domain of Oleuropein <i>β</i>-Glucosidase Assists in Protein Folding and Sequesters the Enzyme in Nucleus<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Oleuropein, a terpene-derived glycosylated secoiridoid biosynthesized exclusively by members of the Oleaceae family, is involved in a two-component defense system comprising a β-glucosidase that activates oleuropein into a toxic glutaraldehyde-like structure. Oleuropein and its deglycosylated derivatives have high pharmaceutical interest. In this study we determined that the in planta heterologous expressed OeGLU, an oleuropein-specific β-glucosidase from olive (<i>Olea europaea</i>), had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>atic kinetics similar to the olive native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e. The C terminus encompassing the nuclear localization signal sequesters the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e in the nucleus, and predetermines the protein-protein recognition and homodimerization. Biochemical analysis revealed that OeGLU is a homomultimer with high <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>. In silico prediction modeling of the complex structure and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses revealed that the C terminus of OeGLU is essential for the proper assembly of an octameric form, a key conformational feature that determines the activity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic characteristics of the OeGLU ensure separation from oleuropein and keep the dual-partner defensive system conditionally inactive. Upon cell destruction, the dual-partner defense system is activated and olive massively releases the arsenal of defense.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These seed oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es to generate 10:0-rich seed oils.</p>

The α-Terpineol to 1,8-Cineole Cyclization Reaction of Tobacco Terpene Synthases
<p>Flowers of <i>Nicotiana</i> species emit a characteristic blend including the cineole cassette monoterpenes. This set of terpenes is synthesized by multiproduct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, with either 1,8-cineole or α-terpineol contributing most to the volatile spectrum, thus referring to cineole or terpineol synthase, respectively. To understand the molecular and structural requirements of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es that favor the biochemical formation of α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole, site-directed mutagenesis, in silico modeling, and semiempiric calculations were performed. Our results indicate the formation of α-terpineol by a nucleophilic attack of water. During this attack, the α-terpinyl cation is stabilized by π-stacking with a tryptophan side chain (tryptophan-253). The hypothesized catalytic mechanism of α-terpineol-to-1,8-cineole conversion is initiated by a catalytic dyad (histidine-502 and glutamate-249), acting as a base, and a threonine (threonine-278) providing the subsequent rearrangement from terpineol to cineol by catalyzing the autoprotonation of (<i>S</i>)-(−)-α-terpineol, which is the favored enantiomer product of the recombinant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to identify amino acids at positions 147, 148, and 266 that determine the different terpineol-cineole ratios in <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>suaveolens</i> cineole synthase and <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>langsdorffii</i> terpineol synthase. Since amino acid 266 is more than 10 ÅÅ away from the active site, an indirect effect of this amino acid exchange on the catalysis is discussed.</p>

A Single Arabidopsis Gene Encodes Two Differentially Targeted Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase Isoforms
<p>A wide diversity of isoprenoids is produced in different plant compartments. Most groups of isoprenoids synthesized in plastids, and some produced elsewhere in the plant cell derive from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthesized by GGPP synthase (GGPPS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), five genes appear to encode GGPPS isoforms localized in plastids (two), the endoplasmic reticulum (two), and mitochondria (one). However, the loss of function of the plastid-targeted GGPPS11 isoform (referred to as G11) is sufficient to cause lethality. Here, we show that the absence of a strong transcription initiation site in the <i>G11</i> gene results in the production of transcripts of different lengths. The longer transcripts encode an isoform with a functional plastid import sequence that produces GGPP for the major groups of photosynthesis-related plastidial isoprenoids. However, shorter transcripts are also produced that lack the first translation initiation codon and rely on a second in-frame ATG codon to produce an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>atically active isoform lacking this N-terminal domain. This short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e localizes in the cytosol and is essential for embryo development. Our results confirm that the production of differentially targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e isoforms from the same gene is a central mechanism to control the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors in different plant cell compartments.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Activation of the cnidarian oxidative stress response by ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil
<p>Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive chemicals capable of causing oxidative stress and cellular damage. Antioxidant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of neutralizing such oxidants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of antioxidant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es (transcript expression, protein expression and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>atic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity tests, juvenile <i>N. vectensis</i> showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult <i>N. vectensis</i> exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo[a]pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. Antioxidant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure. Expression patterns were most strongly affected by UV exposure but varied between experiments, suggesting that responses vary according to the intensity and duration of exposure. These experiments provide a basis for comparison with other cnidarian taxa and for further studies of the oxidative stress response in <i>N. vectensis.</i></p>

Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth–Activated XBP1 Splicing in Endothelial Cells Is Crucial for Angiogenesis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Vascular endothelial cell growth factor plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis via regulating endothelial cell proliferation. The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is believed to be a signal transducer in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. It is unknown whether there is crosstalk between vascular endothelial cell growth factor signaling and XBP1 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We found that vascular endothelial cell growth factor induced the kinase insert domain receptor internalization and interaction through C-terminal domain with the unspliced XBP1 and the inositol requiring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e 1 α in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to inositol requiring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e 1 α phosphorylation and XBP1 mRNA splicing, which was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of kinase insert domain receptor. Spliced XBP1 regulated endothelial cell proliferation in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–dependent manner and modulated the cell size increase in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–independent manner. Knockdown of XBP1 or inositol requiring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e 1 α decreased endothelial cell proliferation via suppression of Akt/GSK3β phosphorylation, β-catenin nuclear translocation, and E2F2 expression. Endothelial cell–specific knockout of XBP1 (<i>XBP1ecko</i>) in mice retarded the retinal vasculogenesis in the first 2 postnatal weeks and impaired the angiogenesis triggered by ischemia. Reconstitution of XBP1 by Ad-XBP1s gene transfer significantly improved angiogenesis in ischemic tissue in <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice. Transplantation of bone marrow from wild-type o <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice could also slightly improve the foot blood reperfusion in ischemic <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>These results suggest that XBP1 can function via growth factor signaling pathways to regulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis.</p></sec>

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

ROS1-Dependent DNA Demethylation Is Required for ABA-Inducible <i>NIC3</i> Expression
<p>DNA methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of DNA methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. DNA demethylation is a reverse process of DNA methylation and often induces structural changes of chromatin leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana)</i>, active DNA demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from DNA. Here we showed that <i>ros1</i> mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible genes were decreased in <i>ros1</i> mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible genes are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent DNA demethylation. Notable among them is <i>NICOTINAMIDASE 3</i> (<i>NIC3</i>) that encodes an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The <i>nic3</i> mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of <i>NIC3</i> restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that <i>NIC3</i> is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation at the promoter as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active DNA demethylation maintains the active state of <i>NIC3</i> transcription in response to ABA.</p>

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p>Plastid isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes carotenoids, chlorophylls, tocopherols, and multiple hormones, are essential for plant growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i>SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that functions in the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

Characterization of CRISPR Mutants Targeting Genes Modulating Pectin Degradation in Ripening Tomato
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a globally important crop with an economic value in the tens of billions of dollars, and a significant supplier of essential vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals in the human diet. Shelf life is a key quality trait related to alterations in cuticle properties and remodeling of the fruit cell walls. Studies with transgenic tomato plants undertaken over the last 20 years have indicated that a range of pectin-degrading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es are involved in cell wall remodeling. These studies usually involved silencing of only a single gene and it has proved difficult to compare the effects of silencing these genes across the different experimental systems. Here we report the generation of CRISPR-based mutants in the ripening-related genes encoding the pectin-degrading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es pectate lyase (PL), polygalacturonase 2a (PG2a), and β-galactanase (TBG4). Comparison of the physiochemical properties of the fruits from a range of <i>PL</i>, <i>PG2a</i>, and <i>TBG4</i> CRISPR lines demonstrated that only mutations in <i>PL</i> resulted in firmer fruits, although mutations in <i>PG2a</i> and <i>TBG4</i> influenced fruit color and weight. Pectin localization, distribution, and solubility in the pericarp cells of the CRISPR mutant fruits were investigated using the monoclonal antibody probes LM19 to deesterified homogalacturonan, INRA-RU1 to rhamnogalacturonan I, LM5 to β-1,4-galactan, and LM6 to arabinan epitopes, respectively. The data indicate that PL, PG2a, and TBG4 act on separate cell wall domains and the importance of cellulose microfibril-associated pectin is reflected in its increased occurrence in the different mutant lines.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants integrate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

Reconfigured Cyanogenic Glucoside Biosynthesis in <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> Involves a Cytochrome P450 CYP706C55
<p>Cyanogenic glucosides are a class of specialized metabolites widespread in the plant kingdom. Cyanogenic glucosides are α-hydroxynitriles, and their hydrolysis releases toxic hydrogen cyanide, providing an effective chemical defense against herbivores. <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> is a cyanogenic tree, allocating up to 20% of leaf nitrogen to the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic monoglucoside, prunasin. Here, mass spectrometry analyses of <i>E. cladocalyx</i> tissues revealed spatial and ontogenetic variations in prunasin content, as well as the presence of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin in flower buds and flowers. The identification and biochemical characterization of the prunasin biosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es revealed a unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e configuration for prunasin production in <i>E. cladocalyx</i>. This result indicates that a multifunctional cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP79A125, catalyzes the initial conversion of <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine into its corresponding aldoxime, phenylacetaldoxime; a function consistent with other members of the CYP79 family. In contrast to the single multifunctional CYP known from other plant species, the conversion of phenylacetaldoxime to the α-hydroxynitrile, mandelonitrile, is catalyzed by two distinct CYPs. CYP706C55 catalyzes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime, an unusual CYP reaction. The resulting phenylacetonitrile is subsequently hydroxylatedby CYP71B103 to form mandelonitrile. The final glucosylation step to yield prunasin is catalyzed by a UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT85A59. Members of the CYP706 family have not been reported previously to participate in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, and the pathway structure in <i>E. cladocalyx</i> represents an example of convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides in plants.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic acid, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via oxidative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic acid. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic acid is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic acid is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic acid accumulates. In addition, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic acid from orsellinic acid and farnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic acid biosynthesis. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e strictly preferred orsellinic acid as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic acid. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic acid synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein interaction network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway interactions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring interactions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these interactions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their interactions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 protein levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify proteins that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) protein family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB proteins have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for protein complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 protein levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated protein PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity.

Gene Regulation and Survival under Hypoxia Requires Starch Availability and Metabolism
<p>Plants respond to hypoxia, often caused by submergence, by expressing a specific set of genes that contribute to acclimation to this unfavorable environmental condition. Genes induced by low oxygen include those encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es for carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, pathways that are required for survival. Sugar availability is therefore of crucial importance for energy production under hypoxia. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants require starch for surviving submergence as well as for ensuring the rapid induction of genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es required for anaerobic metabolism. The starchless <i>pgm</i> mutant is highly susceptible to submergence and also fails to induce anaerobic genes at the level of the wild type. Treating wild-type plants under conditions inducing sugar starvation results in a weak induction of alcohol dehydrogenase and other anaerobic genes. Induction of gene expression under hypoxia requires transcription factors belonging to group VII ethylene response factors (ERF-VII) that, together with plant Cys oxidases, act as an oxygen-sensing mechanism. We show that repression of this pathway by sugar starvation occurs downstream of the hypoxia-dependent stabilization of ERF-VII proteins and independently of the energy sensor protein kinases SnRK1.1 (SNF1-related kinase 1.1).</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors

The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-terminal domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a folded segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric site revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil fragment. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation. Based on these results, a model is proposed illustrating the role of the N-terminal domain of BnaDGAT1 as a positive and negative modulator of TAG biosynthesis.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>

Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S.

The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Phylogeny-Based Systematization of Arabidopsis Proteins with Histone H1 Globular Domain
<p>H1 (or linker) histones are basic nuclear proteins that possess an evolutionarily conserved nucleosome-binding globular domain, GH1. They perform critical functions in determining the accessibility of chromatin DNA to trans-acting factors. In most metazoan species studied so far, linker histones are highly heterogenous, with numerous nonallelic variants cooccurring in the same cells. The phylogenetic relationships among these variants as well as their structural and functional properties have been relatively well established. This contrasts markedly with the rather limited knowledge concerning the phylogeny and structural and functional roles of an unusually diverse group of GH1-containing proteins in plants. The dearth of information and the lack of a coherent phylogeny-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nomenclatur</span></strong>e of these proteins can lead to misunderstandings regarding their identity and possible relationships, thereby hampering plant chromatin research. Based on published data and our in silico and high-throughput analyses, we propose a systematization and coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nomenclatur</span></strong>e of GH1-containing proteins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> [L.] Heynh) that will be useful for both the identification and structural and functional characterization of homologous proteins from other plant species.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abbrevi</span></strong>ated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abbrevi</span></strong>ated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Evolution of Ancient Functions in the Vertebrate Insulin-Like Growth Factor System Uncovered by Study of Duplicated Salmonid Fish Genomes
<p>Whole-genome duplication (WGD) was experienced twice by the vertebrate ancestor (2 rounds; 2R), again by the teleost fish ancestor (3R) and most recently in certain teleost lineages (4R). Consequently, vertebrate gene families are often expanded in 3R and 4R genomes. Arguably, many types of “functional divergence” present across 2R gene families will exceed that between 3R/4R paralogs of genes comprising 2R families. Accordingly, 4R offers a form of replication of 2R. Examining whether this concept has implications for molecular evolutionary research, we studied insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs), whose six 2R family members carry IGF hormones and regulate interactions between IGFs and IGF1-receptors (IGF1Rs). Using phylogenomic approaches, we resolved the complete IGFBP repertoire of 4R-derived salmonid fishes (19 genes; 13 more than human) and established evolutionary relationships/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nomenclatur</span></strong>e with respect to WGDs. Traits central to IGFBP action were determined for all genes, including atomic interactions in IGFBP–IGF1/IGF2 complexes regulating IGF–IGF1R binding. Using statistical methods, we demonstrate that attributes of these protein interfaces are overwhelming a product of 2R IGFBP family membership, explain 49–68% of variation in <i>IGFBP</i> mRNA concentration in several different tissues, and strongly predict the strength and direction of <i>IGFBP</i> transcriptional regulation under differing nutritional states. The results support a model where vertebrate IGFBP family members evolved divergent structural attributes to provide distinct competition for IGFs with IGF1Rs, predisposing different functions in the regulation of IGF signaling. Evolution of gene expression then acted to ensure the appropriate physiological production of IGFBPs according to their structural specializations, leading to optimal IGF-signaling according to nutritional-status and the endocrine/local mode of action. This study demonstrates that relatively recent gene family expansion can facilitate inference of functional evolution within ancient genetic systems.</p>

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic fractures leads to a reduced mortality.   We used the Japan Trauma Data Bank database to identify isolated   unstable pelvic ring fractures to exclude the possibility of blood   loss from other injuries, and analyzed the effectiveness of EF on   mortality in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a registry-based comparison of 1163 patients who had   been treated for an isolated unstable pelvic ring fracture with   (386 patients) or without (777 patients) EF. An isolated pelvic   ring fracture was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other injuries of < 3. An unstable pelvic ring fracture was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A subgroup analysis was carried out for patients who required blood   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive blood loss (AIS code: 852610.5). Propensity-score   matching was used to identify a cohort like the EF and non-EF groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the use of propensity-score matching using the completed   data, 346 patients were matched. When the propensity-score matching   was adjusted, EF was associated with a significantly lower risk   of death (p = 0.047). In the subgroup analysis of patients who needed   blood transfusion within 24 hours and those who had massive blood loss,   EF was associated with a significantly lower risk of death in patients   who needed blood transfusion within 24 hours (p = 0.014) and in   those with massive blood loss (p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of EF to treat unstable pelvic ring fractures was associated   with a significantly lower risk of death, especially in patients   with severe fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:233–41.</p></sec>

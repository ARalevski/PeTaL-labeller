Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e rates and modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64). There   were 64 Mode 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (6.3%) at a mean of 3.2 years following   JPSH with a mean patient age of 46.8 years (18 to 64). There were   17 Mode 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (1.7%) at a mean of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a mean patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 Mode 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (1.9%) at a mean of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a mean patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO). There were 4   Mode 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (0.4%) at a mean of 1.8 years post-JPSH with a mean   patient age of 31.5 years (15 to 43).

Standardisation of the modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e may help identify the best   practice. Application of these modes to large clinical series, such   as registries, will assist in further establishing how to improve   the efficacy of JPSH.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:303–9.</p></sec>

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial genetic basis. Identification of individuals at greatest AF risk could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether genetic data can stratify risk for development of AF, we examined associations between AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical risk factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s varied across studies and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic risk was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF risk factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF genetic risk was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Efforts are warranted to determine whether AF genetic risk may improve identification of subclinical AF or help distinguish between stroke mechanisms.</p></sec>

Performance and Validation of a Novel Biomarker-Based Stroke Risk Score for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased but variable risk of stroke. Our aim was to validate the recently developed biomarker-based ABC (age, biomarkers [high-sensitivity troponin and N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide], and clinical history of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack)-stroke risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> and compare its performance with the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ABC-stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> includes age, biomarkers (N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin), and clinical history (prior stroke). This validation was based on 8356 patients, 16 137 person-years of follow-up, and 219 adjudicated stroke or systemic embolic events in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation in the RE-LY study (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy). Levels of N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were determined in plasma samples obtained at study entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The ABC-stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was well calibrated with 0.76 stroke/systemic embolic events per 100 person-years in the predefined low (<1%/y) risk group, 1.48 in the medium (1%–2%/y) risk group, and 2.60 in the high (>2%/y) risk group for the ABC-stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> with hs-cTnT. Hazard ratios for stroke/systemic embolic events were 1.95 for medium- versus low-risk groups, and 3.44 for high- versus low-risk groups.

Obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates bacterial surface sensing
<p>It is critical for bacteria to recognize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact and initiate physiological changes required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-associated lifestyles. Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in sensing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and facilitating downstream behaviors, but the mechanism by which pili mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing has been unclear. We visualized <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> pili undergoing dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact, these cycles ceased, which coincided with synthesis of the adhesive holdfast required for attachment. Physically blocking pili imposed resistance to pilus retraction, which was sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact. Thus, to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, bacteria use the resistance on retracting, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-bound pili that occurs upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-active molecules that can lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as well as insoluble lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants. Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants showed strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e activity that reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>d separately. The sum of the individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s from the   three zones is reported as a total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s: in those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-operative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism risk) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we calculated risks based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> to calculate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute risk of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> >5). The risk ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke risk. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a risk modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc risk component modifies and accentuates stroke risk in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke risk factors.</p></sec>

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s, assuming that those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s translate to fixed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke rate >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke rates below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke rates between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke rates >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke rates and rates corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s.

Weight Loss and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Associations of obesity with incidence of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e have been observed, but the causality is uncertain.

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (30%), battery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (19%), or patient cable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device malfunction is much broader than pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

Identifying Patients at Risk for Prehospital Sudden Cardiac Arrest at the Early Phase of Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital mortality of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has decreased drastically. In contrast, prehospital mortality from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains high and difficult to reduce. Identification of the patients with STEMI at higher risk for prehospital SCA could facilitate rapid triage and intervention in the field.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a prospective, population-based study evaluating all patients with STEMI managed by emergency medical services in the greater Paris area (11.7 million inhabitants) between 2006 and 2010, we identified characteristics associated with an increased risk of prehospital SCA and used these variables to build an SCA prediction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, which we validated internally and externally.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the overall STEMI population (n=8112; median age, 60 years; 78% male), SCA occurred in 452 patients (5.6%). In multivariate analysis, younger age, absence of obesity, absence of diabetes mellitus, shortness of breath, and a short delay between pain onset and call to emergency medical services were the main predictors of SCA. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> built from these variables predicted SCA, with the risk increasing 2-fold in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> between 10 and 19, 4-fold in those with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> between 20 and 29, and >18-fold in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥30 compared with those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s <10. The SCA rate was 28.9% in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥30 compared with 1.6% in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≤9 (<i>P</i> for trend <0.001). The area under the curve values were 0.7033 in the internal validation sample and 0.6031 in the external validation sample. Sensitivity and specificity varied between 96.9% and 10.5% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s ≥10 and between 18.0% and 97.6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s ≥30, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s between 20 and 29 achieving the best sensitivity and specificity (65.4% and 62.6%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At the early phase of STEMI, the risk of prehospital SCA can be determined through a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 5 routinely assessed predictors. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> might help optimize the dispatching and management of patients with STEMI by emergency medical services.</p></sec>

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to derive and validate a novel risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> for early right-sided heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (RHF) after left ventricular assist device implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation with mainstream devices. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into derivation (n=2000) and validation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. A risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression model coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, likelihood ratio test, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hemoglobin) was created. The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s in the derivation and validation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32).

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades.

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e abundance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was abundant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc abundance at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst geometries. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms lead to tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet thickness. Atomic-level control of thickness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

PINK1-Phosphorylated Mitofusin 2 Is a Parkin Receptor for Culling Damaged Mitochondria
<sec><title>Where Parkin Parks</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed mitochondria are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>ed from cells in a process known as mitophagy. Failure of this quality-control mechanism contributes to Parkinson's disease. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed mitochondria lose membrane depolarization, the protein kinase, PINK1, accumulates on the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e, recruits Parkin, and promotes mitophagy. <bold>Chen and Dorn</bold> (p. 471) describe another component of this process, mitofusin 2, which appears to function as the receptor for Parkin on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed mitochondria.</p></sec>

No difference in time-dependent improvement in functional outcome following closing wedge <i>versus</i> opening wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomised study was to compare the   time course of clinical improvement during the first two years following   a closing or opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). It was hypothesised   that there would be no differences in clinical outcome between the   two techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2007 and 2013, 70 consecutive patients were randomly   allocated to undergo either a closing or opening wedge HTO. All   patients had medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA), and were aged   between 30 years and 60 years. They were evaluated by independent   investigators pre-operatively and at three and six months, and one   and two years post-operatively using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis   Outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (KOOS), the Oxford Knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (OKS), the Lysholm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>,   the Tegner activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, the University of California, Los Angeles   (UCLA) activity scale and range of movement (ROM).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences at any time between the   two techniques for any clinical outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (p > 0.05).

Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to work following TKA in patients of working age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-operatively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   work status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   and Oxford Knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to work or to retire was not assessed pre-operatively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-operatively, the return to work status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, UCLA activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   and Work, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> were   obtained. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 261 patients (90%) who were working before TKA, 105 (40%)   returned to any job, including 89 (34%) who returned to the same   job at a mean of 13.5 weeks (2 to 104) post-operatively. A total   of 108 (41%) retired following TKA and 18 remained on welfare. Patients   not working before the operation did not return to work. Median   UCLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s improved in 125 patients (58%) from 4 (mild activity)   to 6 (moderate activity) (p < 0.001). Significant    (p < 0.05) factors which were predictive of return to any work   included age, heavy or moderate manual work, better post-operative   UCLA, OKS and EQ-5D general health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s. Significant predictive   factors of return to the same work included age, heavy or moderate   manual work and post-operative OKS. Multivariate analysis confirmed   heavy or moderate manual work and age to independently predict a   return to either any or the same work. All patients aged < 50   years who were working pre-operatively returned to any work as did   60% of those aged between 50 and 54 years, 50% of those aged between   55 and 59 years and 24% those aged between 60 and 65 years. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>If working pre-operatively, patients aged < 50 years invariably   returned to work following TKA, but only half of those aged between   50 to 60 years returned.

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the mean SST <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were   significantly better in the mini-open group (91% of mini-open repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; mean SST <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-open group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were also higher in the mini-open   group (mean ASES <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-open group;   mean 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-open repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients. The functional difference   did not translate into a difference in satisfaction.</p><p>Mini-open rotator cuff repair remains a useful technique despite   advances in arthroscopy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:245–9.</p></sec>

Conversion of a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to a total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a potential treatment   for isolated bone on bone osteoarthritis when limited to a single   compartment. The risk for revision of UKA is three times higher   than for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this review was   to discuss the different revision options after UKA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A search was performed for English language articles published   between 2006 and 2016. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 105   papers were selected for further analysis. Of these, 39 papers were   deemed to contain clinically relevant data to be included in this review.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most common reasons for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e are liner dislocation, aseptic   loosening, disease progression of another compartment and unexplained   pain. </p><p>UKA can be revised to or with another UKA if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e mode   allows reconstruction of the joint with UKA components. In case   of disease progression another UKA can be added, either at the patellofemoral   joint or at the remaining tibiofemoral joint. Often the accompanying   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to the knee joint doesn’t allow these two former techniques resulting   in a primary TKA. In a third of cases, revision TKA components are   necessary. This is usually on the tibial side where augments and   stems might be required.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In case of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of UKA, several less invasive revision techniques   remain available to obtain primary results. Revision in a late stage   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e or because of surgical mistakes might ask for the use   of revision components limiting the clinical outcome for the patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):65–9.</p></sec>

Clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of extracorporeal irradiation in limb salvage surgery for bone tumours
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a retrospective review of patients treated with extracorporeally   irradiated allografts for primary and secondary bone tumours with   the mid- and long-term survivorship and the functional and radiographic   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 113 of 116 (97.4%) patients who were treated with   extracorporeally irradiated allografts between 1996 and 2014 were   followed up. Forms of treatment included reconstructions, prostheses   and composite reconstructions, both with and without vascularised   grafts. Survivorship was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.   Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a mean age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a mean age of 26 years (3 to 85). There   were 23 deaths. The five-year patient survivorship was 82.3% and   the ten-year patient survivorship was 79.6%. The mean follow-up   of the 90 surviving patients was 80.3 months (2 to 207). At the   last follow-up, 105 allografts (92.9%) were still in place or had   been at the time of death; eight (7%) had failed due to infection,   local recurrence or fracture. Outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were comparable with   or superior to those in previous studies. The mean outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s   were: MSTS 79% (<sc>sd</sc> 8); TESS 83% (<sc>sd</sc> 19); QLQ 82%   (<sc>sd</sc> 16); ISOLS 80.5% (<sc>sd</sc> 19). </p><p>Pearson correlation analysis showed a strong relationship between   the MSTS and ISOLS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that extracorporeal irradiation is a versatile   reconstructive technique for dealing with large defects after the   resection of bone tumours with good functional and radiographic   outcomes.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a mean of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two fair (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 86.6 (57 to 100).

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> coronary, 161 (4.9%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> coronary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>/total cardiovascular events (10-year risk: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to risk prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and risk factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high risk.</p></sec>

Validating Utility of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Score in a Large Pooled Cohort From 3 Japanese Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Studies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was developed to estimate ischemic and bleeding risks from the DAPT study. However, few studies validated its utility externally. We sought to validate the utility of the DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> in the Japanese population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a pooled cohort of 3 studies conducted in Japan (the CREDO-Kyoto [Coronary Revascularization Demonstrating Outcome Study in Kyoto] Registry Cohort-2, RESET [Randomized Evaluation of Sirolimus-Eluting Versus Everolimus-Eluting Stent Trial], and NEXT [NOBORI Biolimus-Eluting Versus XIENCE/PROMUS Everolimus-Eluting Stent Trial]), we compared risks for ischemic and bleeding events from 13 to 36 months after percutaneous coronary intervention among patients with a DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥2 (high DS) and a DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> <2 (low DS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 12 223 patients receiving drug-eluting stents who were free from ischemic or bleeding events at 13 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, 3944 patients had high DS and 8279 had low DS. The cumulative incidence of primary ischemic end point (myocardial infarction/stent thrombosis) was significantly higher in high DS than in low DS (1.5% versus 0.9%, <i>P</i>=0.002), whereas the cumulative incidence of primary bleeding end point (GUSTO moderate/severe) tended to be lower in high DS than in low DS (2.1% versus 2.7%, <i>P</i>=0.07). The cumulative incidences of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis were also significantly higher in high DS than in low DS (2.0% versus 1.4%, <i>P</i>=0.03; 1.5% versus 0.8%, <i>P</i>=0.002; 0.7% versus 0.3%, <i>P</i><0.001, respectively), whereas the cumulative incidences of noncardiac death and GUSTO severe bleeding were significantly lower in high DS than in low DS (2.4% versus 3.9%, <i>P</i><0.001; 1.0% versus 1.6%, <i>P</i>=0.03, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In the current population, the DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> successfully stratified ischemic and bleeding risks, although the ischemic event rate was remarkably low even in high DS.

The effect of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.</p></sec>

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ estimates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were assessed by using the congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-estimated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in estimating stroke risk; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when estimating bleeding risks. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with high stroke risk, assessed by either empirical model or physician estimates. In contrast, physician and empirical estimates of bleeding had limited impact on treatment choice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>There is little agreement between provider-assessed risk and empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s in AF.

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor
<p>When bacteria encounter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, they respond with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e colonization and virulence induction. The mechanisms of bacterial mechanosensation and downstream signaling remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a tactile sensing cascade in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> in which the flagellar motor acts as sensor. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-induced motor interference stimulated the production of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate by the motor-associated diguanylate cyclase DgcB. This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a polysaccharide adhesin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli. Thus, the bacterial flagellar motor acts as a tetherless sensor reminiscent of mechanosensitive channels.</p>

Optical imaging of surface chemistry and dynamics in confinement
<p>We imaged the interfacial structure and dynamics of water in a microscopically confined geometry, in three dimensions and on millisecond time scales, with a structurally illuminated wide-field second harmonic microscope. The second harmonic images reported on the orientational order of interfacial water, induced by charge-dipole interactions between water molecules and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e charges. The images were converted into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e potential maps. Spatially resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e acid dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a,s</sub>) values were determined for the silica deprotonation reaction by following pH-induced chemical changes on the curved and confined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es of a glass microcapillary immersed in aqueous solutions. These values ranged from 2.3 to 10.7 along the wall of a single capillary because of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e heterogeneities. Water molecules that rotate along an oscillating external electric field were also imaged.</p>

Estimating economic damage from climate change in the United States
<p>Estimates of climate change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>es that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>es between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, replicative stress activates the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. After noise-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e.</p>

The aim of this study   was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic results of   RHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 77 RHAs were implanted in 54 men and 23   women with either acute injuries (54) or with traumatic sequelae   (23) of a fracture of the radial head. Four designs of RHA were   used, including the Guepar (Small Bone Innovations (SBi)/Stryker;   36), Evolutive (Aston Medical; 24), rHead RECON (SBi/Stryker; ten)   or rHead STANDARD (SBi/Stryker; 7) prostheses.

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Both heritable and lifestyle risk factors contribute to elevated BP levels. We aimed to investigate the extent to which lifestyle factors could offset the effect of an adverse BP genetic profile and its effect on CVD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We constructed a genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> for high BP by using 314 published BP loci in 277 005 individuals without previous CVD from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort of individuals aged 40 to 69 years, with a median of 6.11 years of follow-up. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>d participants according to their lifestyle factors including body mass index, healthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, smoking, and urinary sodium excretion levels measured at recruitment. We examined the association between tertiles of genetic risk and tertiles of lifestyle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> with BP levels and incident CVD by using linear regression and Cox regression models, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Healthy lifestyle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was strongly associated with BP (<i>P</i><10<sup>–320</sup>) for systolic and diastolic BP and CVD events regardless of the underlying BP genetic risk. Participants with a favorable in comparison with an unfavorable lifestyle (bottom versus top tertile lifestyle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>) had 3.6, 3.5, and 3.6 mm Hg lower systolic BP in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.0006). Similarly, favorable in comparison with unfavorable lifestyle showed 30%, 31%, and 33% lower risk of CVD among participants in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.99).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data further support population-wide efforts to lower BP in the population via lifestyle modification. The advantages and disadvantages of disclosing genetic predisposition to high BP for risk stratification needs careful evaluation.</p></sec>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e syndrome precipitated by intense emotional stress. Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-term clinical and functional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Taken together our findings demonstrate that after takotsubo cardiomyopathy, patients develop a persistent, long-term heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Cardioprotective Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2 by Suppressing Apoptosis and Necroptosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Programmed cell death, including apoptosis, mitochondria-mediated necrosis, and necroptosis, is critically involved in ischemic cardiac injury, pathological cardiac remodeling, and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e progression. Whereas apoptosis and mitochondria-mediated necrosis signaling is well established, the regulatory mechanisms of necroptosis and its significance in the pathogenesis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e remain elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2) in regulating myocardial necroptosis and remodeling using genetic mouse models. We also performed molecular and cellular biology studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which Traf2 regulates necroptosis signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a critical role for Traf2 in myocardial survival and homeostasis by suppressing necroptosis. Cardiac-specific deletion of <i>Traf2</i> in mice triggered necroptotic cardiac cell death, pathological remodeling, and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Plasma tumor necrosis factor α level was significantly elevated in <i>Traf2</i>-deficient mice, and genetic ablation of <i>TNFR1</i> largely abrogated pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction associated with Traf2 deletion. Mechanistically, Traf2 critically regulates receptor-interacting proteins 1 and 3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein necroptotic signaling with the adaptor protein tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein with death domain as an upstream regulator and transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 as a downstream effector. It is important to note that genetic deletion of <i>RIP3</i> largely rescued the cardiac phenotype triggered by Traf2 deletion, validating a critical role of necroptosis in regulating pathological remodeling and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e propensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results identify an important Traf2-mediated, NFκB-independent, prosurvival pathway in the heart by suppressing necroptotic signaling, which may serve as a new therapeutic target for pathological remodeling and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Prevalence of Subclinical Coronary Artery Disease in Masters Endurance Athletes With a Low Atherosclerotic Risk Profile
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies in middle-age and older (masters) athletes with ath<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>clerotic risk factors for coronary artery disease report higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s compared with sedentary individuals. Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low ath<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>clerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of ath<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>clerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male athletes (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.15; <i>P</i>=0.016); 15 (14%) male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low ath<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>clerotic risk profile have normal CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s. Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men. Coronary plaques are more abundant in athletes, whereas their stable nature could mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for operators. This study aimed to measure DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e/repair markers in operators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e was determined by irradiating operators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in operators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in operators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when operators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response in operators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding. Defining the relationship between this response and cancer risk may better inform safe levels of chronic low-dose radiation exposure.</p></sec>

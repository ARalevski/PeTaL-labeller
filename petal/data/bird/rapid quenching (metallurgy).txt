Coherently aligned nanoparticles within a biogenic single crystal: A biological prestressing strategy
<p>In contrast to synthetic materials, materials produced by organisms are formed in ambient conditions and with a limited selection of elements. Nevertheless, living organisms reveal elegant strategies for achieving specific functions, ranging from skeletal support to mastication, from sensors and defensive tools to optical function. Using state-of-the-art characterization techniques, we present a biostrategy for strengthening and toughening the otherwise brittle calcite optical lenses found in the brittlestar <i>Ophiocoma wendtii</i>. This intriguing process uses coherent nanoprecipitates to induce compressive stresses on the host matrix, functionally resembling the Guinierâ€“Preston zones known in classical metallurgy. We believe that these calcitic nanoparticles, being rich in magnesium, segregate during or just after transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase, similarly to segregation behavior from a supersaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ed alloy.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to dissipate excess absorbed energy as heat via nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting complex family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing close to the core of photosystem II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the antenna. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the antenna complexes or in the core complex. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that core complex-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the antenna complex. Overall, our data clarify the complex molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards electron transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing component of the nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Mitochondrial redox signaling enables repair of injured skeletal muscle cells
<p>Strain and physical trauma to mechanically active cells, such as skeletal muscle myofibers, injures their plasma membranes, and mitochondrial function is required for their repair. We found that mitochondrial function was also needed for plasma membrane repair in myoblasts as well as nonmuscle cells, which depended on mitochondrial uptake of calcium through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Calcium uptake transiently increased the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which locally activated the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, triggering F-actin accumulation at the site of injury and facilitating membrane repair. Blocking mitochondrial calcium uptake or ROS production prevented injury-triggered RhoA activation, actin polymerization, and plasma membrane repair. This repair mechanism was shared between myoblasts, nonmuscle cells, and mature skeletal myofibers. Quenching mitochondrial ROS in myofibers during eccentric exercise ex vivo caused increased damage to myofibers, resulting in a greater loss of muscle force. These results suggest a physiological role for mitochondria in plasma membrane repair in injured cells, a role that highlights a beneficial effect of ROS.</p>

Structural basis for blue-green light harvesting and energy dissipation in diatoms
<p>Diatoms are abundant photosynthetic organisms in aquatic environments and contribute 40% of its primary productivity. An important factor that contributes to the success of diatoms is their fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs), which have exceptional light-harvesting and photoprotection capabilities. Here, we report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal structur</span></strong>e of an FCP from the marine diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>, which reveals the binding of seven chlorophylls (Chls) a, two Chls c, seven fucoxanthins (Fxs), and probably one diadinoxanthin within the protein scaffold. Efficient energy transfer pathways can be found between Chl a and c, and each Fx is surrounded by Chls, enabling the energy transfer and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing via Fx highly efficient. The structure provides a basis for elucidating the mechanisms of blue-green light harvesting, energy transfer, and dissipation in diatoms.</p>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p>Topology and disorder have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a topological indicator after a sudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>, we observed the topological Anderson insulator phase, in which added disorder drives the band structure of a wire from topologically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of topologically nontrivial wires to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting topological fluids.</p>

Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate excited ionic state. The initial condition of the excited state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the excited-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing of the excited state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip heightâ€“dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the excited state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy
<p>Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments conducted with compositionally asymmetric low molar mass poly(isoprene)-<i>b</i>-poly(lactide) diblock copolymers reveal an extraordinary thermal history dependence. The development of distinct periodic crystalline or aperiodic quasicrystalline states depends on how specimens are cooled from the disordered state to temperatures below the order-disorder transition temperature. Whereas direct cooling leads to the formation of documented morphologies, rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ed samples that are then heated from low temperature form the hexagonal C14 and cubic C15 Laves phases commonly found in metal alloys. Self-consistent mean-field theory calculations show that these, and other associated Frank-Kasper phases, have nearly degenerate free energies, suggesting that processing history drives the material into long-lived metastable states defined by self-assembled particles with discrete populations of volumes and polyhedral shapes.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be oxidatively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-oxidative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains oxidized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 oxidation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 oxidation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by âˆ¼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 oxidation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

Light Acclimation of the Colonial Green Alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> Strain Showa
<p>In contrast to single cellular species, detailed information is lacking on the processes of photosynthetic acclimation for colonial algae, although these algae are important for biofuel production, ecosystem biodiversity, and wastewater treatment. To investigate differences between single cellular and colonial species, we studied the regulation of photosynthesis and photoprotection during photoacclimation for the colonial green alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> and made a comparison with the properties of the single cellular species <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. We show that <i>B. braunii</i> shares some high-light (HL) photoacclimation strategies with <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and other frequently studied green algae: decreased chlorophyll content, increased free carotenoid content, and increased nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing (NPQ). Additionally, <i>B. braunii</i> has unique HL photoacclimation strategies, related to its colonial form: strong internal shading by an increase of the colony size and the accumulation of extracellular echinenone (a ketocarotenoid). HL colonies are larger and more spatially heterogenous than low-light colonies. Compared with surface cells, cells deeper inside the colony have increased pigmentation and larger photosystem II antenna size. The core of the largest of the HL colonies does not contain living cells. In contrast with <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, but similar to other biofilm-forming algae, NPQ capacity is substantial in low light. In HL, NPQ amplitude increases, but kinetics are unchanged. We discuss possible causes of the different acclimation responses of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and <i>B. braunii</i>. Knowledge of the specific photoacclimation processes for this colonial green alga further extends the view of the diversity of photoacclimation strategies in photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Plasma Membrane-Type Aquaporins from Marine Diatoms Function as CO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub> Channels and Provide Photoprotection
<p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are ubiquitous water channels that facilitate the transport of many small molecules and may play multiple vital roles in aquatic environments. In particular, mechanisms to maintain transmembrane fluxes of important small molecules have yet to be studied in marine photoautotrophic organisms. Here, we report the occurrence of multiple AQPs with differential cellular localizations in marine diatoms, an important group of oceanic primary producers. The AQPs play a role in mediating the permeability of membranes to CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>. In silico surveys revealed the presence of five AQP orthologs in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> and two in the centric diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i>. GFP fusions of putative AQPs displayed clear localization to the plasma membrane (PtAGP1 and PtAQP2), the chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (CER; PtAGP1 and PtAQP3), and the tonoplast (PtAQP5) in <i>P. tricornutum</i>. In <i>T. pseudonana</i>, GFP-AQP fusion proteins were found on the vacuole membrane (TpAQP1) and CER (TpAQP2). Transcript levels of both <i>PtAQP1</i> and <i>PtAQP2</i> were highly induced by ammonia, while only <i>PtAQP2</i> was induced by high (1%[v/v]) CO<sub>2</sub>. Constitutive overexpression of GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 significantly increased CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in <i>P. tricornutum</i>, strongly indicating that these AQPs function in regulating CO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in the plasma membrane and/or CER. Cells carrying GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 had higher nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing under high light relative to that of wild-type cells, suggesting that these AQPs are involved in photoprotection. These AQPs may facilitate the efflux of NH<sub>3</sub>, preventing the uncoupling effect of high intracellular ammonia concentrations.</p>

Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism
<p>Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis <i>ADT</i> mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in <i>ADT</i> mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in <i>ADT</i> mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and <i>adt3/4/5/6</i>, our most extreme <i>ADT</i> knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> illumination induced nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and attenuated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the attenuation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>er of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>er. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

The role of the different carotenoids bound to LHCII in regulating the structure and function of the complex is a long-lasting question in photosynthesis research. 9-cis-Neoxanthin (Nx) is one of the important carotenoids, which can only be found in the LHCIIs. High-resolution structural analysis of LHCII shows that Nx is located between different monomeric LHCIIs, with one side protruding into the lipid membrane. In this study, the various functional significances of this unique feature of Nx binding in LHCII are studied with the in vitro reconstituted LHCIIs both with and without Nx and the native complexes isolated either from wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) or from its mutant <i>aba4-3</i> lacking Nx. Our results reveal that the binding of Nx affects the binding affinity of violaxanthin (Vx) to LHCII significantly. In the absence of Nx, Vx has a much higher binding affinity to trimeric LHCII. The strong coordination between Nx and Vx at the interfaces of adjacent monomers of LHCII plays an important role both in operating the xanthophyll cycle and in the transient modulation of nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Î”<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Î”<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Î”<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Î”<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Î”0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgÎ”0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Î”0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgÎ”0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>ing control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Î”0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Î”0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

Ischemic Cerebroprotection Conferred by Myeloid Lineage-Restricted or Global CD39 Transgene Expression
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral tissue damage after an ischemic event can be exacerbated by inflammation and thrombosis. Elevated extracellular ATP and ADP levels are associated with cellular injury, inflammation, and thrombosis. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39), an enzyme expressed on the plasmalemma of leukocytes and endothelial cells, suppresses platelet activation and leukocyte infiltration by phosphohydrolyzing ATP/ADP. To investigate the effects of increased CD39 in an in vivo cerebral ischemia model, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing human CD39 (hCD39).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A floxed-stop sequence was inserted between the promoter and the hCD39 transcriptional start site, generating a mouse in which the expression of hCD39 can be controlled tissue-specifically using Cre recombinase mice. We generated mice that express hCD39 globally or in myeloid-lineage cells only. Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volumes were quantified by MRI after 48 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both global and transgenic hCD39- and myeloid lineage CD39-overexpressing mice (transgenic, n=9; myeloid lineage, n=6) demonstrated significantly smaller cerebral infarct volumes compared with wild-type mice. Leukocytes from ischemic and contralateral hemispheres were analyzed by flow cytometry. Although contralateral hemispheres had equal numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, ischemic hemispheres from transgenic mice had less infiltration (n=4). Transgenic mice showed less neurological deficit compared with wild-type mice (n=6).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first report of transgenic overexpression of CD39 in mice imparting a protective phenotype after stroke, with reduced leukocyte infiltration, smaller infarct volumes, and decreased neurological deficit. CD39 overexpression, either globally or in myeloid lineage cells, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quench</span></strong>es postischemic leukosequestration and reduces stroke-induced neurological injury.</p></sec>

Drug Screening Using a Library of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiomyocytes Reveals Disease-Specific Patterns of Cardiotoxicity
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> attrition during pharmaceutical development and has resulted in numerous preventable patient deaths. Incidents of adverse cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> reactions are more common in patients with preexisting heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e than the general population. Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary cardiac disorders to model differences in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Action potential duration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced arrhythmia were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs derived from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary long QT syndrome, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e phenotypes were verified in long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy hiPSC-CMs by immunostaining and single cell patch clamp. Human embryonic stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and the human <i>ether-a-go-go</i>–related gene expressing human embryonic kidney cells were used as controls. Single cell PCR confirmed expression of all cardiac ion channels in patient-specific hiPSC-CMs as well as hESC-CMs, but not in human embryonic kidney cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific hiPSC-CMs demonstrated increased susceptibility to known cardiotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s as measured by action potential duration and quantification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced arrhythmias such as early afterdepolarizations and delayed afterdepolarizations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We have recapitulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced cardiotoxicity profiles for healthy subjects, long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy patients at the single cell level for the first time. Our data indicate that healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed individuals exhibit different susceptibilities to cardiotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s and that use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific hiPSC-CMs may predict adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> responses more accurately than the standard human <i>ether-a-go-go</i>–related gene test or healthy control hiPSC-CM/hESC-CM screening assays.</p></sec>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s with 15 time-matched QT and plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The genetic QT score was correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% confidence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT score was a significant predictor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=12%, <i>P</i>=1×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate that a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced torsade de pointes.

Germinal center antibody mutation trajectories are determined by rapid self/foreign discrimination
<p>Antibodies have the specificity to differentiate foreign <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s that mimic self <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s, but it remains unclear how such specificity is acquired. In a mouse model, we generated B cells displaying an antibody that cross-reacts with two related protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s expressed on self versus foreign cells. B cell anergy was imposed by self <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> but reversed upon challenge with high-density foreign <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>, leading to germinal center recruitment and antibody gene hypermutation. Single-cell analysis detected rapid selection for mutations that decrease self affinity and slower selection for epistatic mutations that specifically increase foreign affinity. Crystal structures revealed that these mutations exploited subtle topological differences to achieve 5000-fold preferential binding to foreign over self epitopes. Resolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>ic mimicry drove the optimal affinity maturation trajectory, highlighting the value of retaining self-reactive clones as substrates for protective antibody responses.</p>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e risk extended beyond its effect on blood pressure. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, peripheral arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and stroke.

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

Antihomotypic affinity maturation improves human B cell responses against a repetitive epitope
<p>Affinity maturation selects B cells expressing somatically mutated antibody variants with improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>-binding properties to protect from invading pathogens. We determined the molecular mechanism underlying the clonal selection and affinity maturation of human B cells expressing protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es against the circumsporozoite protein of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (PfCSP). We show in molecular detail that the repetitive nature of PfCSP facilitates direct homotypic interactions between two PfCSP repeat-bound monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, thereby improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> affinity and B cell activation. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the strong selection of somatic mutations that mediate homotypic antibody interactions after repeated parasite exposure in humans. Our findings demonstrate a different mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>-mediated affinity maturation to improve antibody responses to PfCSP and presumably other repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s.</p>

Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans
<p>For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at high antibody titers. Thus, immune correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.</p>

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, and ancillary antiarrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24).

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed.

A Nanoparticle-Based Combination Chemotherapy Delivery System for Enhanced Tumor Killing by Dynamic Rewiring of Signaling Pathways
<sec><title>Timing the One-Two Punch</title><p>Morton <i>et al</i>. developed a dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, time-delayed nanoparticle delivery system for treating cancer. The nanoparticles contained two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s (one in the membrane and one in the center) and were coated to target the nanoparticles to cancer cells. Cancer cells took up the nanoparticles. The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> quickly escaped the nanoparticle, sensitizing the cells to the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, which escaped more slowly. In mice, tumors from cells that respond to the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> were reduced when the mice were treated with the dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> nanoparticles, but the tumors continued to grow in mice receiving only single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> therapy. This time-delayed, nanoparticle-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> delivery may avoid the resistance that cancer cells develop to chemotherapy.</p></sec>

Separating host and microbiome contributions to drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity
<p>The gut microbiota is implicated in the metabolism of many medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, with consequences for interpersonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> efficacy and toxicity. However, quantifying microbial contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism is challenging, particularly in cases where host and microbiome perform the same metabolic transformation. We combined gut commensal genetics with gnotobiotics to measure brivudine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism across tissues in mice that vary in a single microbiome-encoded enzyme. Informed by these measurements, we built a pharmacokinetic model that quantitatively predicts microbiome contributions to systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> and metabolite exposure, as a function of bioavailability, host and microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-metabolizing activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> and metabolite absorption, and intestinal transit kinetics. Clonazepam studies illustrate how this approach disentangles microbiome contributions to metabolism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s subject to multiple metabolic routes and transformations.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance has contributed to the continuing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. A global effort to develop new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

Redemption for self-reactive antibodies
<p>Immunity to pathogens and tolerance to self are cardinal features of immune systems. Immunological specificity is encoded by receptors expressed on the surface of lymphocytes that are generated through random assembly of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) gene segments during B and T lymphocyte development. In addition, B lymphocytes further diversify this initial repertoire through somatic hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers (transient structures that form in lymphoid organs in which high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es arise). On page 223 of this issue, Burnett <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) devise a strategy to track the fate of self-reactive B cells in germinal centers elicited by a foreign <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> that structurally mimics a self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> mimicry). The authors provide evidence that hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers can repair self-reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. These results have implications for how broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to HIV-1 may be formed.</p>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both models without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with new techniques and devices. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel devices such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stents and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive devices to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Understanding Lassa fever
<p>Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in West Africa that has been gaining international attention as an emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with the potential to cause epidemics (<i>1</i>). Confirmed and suspected cases of Lassa fever have been steadily rising in Nigeria over the past 3 years. Laboratory-confirmed cases have increased from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and had already reached 562 by November 2018 (<i>2</i>). Part of defining the scope of the problem is trying to assess whether this is a true increase in the number of people afflicted by the infection, due to either changes in the virus itself or the geographical spread of the vector (rodents of the <i>Mastomys</i> spp.), or a reflection of higher rates of detection and diagnosis secondary to the increased attention and interest of clinicians and laboratorians (<i>1</i>). Lassa fever outbreaks illustrate the issues associated with the response and management of emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es: How do you plan the public health, clinical, and community responses to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e while you are still learning about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidemiolog</span></strong>y, pathophysiology, and the ecological factors contributing to the spread of the pathogen? On page 74 of this issue, Kafetzopoulou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present the results of a rapid genomic study of Lassa virus (LASV) from the cases of 2018, which have improved understanding of how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has been spreading in Nigeria and have led to informed and targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-control strategies.

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of food allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or contaminating other foods can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, identified the peanut allergen–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Perivascular dendritic cells elicit anaphylaxis by relaying allergens to mast cells via microvesicles
<p>Anaphylactic reactions are triggered when allergens enter the blood circulation and activate immunoglobulin E (IgE)–sensitized mast cells (MCs), causing systemic discharge of prestored proinflammatory mediators. As MCs are extravascular, how they perceive circulating allergens remains a conundrum. Here, we describe the existence of a CD301b<sup>+</sup> perivascular dendritic cell (DC) subset that continuously samples blood and relays <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s to neighboring MCs, which vigorously degranulate and trigger anaphylaxis. DC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> transfer involves the active discharge of surface-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s on 0.5- to 1.0-micrometer microvesicles (MVs) generated by vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> sharing by DCs is not limited to MCs, as neighboring DCs also acquire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>-bearing MVs. This capacity of DCs to distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>-bearing MVs to various immune cells in the perivascular space potentiates inflammatory and immune responses to blood-borne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile virus became far more susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and death from Zika virus, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an immune gene that normally helps suppress Zika virus, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that infect humans. Infection with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e if they subsequently become infected by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavivirus family and the researchers warn that a vaccine against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es led to the most severe Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. ADE also led to high levels of virus in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

Phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein by mutant LRRK2 promotes AICD activity and neurotoxicity in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mutations in <i>LRRK2</i>, which encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are the most common genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (PD), a degenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of the central nervous system that causes impaired motor function and, in advanced stages, dementia. Dementia is a common symptom of another neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, Alzheimer’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and research suggests that there may be pathophysiological and genetic links between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Aggregates of β amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)] are seen in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es and in PD patients carrying G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain tissue, and PD model mice, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and phosphorylated APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> within its intracellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with increased nuclear abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in cultures and brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Overexpression of AICD, but not a phosphodeficient mutant (AICD<sup>T668A</sup>), increased the loss of dopaminergic neurons in older mice expressing LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup>. Moreover, the amount of Thr<sup>668</sup>-phosphorylated APP was substantially greater in postmortem brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons (generated by reprogramming skin cells) from LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> in the patient-derived dopaminergic neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> mice. Thus, APP is a substrate of LRRK2, and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and neurotoxicity in PD.</p>

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers
<p>In vaccine design, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s are often arrayed in a multivalent nanoparticle form, but in vivo mechanisms underlying the enhanced immunity elicited by such vaccines remain poorly understood. We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or “free” forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and immunogen glycan–dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via immunogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses.

Universal protection against influenza infection by a multidomain antibody to influenza hemagglutinin
<p>Broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es against highly variable pathogens have stimulated the design of vaccines and therapeutics. We report the use of diverse camelid single-domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to influenza virus hemagglutinin to generate multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with impressive breadth and potency. Multidomain antibody MD3606 protects mice against influenza A and B infection when administered intravenously or expressed locally from a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector. Crystal and single-particle electron microscopy structures of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with hemagglutinins from influenza A and B viruses reveal binding to highly conserved epitopes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es targeting multiple epitopes exhibit enhanced virus cross-reactivity and potency. In combination with adeno-associated virus–mediated gene delivery, they may provide an effective strategy to prevent infection with influenza virus and other highly variable pathogens.</p>

The target landscape of clinical kinase drugs
<p>Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics. Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, offered a perspective on the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>gable” kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD–positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource, available via the ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate basic, clinical, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> discovery research and aid clinical decision-making.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the brain that are believed to be associated with pathogenesis—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using immunological or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e course. In addition, treating brain inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s has shown limited or no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the immune system, including the resident brain myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.</p>

Landscape of immunogenic tumor antigens in successful immunotherapy of virally induced epithelial cancer
<p>Immunotherapy has clinical activity in certain virally associated cancers. However, the tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s targeted in successful treatments remain poorly defined. We used a personalized immunogenomic approach to elucidate the global landscape of antitumor T cell responses in complete regression of human papillomavirus–associated metastatic cervical cancer after tumor-infiltrating adoptive T cell therapy. Remarkably, immunodominant T cell reactivities were directed against mutated neo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s or a cancer germline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>, rather than canonical viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s. T cells targeting viral tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s did not display preferential in vivo expansion. Both viral and nonviral tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>–specific T cells resided predominantly in the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)–expressing T cell compartment, which suggests that PD-1 blockade may unleash diverse antitumor T cell reactivities. These findings suggest a new paradigm of targeting nonviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>s in immunotherapy of virally associated cancers.</p>

Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection
<p>Novel vaccines are urgently needed to reduce the burden of severe malaria. Using a differential whole-proteome screening method, we identified <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> schizont egress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong>-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kilodalton parasite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> expressed in schizont-infected red blood cells (RBCs). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to PfSEA-1 decreased parasite replication by arresting schizont rupture, and conditional disruption of PfSEA-1 resulted in a profound parasite replication defect. Vaccination of mice with recombinant <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> PbSEA-1 significantly reduced parasitemia and delayed mortality after lethal challenge with the <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> strain ANKA. Tanzanian children with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to recombinant PfSEA-1A (rPfSEA-1A) did not experience severe malaria, and Kenyan adolescents and adults with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to rPfSEA-1A had significantly lower parasite densities than individuals without these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es.

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

A Synthetic Glycan Microarray Enables Epitope Mapping of Plant Cell Wall Glycan-Directed Antibodies
<p>In the last three decades, more than 200 monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have been raised against most classes of plant cell wall polysaccharides by different laboratories worldwide. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es are widely used to identify differences in plant cell wall components in mutants, organ and tissue types, and developmental stages. Despite their importance and broad use, the precise binding epitope has been determined for only a few of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. Here, we use a plant glycan microarray equipped with 88 synthetic oligosaccharides to comprehensively map the epitopes of plant cell wall glycan-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. Our results reveal the binding epitopes for 78 arabinogalactan-, rhamnogalacturonan-, xylan-, and xyloglucan-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. We demonstrate that, with knowledge of the exact epitopes recognized by individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, specific glycosyl hydrolases can be implemented into immunological cell wall analyses, providing a framework to obtain structural information on plant cell wall glycans with unprecedented molecular precision.</p>

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac biology and mechanisms driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA amplification strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury. Clustering analysis based on differential gene expression unveiled known and novel markers of all main cardiac cell types. Based on differential gene expression, we could identify multiple subpopulations within a certain cell type. Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor β triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac cells, as well as cell type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited.

Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Phenotype risk scores identify patients with unrecognized Mendelian disease patterns
<p>Genetic association studies often examine features independently, potentially missing subpopulations with multiple phenotypes that share a single cause. We describe an approach that aggregates phenotypes on the basis of patterns described by Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. We mapped the clinical features of 1204 Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es into phenotypes captured from the electronic health record (EHR) and summarized this evidence as phenotype risk scores (PheRSs). In an initial validation, PheRS distinguished cases and controls of five Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Applying PheRS to 21,701 genotyped individuals uncovered 18 associations between rare variants and phenotypes consistent with Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. In 16 patients, the rare genetic variants were associated with severe outcomes such as organ transplants. PheRS can augment rare-variant interpretation and may identify subsets of patients with distinct genetic causes for common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p>

Mapping the malaria parasite druggable genome by using in vitro evolution and chemogenomics
<p>Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> targets and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-resistance genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites resistant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene amplifications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-resistance acquisition, where gene amplifications contributed to one-third of resistance acquisition events. Beyond confirming previously identified multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-resistance mechanisms, we discovered hitherto unrecognized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> target–inhibitor pairs, including thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea. This exploration of the <i>P. falciparum</i> resistome and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>gable genome will likely guide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> discovery and structural biology efforts, while also advancing our understanding of resistance mechanisms available to the malaria parasite.</p>

Life, death, and antibodies
<p>The production of high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es has fascinated immunologists for many decades. A potent arm of the immune response, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es are forged in transient tissue structures called germinal centers (GCs) that appear in lymph nodes a few days after an infection is initiated. Over the ensuing days and weeks, the GC witnesses a cellular pantomime that includes rapid bursts of B lymphocyte proliferation and multicellular migratory cycles that have a unique purpose. These B cells are in the act of mutating, reshaping, testing, and improving their antibody specificities. While their antibody is refined, GC B cells are also undergoing further differentiation to be retasked for new, long-term occupations as circulating memory cells in the blood or bone marrow-resident, long-lived plasma cells that will produce high-affinity, protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es for life. These intense proliferation and selection processes are balanced by an extraordinary rate of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and there is much speculation as to how and why so many B cells are targeted for apoptosis. On page 193 of this issue, Mayer <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) identify the paths leading to B cell apoptosis in the GC reaction.</p>

Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus
<p>The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antigen</span></strong> expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for vaccine design against these threats to global health.</p>

Redox-based reagents for chemoselective methionine bioconjugation
<p>Cysteine can be specifically functionalized by a myriad of acid-base conjugation strategies for applications ranging from probing protein function to antibody-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> conjugates and proteomics. In contrast, selective ligation to the other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, has been precluded by its intrinsically weaker nucleophilicity. Here, we report a strategy for chemoselective methionine bioconjugation through redox reactivity, using oxaziridine-based reagents to achieve highly selective, rapid, and robust methionine labeling under a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biocompat</span></strong>ible reaction conditions. We highlight the broad utility of this conjugation method to enable precise addition of payloads to proteins, synthesis of antibody-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> conjugates, and identification of hyperreactive methionine residues in whole proteomes.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inocul</span></strong>ated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty is not associated with cardiac disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Many case reports and small studies have suggested that cobalt   ions are a potential cause of cardiac complications, specifically   cardiomyopathy, after metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty   (THA). The impact of metal ions on the incidence of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e   after MoM THA has not been evaluated in large studies. The aim of   this study was to compare the rate of onset of new cardiac symptoms   in patients who have undergone MoM THA with those who have undergone   metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from the Standard Analytics Files database   for patients who underwent MoM THA between 2005 and 2012. Bearing   surface was selected using International Classification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es   ninth revision codes. Patients with a minimum five-year follow-up   were selected. An age and gender-matched cohort of patients who underwent   MoP THA served as a comparison group. New diagnoses of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e   were collected during the follow-up period. Comorbidities and demographics   were identified and routine descriptive statistics were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 29 483 patients who underwent MoM THA and 24 175   matched patients who underwent MoP THA. Both groups had a mean Charlson   comorbidity index score of 4. There were no statistically significant   differences in 30 of 31 pre-existing comorbidities. Patients undergoing   MoM THA had a slightly lower incidence of cardiac failure compared   with those undergoing MoP THA at three years (6.60% <i>versus</i> 7.06%,   odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.99)   and four years (8.73% <i>versus</i> 9.49%, OR 0.91, 95%   CI 0.86 to 0.97) postoperatively, with no difference in the incidence   of new cardiac failure in between the groups at five years. There   was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy at any time   between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MoM THA is not associated with cardiac complications. Initial   reports may have represented individual instances of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e   in patients with a failing MoM articulation rather than an emerging   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidemiolog</span></strong>ical trend.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:28–32.</p></sec>

Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is 1 of the major causes of maternal mortality. We studied pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatic mitral valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Registry of Pregnancy and Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is an international prospective registry, and consecutive pregnant women with cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e were included. Pregnancy outcomes in all women with rheumatic mitral valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and no prepregnancy valve replacement is described in the present study (n=390). A maternal cardiac event was defined as cardiac death, arrhythmia requiring treatment, heart failure, thromboembolic event, aortic dissection, endocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for other cardiac reasons or cardiac intervention. Associations between patient characteristics and cardiac outcomes were checked in a 3-level model (patient–center–country).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most patients came from emerging countries (75%). Mitral stenosis (MS) with or without mitral regurgitation (MR) was present in 273 women, isolated MR in 117. The degree of MS was mild in 20.9%, moderate in 39.2%, severe in 19.8%, and severity not classified in the remainder. Maternal death during pregnancy occurred in 1 patient with severe MS. Hospital admission occurred in 23.1% of the women with MS, and the main reason was heart failure (mild MS 15.8%, moderate 23.4%, severe 48.1%; <i>P</i><0.001). Heart failure occurred in 23.1% of patients with moderate or severe MR. An intervention during pregnancy was performed in 16 patients, 14 had percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy, and 2 had surgical valve replacement (1 for MS, 1 for MR). In multivariable modeling, prepregnancy New York Heart Association class >1 was an independent predictor of maternal cardiac events. Follow-up at 6 months postpartum was available for 53%, and 3 more patients died (1 with severe MS, 1 with moderate MS, 1 with moderate to severe MR).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although mortality was only 1.9% during pregnancy, ≈50% of the patients with severe rheumatic MS and 23% of those with significant MR developed heart failure during pregnancy. Prepregnancy counseling and considering mitral valve interventions in selected patients are important to prevent these complications.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its target genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Furthermore, normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract.

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> steers numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> nor an anti-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis. Single cell-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation, induced by the inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis.</p>

Deetiolation Enhances Phototropism by Modulating NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL3 Phosphorylation Status
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in (phot) receptor kinases play important roles in promoting plant growth by controlling light-capturing processes, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is mediated through the action of NON-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>IC HYPOCOTYL3 (NPH3), which is dephosphorylated following phot activation. However, the functional significance of this early signaling event remains unclear. Here, we show that the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in dark-grown (etiolated) seedlings of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is enhanced by greening (deetiolation). Red and blue light were equally effective in promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in Arabidopsis, consistent with our observations that deetiolation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e or cryptochrome was sufficient to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Increased responsiveness did not result from an enhanced sensitivity to the phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, nor does it involve the phot-interacting protein, ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ISM2. Instead, deetiolated seedlings showed attenuated levels of NPH3 dephosphorylation and diminished relocalization of NPH3 from the plasma membrane during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Likewise, etiolated seedlings that lack the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>E-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 displayed reduced NPH3 dephosphorylation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism, consistent with their constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in darkness. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ic enhancement could also be achieved in etiolated seedlings by lowering the light intensity to diminish NPH3 dephosphorylation. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is enhanced following deetiolation through the modulation of a phosphorylation rheostat, which in turn sustains the activity of NPH3. We propose that this dynamic mode of regulation enables young seedlings to maximize their establishment under changing light conditions, depending on their photoautotrophic capacity.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that C<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>age stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> sensitivity and decreased the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling components.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitor 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> perception inhibitor <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These inhibitors had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. Inhibitory effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are products of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-degraded products from older to younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es compared with wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es indicated a need for nitrate assimilation products. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-degraded N from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein degradation in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene interplay during root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic root growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene cross talk necessary for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ism.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carriers regulate directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> movement by establishing local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> has been proposed to modulate its own transport by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> affects PIN trafficking by screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>ole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced growth.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> regulates many aspects of growth and development in land plants, but the origin and evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-related pathways diverged before the emergence of land plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of land plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-signaling pathway found in land plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis and of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in land plants.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors definitively established that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors affect all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport inhibitor response1</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>s, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

<p>A fundamental challenge in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation stream. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical traits.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral roots. To test the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx in nodulation we used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of developing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ism, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots developed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> during nodule formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced <i>SMALL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated elongation. The time courses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. We thus propose that polarly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s are profoundly different, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and in intact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p>Water deficit tolerance during post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of water deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon rainforest. The root : shoot ratio increased under water deficit. The leaf number and water potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of seedlings under severe stress. Water deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. Water deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to water deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when water availability is greatly limited.</p>

LEAFY Controls Auxin Response Pathways in Floral Primordium Formation
<sec><title>Signals to Blossom</title><p>In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) stimulates flower development, and the formation of floral and leaf primordial tissue is stimulated by the hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>.

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, facilitated by the combined activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport whereby it imapcts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation.</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms (including plant pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with plants) promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, growth, and the accumulation of high levels of starch in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants not exposed to VCs, plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and growth, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of plastidic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of plants to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis plants cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and the accumulation of plastidic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es accumulated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, starch metabolism, and growth that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> plants. The overall data show that Arabidopsis plants can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic microorganisms by triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>s to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

Red Light-Induced Phosphorylation of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in Stomatal Guard Cells
<p>Stomatal opening is stimulated by red and blue light. Blue light activates plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by phosphorylating its penultimate residue, threonine, via a blue light photoreceptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in-mediated signaling pathway in guard cells. Blue light-activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase promotes the accumulation of osmolytes and, thus, the osmotic influx of water into guard cells, driving stomatal opening. Red light-induced stomatal opening is thought to be dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in both guard cell chloroplasts and mesophyll cells; however, how red light induces stomatal opening and whether PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is involved in this process have remained unclear. In this study, we established an immunohistochemical technique to detect the phosphorylation level of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells using whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and unexpectedly found that red light induces PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es was correlated with stomatal opening under red light and was inhibited by the plant hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abscisic acid</span></strong>. In <i>aha1</i>-<i>9</i>, a knockout mutant of one of the major isoforms of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells, red light-dependent stomatal opening was delayed in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Furthermore, the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibited red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation as well as red light-induced stomatal opening in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our results indicate that red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in guard cells promotes stomatal opening in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, providing insight into the photosynthetic regulation of stomatal opening.</p>

The ARF7 and ARF19 Transcription Factors Positively Regulate <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> in Arabidopsis Roots
<p>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a key regulatory component of the response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. However, the regulation of <i>PHR1</i> in this response remains poorly understood. Here, we report that <i>PHR1</i> is a target of the transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and is positively regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots. <i>PHR1</i> expression was induced by exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and suppressed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitors in Arabidopsis roots. In the <i>PHR1</i> promoter, three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-response elements, which are bound directly by ARF7 and ARF19, were shown to be essential for <i>PHR1</i> expression. The <i>arf7</i>, <i>arf19</i>, and <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutants showed down-regulated expression of <i>PHR1</i> and downstream Pi starvation-induced genes in roots; they also exhibited defective Pi uptake in roots and overaccumulation of anthocyanin in shoots. The induction of lateral root formation in response to low Pi and to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> was decreased in the <i>phr1</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16</i> (<i>LBD16</i>) and <i>LBD29</i> was not changed significantly. PHR1 acted independently of LBD16 and LBD29 in the regulation of lateral root formation in response to low Pi. Under low-Pi conditions, lateral root impairment in the <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutant was partially rescued by constitutive expression of <i>PHR1</i>, demonstrating that reduced <i>PHR1</i> expression contributed to the <i>arf7 arf19</i> phenotype. In addition to <i>PHR1</i>, other genes encoding MYB-CC members also were targets of ARF7 and ARF19. Our work thus reveals a mechanism coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and the PHR1 regulon in Arabidopsis responses to Pi deficiency.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter mutants (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport driven by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

SELF-PRUNING Acts Synergistically with DIAGEOTROPICA to Guide Auxin Responses and Proper Growth Form
<p>The <i>SELF PRUNING</i> (<i>SP</i>) gene is a key regulator of growth habit in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). It is an ortholog of <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i>, a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein with antiflorigenic activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A spontaneous loss-of-function mutation (<i>sp</i>) has been bred into several industrial tomato cultivars, as it produces a suite of pleiotropic effects that are favorable for mechanical harvesting, including determinate growth habit, short plant stature, and simultaneous fruit ripening. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical basis for these phenotypic differences has not been thoroughly explained. Here, we show that the <i>sp</i> mutation alters polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic curvature and elongation of excised hypocotyl segments. We also demonstrate that free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-regulated gene expression patterns are altered in <i>sp</i> mutants. Furthermore, <i>diageotropica</i>, a mutation in a gene encoding a cyclophilin A protein, appears to confer epistatic effects with <i>sp</i>. Our results indicate that SP affects the tomato growth habit at least in part by influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and responsiveness. These findings suggest potential novel targets that could be manipulated for controlling plant growth habit and improving productivity.</p>

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses
<p>The phytohormones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abscisic acid</span></strong> (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) response pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant development and environmental adaptation. Here, we show that <i>ABI1</i>, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling, is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-modulated root development. We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary root growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking. And <i>sHSP22 OX</i> lines initiated more lateral roots after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> application. Our results suggest that sHSP22 regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response through modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport, and ABI1-sHSP22 provides a novel module orchestrating ABA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling crosstalk in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses six <i>LAZY</i> genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in roots and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to root and shoot branch angles and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary roots. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ism mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral root branch angle. Lateral roots of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary root axis, and they were a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic, but their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the root of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic response. A reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient across the root visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a plant’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host plant, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of AM plants differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abscisic acid</span></strong> (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es from three species, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in sun-grown but not shade-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, primarily because thin shade-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α homologs encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β homolog. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> conjugate sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the abundance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced abundance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carriers, possibly due to impaired PIN recycling and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

Leaf Endoplasmic Reticulum Bodies Identified in Arabidopsis Rosette Leaves Are Involved in Defense against Herbivory
<p>ER bodies are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles specific to the order Brassicales and are thought to function in plant defense against insects and pathogens. ER bodies are generally classified into two types: constitutive ER bodies in the epidermal cells of seedlings, and wound-inducible ER bodies in rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Herein, we reveal a third type of ER body found in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and designate them “leaf ERbodies” (L-ER bodies). L-ER bodies constitutively occurred in specific cells of the rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es: marginal cells, epidermal cells covering the midrib, and giant pavement cells. The distribution of L-ER bodies was closely associated with the expression profile of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NAI1, which is responsible for constitutive ER-body formation. L-ER bodies were seldom observed in <i>nai1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, indicating that NAI1 is involved in L-ER body formation. Confocal imaging analysis revealed that L-ER bodies accumulated two types of β-glucosidases: PYK10, the constitutive ER-body β-glucosidase; and BETA-GLUCOSIDASE18 (BGLU18), the wound-inducible ER-body β-glucosidase. Combined with the absence of L-ER bodies in the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant, these results indicate that BGLU18 and PYK10 are the major components of L-ER bodies. A subsequent feeding assay with the terrestrial isopod <i>Armadillidium vulgare</i> revealed that <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es were severely damaged as a result of herbivory. In addition, the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant was defective in the hydrolysis of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate These results suggest that L-ER bodies are involved in the production of defensive compound(s) from 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate that protect Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es against herbivory attack.</p>

Three Auxin Response Factors Promote Hypocotyl Elongation

By studying Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs), we have identified three ARF proteins that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive hypocotyl elongation. Plants deficient in these factors have reduced responses to environmental conditions that increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels, including far-red-enriched light and high temperature. Despite having decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, the ARF-deficient plants responded to brassinosteroid and gibberellin, indicating that different hormones can act partially independently. Aux/IAA proteins, encoded by <i>IAA</i> genes, interact with ARF proteins to repress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response. Silencing expression of multiple <i>IAA</i> genes increased hypocotyl elongation, suggesting that Aux/IAA proteins modulate ARF activity in hypocotyls in a potential negative feedback loop.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress

We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks.

Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant root</span></strong> system strongly depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of salt.

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf acts as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-regulated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-regulated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes, suggesting that various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical/developmental processes might be controlled by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial regulation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was irradiated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was irradiated with far-red light. Most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local irradiation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain position in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be irradiated. This result was consistent with a previous report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> synthesis genes are up-regulated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> acts as an important intraorgan signaling factor that controls the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Spatial Control of Gene Expression by miR319-Regulated TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>The characteristic leaf shapes we see in all plants are in good part the outcome of the combined action of several transcription factor networks that translate into cell division activity during the early development of the organ. We show here that wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es have distinct transcriptomic profiles in center and marginal regions. Certain transcripts are enriched in margins, including those of <i>CINCINNATA</i>-like <i>TCPs</i> (<i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED, CYCLOIDEA</i> and <i>PCF1/2</i>) and members of the <i>NGATHA</i> and <i>STYLISH</i> gene families. We study in detail the contribution of microRNA319 (miR319)-regulated TCP transcription factors to the development of the center and marginal regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. We compare in molecular analyses the wild type, the <i>tcp2 tcp4</i> mutant that has enlarged flat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, and the <i>tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10</i> mutant with strongly crinkled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. The different leaf domains of the <i>tcp</i> mutants show changed expression patterns for many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-related genes, indicating delayed differentiation, especially in the marginal parts of the organ. At the same time, we found an up-regulation of cyclin genes and other genes that are known to participate in cell division, specifically in the marginal regions of <i>tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10</i>. Using GUS reporter constructs, we confirmed extended mitotic activity in the <i>tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10</i> leaf, which persisted in small defined foci in the margins when the mitotic activity had already ceased in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our results describe the role of miR319-regulated TCP transcription factors in the coordination of activities in different leaf domains during organ development.</p>

Ethylene Receptors Signal via a Noncanonical Pathway to Regulate Abscisic Acid Responses
<p>Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone perceived by a family of receptors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) including ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) and ETR2. Previously we showed that <i>etr1</i>-<i>6</i> loss-of-function plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ate better and <i>etr2</i>-<i>3</i> loss-of-function plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ate worse than wild-type under NaCl stress and in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abscisic acid</span></strong> (ABA). In this study, we expanded these results by showing that ETR1 and ETR2 have contrasting roles in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation under a variety of inhibitory conditions for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation such as treatment with KCl, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, and ethanol. Pharmacological and molecular biology results support a model where ETR1 and ETR2 are indirectly affecting the expression of genes encoding ABA signaling proteins to affect ABA sensitivity. The receiver domain of ETR1 is involved in this function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation under these conditions and controlling the expression of genes encoding ABA signaling proteins. Epistasis analysis demonstrated that these contrasting roles of ETR1 and ETR2 do not require the canonical ethylene signaling pathway. To explore the importance of receptor-protein interactions, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screens using the cytosolic domains of ETR1 and ETR2 as bait. Unique interacting partners with either ETR1 or ETR2 were identified. We focused on three of these proteins and confirmed the interactions with receptors. Loss of these proteins led to faster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation in response to ABA, showing that they are involved in ABA responses. Thus, ETR1 and ETR2 have both ethylene-dependent and -independent roles in plant cells that affect responses to ABA.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es are less prone to photoinhibition than older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Abscisic Acid Modulates Seed Germination via ABA INSENSITIVE5-Mediated PHOSPHATE1
<p>The phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abscisic acid</span></strong> (ABA) controls many developmental and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical processes. Here, we report that PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) participates in ABA-mediated seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and early seedling development. The transcription of <i>PHO1</i> was obviously enhanced during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and early seedling development and repressed by exogenous ABA. The <i>pho1</i> mutants (<i>pho1-2</i>, <i>pho1-4</i>, and <i>pho1-5</i>) showed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes, whereas the <i>PHO1</i>-overexpressing lines were ABA-insensitive during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and early seedling development. The expression of <i>PHO1</i> was repressed in the <i>ABI5</i>-overexpressing line and elevated in the <i>abi5</i> mutant, and ABI5 can bind to the <i>PHO1</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, indicating that ABI5 directly down-regulated <i>PHO1</i> expression. Disruption of <i>PHO1</i> abolished the ABA-insensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation phenotypes of <i>abi5</i> mutant, demonstrating that <i>PHO1</i> was epistatic to <i>ABI5</i>. Together, these data demonstrate that PHO1 is involved in ABA-mediated seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and early seedling development and transcriptionally regulated by ABI5.</p>

Type B Response Regulators Act As Central Integrators in Transcriptional Control of the Auxin Biosynthesis Enzyme TAA1
<p>During embryogenesis and organ formation, establishing proper gradient is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function, which is achieved through coordinated regulation of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> metabolism and transport. Expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic genes is often tissue specific and is regulated by environmental signals. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic gene, <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1 (<i>TAA1</i>). A canonical and a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) response regulator (ARR) binding site were identified in the promoter and the second intron of <i>TAA1</i>, which were required for its tissue-specific expression. C-termini of a subset of the type B ARRs selectively bind to one or both cis elements and activate the expression of <i>TAA1</i>. We further demonstrated that the ARRs not only mediate the transcriptional regulation of <i>TAA1</i> by cytokinins, but also mediate its regulation by ethylene, light, and developmental signals. Through direct protein-protein interactions, the transcriptional activity of ARR1 is enhanced by ARR12, DELLAs, and ethylene-insenstive3 (EIN3). Our study thus revealed the ARR proteins act as key node that mediate the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis by various hormonal, environmental, and developmental signals through transcriptional regulation of the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis gene <i>TAA1</i>.</p>

Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the root tip.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>age by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>age by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

A DII Domain-Based Auxin Reporter Uncovers Low Auxin Signaling during Telophase and Early G1
<p>A sensitive and dynamically responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling reporter based on the DII domain of the INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID28 (IAA28, DII) protein from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was modified for use in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The DII domain was fused to a yellow fluorescent protein and a nuclear localization sequence to simplify quantitative nuclear fluorescence signal. DII degradation dynamics provide an estimate of input signal into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling pathway that is influenced by both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation and F-box coreceptor concentration. In maize, the DII-based marker responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> via proteasome-mediated degradation. Low levels of DII-specific fluorescence corresponding to high endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling occurred near vasculature tissue and the outer layer and glume primordia of spikelet pair meristems and floral meristems, respectively. In addition, high DII levels were observed in cells during telophase and early G1, suggesting that low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling at these stages may be important for cell cycle progression.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading
<p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) translocate sucrose (Suc) across cellular membranes, and in eudicots, multiple SUTs are known to function in Suc phloem loading in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem loading based upon RNA expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized function in Suc phloem loading or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem unloading, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in multiple cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it functions in phloem companion cells to load Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem unloading, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent function in either unloading process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> function (phloem loading and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es in engineering C<sub>3</sub> grasses for C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is discussed.</p>

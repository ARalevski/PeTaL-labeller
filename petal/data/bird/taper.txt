A comparison study of stem taper material loss at similar and mixed metal head-neck taper junctions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to determine whether cobalt-chromium alloy (CoCr) femoral   stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>s (trunnions) wear more than titanium (Ti) alloy stem   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>s (trunnions) when used in a large diameter (LD) metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip arthroplasty system.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed explant analysis using validated methodology to   determine the volumetric material loss at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> surfaces of   explanted LD CoCr MoM hip arthroplasties used with either a Ti alloy   (n = 28) or CoCr femoral stem (n = 21). Only 12/14 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> constructs   with a rough male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> surface and a nominal included angle close   to 5.666° were included. Multiple regression modelling was undertaken   using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> angle, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> roughness, bearing diameter (horizontal   lever arm) as independent variables. Material loss was mapped using   a coordinate measuring machine, profilometry and scanning electron   microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After adjustment for other factors, CoCr stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>s were found   to have significantly greater volumetric material loss than the   equivalent Ti stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> junction damage is identified during revision of a   LD MoM hip, it should be suspected that a male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> composed of   a standard CoCr alloy has sustained significant changes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>   cone geometry which are likely to be more extensive than those affecting   a Ti alloy stem.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1304–12.</p></sec>

Early performance-based and patient-reported outcomes of a contemporary taper fit bone-conserving short stem femoral component in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare early functional and health   related quality of life outcomes (HRQoL) in patients who have undergone   total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a bone conserving short stem   femoral component and those in whom a conventional length uncemented   component was used. Outcome was assessed using a validated performance   based outcome instrument as well as patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively analysed 33 patients whose THA involved a contemporary   proximally porous coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>ed short stem femoral component and   53 patients with a standard conventional femoral component, at a   minimum follow-up of two years. The mean follow-up was 31.4 months   (24 to 39). Patients with poor proximal femoral bone quality were   excluded. The mean age of the patients was 66.6 years (59 to 77)   and the mean body mass index was 30.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (24.1 to   41.0). Outcome was assessed using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and   the University College Hospital (UCH) hip score which is a validated   performance based instrument. HRQoL was assessed using the EuroQol   5D (EQ-5D).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no major peri-operative complications. There was no   difference in the mean post-operative OHS, EQ-5D or function subscale   of the UCH hip scores between the two groups. The mean pre-operative   OHS and EQ-5D scores improved significantly (all p < 0.001).   The mean functional component of the UCH hip score at final follow-up   was 42.5 and 40.6 in the short stem and conventional stem groups,   respectively. There was no statistically significant difference   between the groups (p = 0.42). A total of seven patients (21.2%)   in the short stem group and nine (16.98%) in the conventional group   achieved a ceiling effect using the OHS; none did using the function   subscale of the UCH hip score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proximally porous coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>ed short stem femoral component   achieves comparable short-term functional outcomes when compared   with a conventional longer stem uncemented femoral component when   THA is undertaken in patients with good bone quality.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):49–55.</p></sec>

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   risk factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>ed   cementless femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   identified. Level of pre-operative osteoarthritis, femoral Dorr   type and cortical index were recorded. Varus/valgus placement of   the stem and canal fill ratio were recorded post-operatively. Periprosthetic   fractures were identified and classified according to the Vancouver   classification. Regression analysis was performed to identify risk   factors for early periprosthetic fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 713 days (1 to 2058). A total of 48 periprosthetic   fractures (3.0%) were identified during the follow-up and median   time until fracture was 16 days, (interquartile range 10 to 31.5).   Patients with femoral Dorr type C had a 5.2 times increased risk   of post-operative periprosthetic fracture compared with type B,   while female patients had a near significant two times increased   risk over time for post-operative fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dorr type C is an independent risk factor for early periprosthetic   fracture, following THA using a double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>ed cementless stem such   as the Bi-Metric.

Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following revision surgery of metal-on-metal   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to metal   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing revision surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following revision were   intra-operative complications, mortality and re-revision surgery.   Predictors of re-revision were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operative complications occurred in 40 revisions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong> adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), ceramic-on-ceramic revision bearings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07). These four factors remained predictive   of re-revision when the missing data were imputed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The short-term risk of re-revision following MoMHA revision surgery   performed for ARMD was comparable with that reported in the NJR   following all-cause non-MoMHA revision surgery. However, the factors   predictive of re-revision included those which could be modified   by the surgeon, suggesting that rates of failure following ARMD revision   may be reduced further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1020–7.</p></sec>

Hip revision arthroplasty for failed osteosynthesis in periprosthetic Vancouver type B1 fractures using a cementless, modular, tapered revision stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the hypothesis that failed osteosynthesis of periprosthetic   Vancouver type B1 fractures can be treated successfully with stem   revision using a transfemoral approach and a cementless, modular,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>ed revision stem with reproducible rates of fracture healing,   stability of the revision stem, and clinically good results.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 14 patients (11 women, three men) with a mean age   of 72.4 years (65 to 90) undergoing revision hip arthroplasty after   failed osteosynthesis of periprosthetic fractures of Vancouver type   B1 were treated using a transfemoral approach to remove the well-fixed   stem before insertion of a modular, fluted titanium stem which obtained   distal fixation. These patients were clinically and radiologically   followed up for a mean 52.2 months (24 to 144).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After a mean of 15.5 weeks (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   5.7) all fractures had healed.

Femoral impaction bone grafting in revision hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral impaction bone grafting was first developed in 1987 using   morselised cancellous bone graft impacted into the femoral canal   in combination with a cemented, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>ed, polished stem. We describe   the evolution of this technique and instrumentation since that time. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1987 and 2005, 705 revision total hip arthroplasties   (56 bilateral) were performed with femoral impaction grafting using   a cemented femoral stem. All surviving patients were prospectively   followed for a mean of 14.7 years (9.8 to 28.3) with no loss to   follow-up. By the time of the final review, 404 patients had died.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 76 further revisions (10.8%) involving the stem; seven   for aseptic loosening, 23 for periprosthetic fracture, 24 for infection,   one for malposition, one for fracture of the stem and 19 cement-in-cement   exchanges of the stem during acetabular revision. The 20-year survival   rate for the entire series was 98.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)   97.8 to 99.8) with aseptic loosening as the endpoint, and 87.7%   (95% CI 82.8 to 92.6) for revision for any reason. Survival improved   with the evolution of the technique, although this was not statistically   significant due to the overall low rate of further revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the largest series of revision total hip arthroplasties   with femoral impaction grafting, and the results support the continued   use of this technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1611–19.</p></sec>

Continuous distal migration and internal rotation of the C-stem prosthesis without any adverse clinical effects
<p>In 2005, we demonstrated that the polished triple-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taper</span></strong>ed   C-stem at two years had migrated distally and rotated internally.   From that series, 33 patients have now been followed radiologically,   clinically and by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) for up to ten   years. The distal migration within the cement mantle had continued   and reached a mean of 2 mm (0.5 to 4.0) at ten years. Internal rotation,   also within the cement mantle, was a mean 3.8° (external 1.6° to   internal 6.6°) The cement mantle did not show any sign of migration   or loosening in relation to the femoral bone. There were no clinical   or radiological signs indicating that the migration or rotation   within the cement mantle had had any adverse effects for the patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:604–8.</p>

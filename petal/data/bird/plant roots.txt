Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> has been shown to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and is hyposensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips displayed higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport in Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth regulation in maize.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels, including inhibition of primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth, induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> nor an anti-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis. Single cell-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport assays showed no inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation, induced by the inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and crop productivity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip geometry and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation rate, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter was not related to genotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> penetration stress and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The Smart<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, the second to rapidly arrested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, and the third to an intermediate type where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> types along the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> type or by the distance from this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>. This random branching pattern of primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> developmental patterns.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending, suggesting that primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending is preceded by the establishment of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. To test the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx in nodulation we used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of developing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravitropism, fewer lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, shorter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s developed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> during nodule formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> is the central component of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene interplay during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravitropism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, PABA promotes an asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> curvature. This activity requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene cross talk necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravitropism.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, leading to alkalization in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, which peaked in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter mutants (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport driven by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast development is repressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s develop chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In wild-type Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development in detached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> represses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening response.</p>

Adaption of Roots to Nitrogen Deficiency Revealed by 3D Quantification and Proteomic Analysis
<p>Rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is an important oil crop worldwide. However, severe inhibition of rapeseed production often occurs in the field due to nitrogen (N) deficiency. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system is the main organ to acquire N for plant growth, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying rapeseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> adaptions to N deficiency. Here, dynamic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architectural traits of N-deficient rapeseed plants were evaluated by 3D in situ quantification. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> proteome responses to N deficiency were analyzed by the tandem mass tag-based proteomics method, and related proteins were characterized further. Under N deficiency, rapeseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s become longer, with denser cells in the meristematic zone and larger cells in the elongation zone of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips, and also become softer with reduced solidity. A total of 171 and 755 differentially expressed proteins were identified in short- and long-term N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, respectively. The abundance of proteins involved in cell wall organization or biogenesis was highly enhanced, but most identified peroxidases were reduced in the N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Notably, peroxidase activities also were decreased, which might promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation while lowering the solidity of N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. These results were consistent with the cell wall components measured in the N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Further functional analysis using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants demonstrated that the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-related differentially expressed proteins contribute to the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth under N deficiency conditions. These results provide insights into the global changes of rapeseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> responses to N deficiency and may facilitate the development of rapeseed cultivars with high N use efficiency through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-based genetic improvements.</p>

The ARF7 and ARF19 Transcription Factors Positively Regulate <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> in Arabidopsis Roots
<p>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a key regulatory component of the response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. However, the regulation of <i>PHR1</i> in this response remains poorly understood. Here, we report that <i>PHR1</i> is a target of the transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and is positively regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. <i>PHR1</i> expression was induced by exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and suppressed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitors in Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In the <i>PHR1</i> promoter, three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-response elements, which are bound directly by ARF7 and ARF19, were shown to be essential for <i>PHR1</i> expression. The <i>arf7</i>, <i>arf19</i>, and <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutants showed down-regulated expression of <i>PHR1</i> and downstream Pi starvation-induced genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s; they also exhibited defective Pi uptake in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and overaccumulation of anthocyanin in shoots. The induction of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> formation in response to low Pi and to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> was decreased in the <i>phr1</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16</i> (<i>LBD16</i>) and <i>LBD29</i> was not changed significantly. PHR1 acted independently of LBD16 and LBD29 in the regulation of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> formation in response to low Pi. Under low-Pi conditions, lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> impairment in the <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutant was partially rescued by constitutive expression of <i>PHR1</i>, demonstrating that reduced <i>PHR1</i> expression contributed to the <i>arf7 arf19</i> phenotype. In addition to <i>PHR1</i>, other genes encoding MYB-CC members also were targets of ARF7 and ARF19. Our work thus reveals a mechanism coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and the PHR1 regulon in Arabidopsis responses to Pi deficiency.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor

Previous studies using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors definitively established that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> plays a central role regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and development. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors affect all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> (LR)-preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport inhibitor response1</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>s, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, facilitated by the combined activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravity responses. Altered expression from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport whereby it imapcts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, its role in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter, a critical indicator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> sensitivity and decreased the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling components.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carriers regulate directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> movement by establishing local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> has been proposed to modulate its own transport by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> affects PIN trafficking by screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> formation via positive regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport.</p>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> Hair Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs and has a conserved role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair formation, based on observations of a short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> Hairless1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development in rice.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitor 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> perception inhibitor <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These inhibitors had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. Inhibitory effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> xylem, and it appeared first in the fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-Distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant’s nitrogen demand for growth. Here, we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate translocation from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. <i>OsMADS57</i> is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, <i>osmads57</i> mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had 2-fold higher levels. Shoot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> <sup>15</sup>N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression lines. Rapid NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> influx experiments showed that mutation of <i>OsMADS57</i> did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> nitrate uptake. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis of <i>OsNRT2</i> nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> (a vascular-specific high-affinity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional <i>NRT2</i> genes (<i>OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4</i>). Conversely, in the overexpression lines, four <i>NRT2</i> genes had much higher expression profiles at all time points tested. As previously reported, <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between <i>OsMADS57</i> and <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif (CATTTTATAG) within the <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> promoter. Moreover, seminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation was inhibited in <i>osmads57</i> mutants, which may be associated with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels in and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.</p>

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth
<p>Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and altered columella cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in <i>ann-mutant</i> cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of <i>ann-mutant</i> primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s was significantly higher than that of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in <i>ann-mutant</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting mineral nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs and attenuated primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. Quantitative protein profiling of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein profiles. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-hair phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>, which may be causative for the alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair morphogenesis. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), harboring a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox homeostasis.</p>

Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12.

Endogenous callus formation precedes specification of postembryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells, from which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s are initiated through the activity of SHORT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing.

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> secondary growth of dicotyledonous species improves phosphorus acquisition. Functional-structural modeling in Sim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> secondary growth reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> metabolic costs, increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus soil. Observations from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary growth improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus soil. Under low phosphorus in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary growth had 39% smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cross-sectional area, 60% less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> respiration, 27% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cross-sectional area, 32% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. Secondary growth eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> secondary growth is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses six <i>LAZY</i> genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> and shoot branch angles and gravitropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the gravitropism mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> branch angle. Lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> axis, and they were agravitropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially agravitropic, but their phototropic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also agravitropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed gravitropic response. A reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>ole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced growth.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> regulates many aspects of growth and development in land plants, but the origin and evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-related pathways diverged before the emergence of land plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of land plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-signaling pathway found in land plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis and of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in land plants.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity application to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex arrests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex compared with the mature zone, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated cation currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Transcription Factors WOX11/12 Directly Activate <i>WOX5/7</i> to Promote Root Primordia Initiation and Organogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>De novo organogenesis, which gives rise to adventitious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and shoots, is a type of plant regeneration for survival after wounding. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), two main cell fate transition steps are required to establish the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium during de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> organogenesis from leaf explants. The first step from regeneration-competent cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells involves activation of <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11</i> (<i>WOX11</i>) and <i>WOX12</i> (<i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i>) expression by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the second step of fate transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the expression levels of <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> decrease while those of <i>WOX5</i> and <i>7</i> (<i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>) increase during the transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium. <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> function genetically upstream of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>, and the WOX11/12 proteins directly bind to the promoters of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> to activate their transcription. Mutations in <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> result in defective primordium formation. Overall, our data indicate that the expression switch from <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> to <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> is critical for initiation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium during de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> organogenesis.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. The explicit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulics.</p>

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses
<p>The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) response pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant development and environmental adaptation. Here, we show that <i>ABI1</i>, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling, is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-modulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> development. We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking. And <i>sHSP22 OX</i> lines initiated more lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> application. Our results suggest that sHSP22 regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response through modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport, and ABI1-sHSP22 provides a novel module orchestrating ABA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling crosstalk in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced <i>SMALL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated elongation. The time courses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. We thus propose that polarly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients.</p>

Our objective was to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions making the greatest contribution to total N uptake in each species as measured by the two contrasting techniques. White and condensed tannin zones were the regions with the smallest surface area in all species, but these zones often had the highest net flux of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. For most species, little variation was found among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions in N flux calculated using a <sup>15</sup>N mass balance approach, but where significant differences existed, high N flux was observed in white, cork or woody zones. When N fluxes measured by each of the two methods were multiplied by the estimated surface area or biomass of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> region, the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> region size had the greatest influence on regional N uptake. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions of greatest overall N uptake were the cork and woody zones, on average.

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Plants release considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc release from plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. We found that the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) released more Glc from the base of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> than from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip and that the Glc release rate is reduced in response to water stress. These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc release in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species. These findings and their implications on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-rhizosphere interactions are discussed.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Arabidopsis Ecotypes Reveals a Role for Brassinosteroids in Root Hydrotropism
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s respond to soil moisture gradients and remodel their growth orientation toward water through hydrotropism, a process vital for acclimation to a changing soil environment. Mechanisms underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydrotropic response, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined hydrotropism in 31 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotypes collected from different parts of the world and grown along moisture gradients in a specially designed soil-simulation system. Comparative transcriptome profiling and physiological analyses were carried out on three selected ecotypes, Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col-0) (strongly hydrotropic), Col-0 (moderately hydrotropic), and C24 (weakly hydrotropic), and in mutant lines with altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydrotropic responses. We show that H<sup>+</sup> efflux, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, and phytohormone signaling may contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydrotropism. Among phytohormones, the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) was examined further. In the presence of an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis, the strong hydrotropic response observed in Ws was reduced. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> H<sup>+</sup> efflux and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation also were inhibited when compared with C24, an ecotype that showed a weak hydrotropic response. The BR-insensitive mutant <i>bri1-5</i> displayed higher rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> curvature on moisture gradients in vertical or oblique orientation when compared with wild-type Ws. We also demonstrate that BRI1 (a BR receptor) interacts with AHA2 (a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) and that their expression patterns are highly coordinated. This synergistic action may contribute to the strong hydrotropism observed in Ws. Our results suggest that BR-associated H<sup>+</sup> efflux is critical in the hydrotropic response of Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic pathway to manipulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> content could be a target for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic engineering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat.</p>

LEAFY Controls Auxin Response Pathways in Floral Primordium Formation
<sec><title>Signals to Blossom</title><p>In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) stimulates flower development, and the formation of floral and leaf primordial tissue is stimulated by the hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>.

MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 Enhance Drought Tolerance by Modulating Root Vessels and Cell Walls in Apple
<p>Water deficit is one of the main limiting factors in apple (<i>Malus</i> × <i>domestica</i> Borkh.) cultivation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architecture plays an important role in the drought tolerance of plants; however, research efforts to improve drought tolerance of apple trees have focused on aboveground targets. Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architecture of apple trees under drought conditions. We previously observed that MdMYB88 and its paralog MdMYB124 regulate apple tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphology. In this study, we found that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 play important roles in maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulic conductivity under long-term drought conditions and therefore contribute toward adaptive drought tolerance. Further investigation revealed that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> xylem development by directly binding <i>MdVND6</i> and <i>MdMYB46</i> promoters and thus influence expression of their target genes under drought conditions. In addition, MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 were shown to regulate the deposition of cellulose and lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cell walls in response to drought. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the importance of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architecture, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> xylem development, and secondary cell wall deposition in response to drought in apple trees.</p>

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> size and architecture are important crop plant traits, as they determine access to water and soil nutrients. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> functions. This was achieved through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s did not penalize shoot growth or seed yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low soil mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, seeds contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term drought conditions, indicating lower drought sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve nutrient efficiency, biofortification, and drought tolerance.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system strongly depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of salt. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> module is a key regulator, via modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to salt stress.</p>

Large Crown Root Number Improves Topsoil Foraging and Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genotypes with large crown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> number (CN) will have shallower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing depth and improved P acquisition from low-P soils. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> respiration, 24% shallower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing depth, 32% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing depth, 51% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing depth and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth requires polar nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling via the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear migration in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> epidermal hair cells.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>Sim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong></i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of older plants had very little living cortical volume per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic program for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development genes, relative to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair tip growth. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair initiation and tip growth in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair tip growth. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s exposed to 4% oxygen, causing structural abnormalities in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of programmed cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric oxide and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane oxidase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death programs in eukaryotes, and restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. Hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric oxide and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

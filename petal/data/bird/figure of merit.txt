Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion covering all major types of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. We find that the estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of both purifying and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion are species-specific, with signatures of balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in humans within its larger evolutionary context. The global map of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in our closest living relatives is available as an interactive browser at <ext-link>http://tinyurl.com/nf8qmzh</ext-link>.</p>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance of radiographic   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA).

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest pressure remain to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a pressure on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressure. Analysis of <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressure had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies. To improve water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ing for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on stomatal conductance.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for either an increase or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian children using these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> and to compare the findings with a group of Australian children at low risk for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed on high-risk Indigenous children aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia. A comparison group of low-risk, non-Indigenous children living in urban centers was also screened. Echocardiograms were reported in a standardized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-risk children, 34 met World Heart Federation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for definite RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-risk children, none met the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for definite RHD, and 5 met the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> for borderline RHD.

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">qualiti</span></strong>es of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated. A comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance. For network inference, correlation methods <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance compared to single networks.</p>

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive fibrosis in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), fibrosis (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

Carrier lifetimes of >1 μs in Sn-Pb perovskites enable efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells
<p>All-perovskite–based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells have the potential to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies of >30%. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance of all-perovskite–based tandem devices has been limited by the lack of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, low–band gap tin-lead (Sn-Pb) mixed-perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We found that the addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) resulted in marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of Sn-Pb mixed, low–band gap (~1.25 electron volt) perovskite films. The films have defect densities that are lower by a factor of 10, leading to carrier lifetimes of greater than 1 microsecond and diffusion lengths of 2.5 micrometers. These improved properties enable our demonstration of >20% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent low–band gap PSCs. When combined with wider–band gap PSCs, we achieve 25% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent four-terminal and 23.1% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent two-terminal all-perovskite–based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds

We recorded basal ganglia–projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants out<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short reads from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides reliable allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Selective Sweeps across Twenty Millions Years of Primate Evolution
<p>The contribution from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps to variation in genetic diversity has proven notoriously difficult to assess, in part because polymorphism data only allows detection of sweeps in the most recent few hundred thousand years. Here, we show how linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in ancestral species can be quantified across evolutionary timescales by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing patterns of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) along the genomes of closely related species. We show that sweeps in the human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors can be identified as depletions of ILS in regions in excess of 100 kb in length. Sweeps predicted in each ancestral species, as well as recurrent sweeps predicted in both species, often overlap sweeps predicted in humans. This suggests that many genomic regions experience recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps. By comparing the ILS patterns along the genomes of the closely related human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors, we are further able to quantify the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps relative to that of background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Compared with the human–orangutan ancestor, the human–chimpanzee ancestor shows a strong excess of regions depleted of ILS as well as a stronger reduction in ILS around genes. We conclude that sweeps play a strong role in reducing diversity along the genome and that sweeps have reduced diversity in the human–chimpanzee ancestor much more than in the human–orangutan ancestor.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is thought to be less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in the mt genome. Because high levels of gene expression constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt genes are expressed more highly than nuclear genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear genes from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt gene content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt genes than nuclear genes, regardless of which genes happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es between mt and nuclear genes could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong> for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated several progression algorithms in our un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year risk: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to risk prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and risk factor assessment.

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality.

Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month.

The institutional research ethics committee approved the study, and parental consent was obtained. Assuming a diagnostic accuracy of 50%, 400 cases were required for a 5% precision of estimate. Three cases were excluded from analysis, 2 with no conventional autopsy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed and 1 with insufficient CMR sequences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed. Thirty-eight CMR data sets were nondiagnostic (37 in fetuses ≤24 weeks; 1 in a fetus >24 weeks). In the remaining 359 cases, 44 cardiac abnormalities were noted at autopsy.

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>able information about natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and more widespread positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong> pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong> were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">criteria</span></strong>. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included.

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Fractional Flow Reserve–Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome compared with medical therapy (MT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but PCI was guided by angiography alone. FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel E<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ation) compared PCI guided by fractional flow reserve with best MT in patients with stable coronary artery disease to assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 888 patients with stable single-vessel or multivessel coronary artery disease with reduced fractional flow reserve were randomly assigned to PCI plus MT (n=447) or MT alone (n=441). Major adverse cardiac events included death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Costs were calculated on the basis of resource use and Medicare reimbursement rates. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years were assessed with utilities determined by the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions health survey at baseline and over follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Major adverse cardiac events at 3 years were significantly lower in the PCI group compared with the MT group (10.1% versus 22.0%; <i>P</i><0.001), primarily as a result of a lower rate of urgent revascularization (4.3% versus 17.2%; <i>P</i><0.001). Death and myocardial infarction were numerically lower in the PCI group (8.3% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.28). Angina was significantly less severe in the PCI group at all follow-up points to 3 years. Mean initial costs were higher in the PCI group ($9944 versus $4440; <i>P</i><0.001) but by 3 years were similar between the 2 groups ($16 792 versus $16 737; <i>P</i>=0.94). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCI compared with MT was $17 300 per quality-adjusted life-year at 2 years and $1600 per quality-adjusted life-year at 3 years. The above findings were robust in sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>ConclusionS:</title><p>PCI of lesions with reduced fractional flow reserve improves long-term outcome and is economically attractive compared with MT alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Canagliflozin for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that significantly reduces the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk. The comparative effects among participants with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (secondary versus primary prevention) were prespecified for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) randomly assigned 10 142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus to canagliflozin or placebo. The primary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥50 years of age with ≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular events but with no prior cardiovascular event, and the secondary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥30 years of age with a prior cardiovascular event. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included heart failure hospitalization and a renal composite (40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, renal replacement therapy, or renal death).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Primary prevention participants (N=3486; 34%) were younger (63 versus 64 years of age), were more often female (45% versus 31%), and had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary prevention participants (N=6656; 66%). The primary end point event rate was higher in the secondary prevention group compared with the primary prevention group (36.9 versus 15.7/1000 patient-years, <i>P</i><0.001). In the total cohort, the primary end point was reduced with canagliflozin compared with placebo (26.9 versus 31.5/1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.97; <i>P</i><0.001 for noninferiority, <i>P</i>=0.02 for superiority) with no statistical evidence of heterogeneity (interaction <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e=0.18) between the primary (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74–1.30) and secondary prevention (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95) cohorts.

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported.

Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not different.

Novel Desmin Mutation p.Glu401Asp Impairs Filament Formation, Disrupts Cell Membrane Integrity, and Causes Severe Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Desmin (<i>DES</i>) mutations cause severe skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with heterogeneous phenotypes. Recently, <i>DES</i> mutations were described in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, although their cellular and molecular pathomechanisms are not precisely known. Our aim is to describe clinically and functionally the novel <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation as a cause of inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified the novel <i>DES</i> mutation p.Glu401Asp in a large Spanish family with inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia and a high incidence of adverse cardiac events. A full clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed on all mutation carriers and noncarriers to establish clinical and genetic cosegregation.

Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured from 2 family members with the <i>DES</i> mutation (1 with mild and 1 with severe symptomatology) and a member without the mutation (control) and differentiated ex vivo to cardiomyocytes. Then, important genes related to cardiac differentiation and function were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for patients with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital transfer to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic E<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital transfer or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and transfer patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 patients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for transfer patients (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the transfer group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0–1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of direct patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of transfer patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.92; <i>P</i>=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for transfer; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all transferred patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed directly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital transfer was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Prolonged milk provisioning in a jumping spider
<p>Lactation is a mammalian attribute, and the few known nonmammal examples have distinctly different modalities. We document here milk provisioning in a jumping spider, which compares functionally and behaviorally to lactation in mammals. The spiderlings ingest nutritious milk droplets secreted from the mother’s epigastric furrow until the subadult stage. Milk is indispensable for offspring survival in the early stages and complements their foraging in later stages. Maternal care, as for some long-lived vertebrates, continues after the offspring reach maturity. Furthermore, a female-biased adult sex ratio is acquired only when the mother is present. These findings demonstrate that mammal-like milk provisioning and parental care for sexually mature offspring have also evolved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates, encouraging a reevaluation of their occurrence across the animal kingdom, especially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates.</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>isms (including plant pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with plants) promote photosynthesis, growth, and the accumulation of high levels of starch in leaves through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants not exposed to VCs, plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of photosynthesis and growth, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of plastidic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in leaves. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of plants to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis plants cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth, photosynthesis, and the accumulation of plastidic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves accumulated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in photosynthesis, starch metabolism, and growth that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> plants. The overall data show that Arabidopsis plants can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>isms by triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong> <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

Dual phosphorylation of Ric-8A enhances its ability to mediate G protein α subunit folding and to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange
<p>Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase-8A (Ric-8A) and Ric-8B are essential biosynthetic chaperones for heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. We provide evidence for the direct regulation of Ric-8A cellular activity by dual phosphorylation. Using proteomics, Western blotting, and mutational analyses, we determined that Ric-8A was constitutively phosphorylated at five serines and threonines by the protein kinase CK2. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> in rat Ric-8A (corresponding to Ser<sup>436</sup> and Thr<sup>441</sup> in human Ric-8A) was required for high-affinity binding to Gα subunits, efficient stimulation of Gα subunit guanine nucleotide exchange, and mediation of Gα subunit folding. The CK2 consensus sites that contain Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> are conserved in Ric-8 homologs from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s to mammals. We found that the homologous residues in mouse Ric-8B, Ser<sup>468</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, were also phosphorylated. Mutation of the genomic copy of <i>ric-8</i> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to encode alanine in the homologous sites resulted in characteristic <i>ric-8</i> reduction-of-function phenotypes that are associated with defective G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> signaling, including reduced locomotion and defective egg laying. The <i>C. elegans ric-8</i> phosphorylation site mutant phenotypes were partially rescued by chemical stimulation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling. These results indicate that dual phosphorylation represents a critical form of conserved Ric-8 regulation and demonstrate that Ric-8 proteins are needed for effective Gα signaling. The position of the CK2-phosphorylated sites within a structural model of Ric-8A reveals that these sites contribute to a key acidic and negatively charged surface that may be important for its interactions with Gα subunits.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease
<p>Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs) are protein crystals produced by human eosinophils, immune cells typically associated with allergy and parasitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong> (helminth) infection. These responses involve the “type 2” arm of the immune system, and CLCs are a hallmark of the more severe pathologies that can occur during type 2 inflammation, such as allergic asthma. Although described over 160 years ago, the biological relevance of CLCs to type 2 immunity has remained unknown. On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They demonstrate that the crystals, but not the soluble proteins, are powerful promoters of allergic inflammation and can be targeted with crystal-dissolving antibodies to reverse disease symptoms.</p>

Acoel genome reveals the regulatory landscape of whole-body regeneration
<p>Whole-body regeneration is accompanied by complex transcriptomic changes, yet the chromatin regulatory landscapes that mediate this dynamic response remain unexplored. To decipher the regulatory logic that orchestrates regeneration, we sequenced the genome of the acoel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong> <i>Hofstenia miamia</i>, a highly regenerative member of the sister lineage of other bilaterians. Epigenomic profiling revealed thousands of regeneration-responsive chromatin regions and identified dynamically bound transcription factor motifs, with the early growth response (EGR) binding site as the most variably accessible during <i>Hofstenia</i> regeneration. Combining <i>egr</i> inhibition with chromatin profiling suggests that Egr functions as a pioneer factor to directly regulate early wound-induced genes. The genetic connections inferred by this approach allowed the construction of a gene regulatory network for whole-body regeneration, enabling genomics-based comparisons of regeneration across species.</p>

Impacts of historical warming on marine fisheries production
<p>Climate change is altering habitats for marine fishes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates, but the net effect of these changes on potential food production is unknown. We used temperature-dependent population models to measure the influence of warming on the productivity of 235 populations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some populations responded significantly positively (<i>n</i> = 9 populations) and others responded significantly negatively (<i>n</i> = 19 populations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35%. Outcomes of fisheries management—including long-term food provisioning—will be improved by accounting for changing productivity in a warmer ocean.</p>

Termites mitigate the effects of drought in tropical rainforest
<p>Termites perform key ecological functions in tropical ecosystems, are strongly affected by variation in rainfall, and respond negatively to habitat disturbance. However, it is not known how the projected increase in frequency and severity of droughts in tropical rainforests will alter termite communities and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Using a large-scale termite suppression experiment, we found that termite activity and abundance increased during drought in a Bornean forest. This increase resulted in accelerated litter decomposition, elevated soil moisture, greater soil nutrient heterogeneity, and higher seedling survival rates during the extreme El Niño drought of 2015–2016. Our work shows how an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ate group enhances ecosystem resistance to drought, providing evidence that the dual stressors of climate change and anthropogenic shifts in biotic communities will have various negative consequences for the maintenance of rainforest ecosystems.</p>

Light-driven fine chemical production in yeast biohybrids
<p>Inorganic-biological hybrid systems have potential to be sustainable, efficient, and versatile chemical synthesis platforms by integrating the light-harvesting properties of semiconductors with the synthetic potential of biological cells.

The yeast harvests photogenerated electrons from the illuminated nanoparticles and uses them for the cytosolic regeneration of redox cofactors. This process enables the decoupling of biosynthesis and cofactor regeneration, facilitating a carbon- and energy-efficient production of the metabolite shikimic acid, a common precursor for several drugs and fine chemicals. Our work provides a platform for the rational design of biohybrids for efficient biomanufacturing processes with higher complexity and functionality.</p>

The nearshore cradle of early vertebrate diversification
<p>Ancestral vertebrate habitats are subject to controversy and obscured by limited, often contradictory paleontological data. We assembled fossil vertebrate occurrence and habitat datasets spanning the middle Paleozoic (480 million to 360 million years ago) and found that early vertebrate clades, both jawed and jawless, originated in restricted, shallow intertidal-subtidal environments. Nearshore divergences gave rise to body plans with different dispersal abilities: Robust fishes shifted shoreward, whereas gracile groups moved seaward. Fresh waters were invaded repeatedly, but movement to deeper waters was contingent upon form and short-lived until the later Devonian. Our results contrast with the onshore-offshore trends, reef-centered diversification, and mid-shelf clustering observed for benthic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates. Nearshore origins for vertebrates may be linked to the demands of their mobility and may have influenced the structure of their early fossil record and diversification.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic interaction mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that genes interact with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic interactions in yeast in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene interactions for growth. This study shows that higher-order genetic interactions are abundant, which has implications for the interpretation of human gene variants that may interact to affect health and disease.</p>

Dicer uses distinct modules for recognizing dsRNA termini
<p>Invertebrates rely on Dicer to cleave viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and <i>Drosophila</i> Dicer-2 distinguishes dsRNA substrates by their termini. Blunt termini promote processive cleavage, while 3′ overhanging termini are cleaved distributively. To understand this discrimination, we used cryo–electron microscopy to solve structures of <i>Drosophila</i> Dicer-2 alone and in complex with blunt dsRNA. Whereas the Platform-PAZ domains have been considered the only Dicer domains that bind dsRNA termini, unexpectedly, we found that the helicase domain is required for binding blunt, but not 3′ overhanging, termini. We further showed that blunt dsRNA is locally unwound and threaded through the helicase domain in an adenosine triphosphate–dependent manner. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for optimizing antiviral defense and set the stage for the discovery of helicase-dependent functions in other Dicers.</p>

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p>Carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>isms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global carbon cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean’s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite oxidation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite oxidation may have a greater impact on the carbon cycle than previously assumed.</p>

Pyocyanin degradation by a tautomerizing demethylase inhibits <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms
<p>The opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> produces colorful redox-active metabolites called phenazines, which underpin biofilm development, virulence, and clinical outcomes. Although phenazines exist in many forms, the best studied is pyocyanin. Here, we describe pyocyanin demethylase (PodA), a hitherto uncharacterized protein that oxidizes the pyocyanin methyl group to formaldehyde and reduces the pyrazine ring via an unusual tautomerizing demethylation reaction. Treatment with PodA disrupts <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation similarly to DNase, suggesting interference with the pyocyanin-dependent release of extracellular DNA into the matrix. PodA-dependent pyocyanin demethylation also restricts established biofilm aggregate populations experiencing anoxic conditions. Together, these results show that modulating extracellular redox-active metabolites can influence the fitness of a biofilm-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>ism.</p>

Ecological speciation of bacteriophage lambda in allopatry and sympatry

When evolving on both hosts together (sympatry), the viruses split into two lineages with divergent receptor preferences. Although the level of divergence varied among replicates, some lineages evolved reproductive isolation via genetic incompatibilities. This outcome indicates that, under suitable conditions, allopatric and sympatric speciation can occur with similar ease.</p>

Unexpected rewards induce dopamine-dependent positive emotion–like state changes in bumblebees

In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These behavioral changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of emotions and may alter the view of how emotion states affect decision-making in animals.</p>

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong> <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>isms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">worm</span></strong>s, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of <i>OsGEN1</i> and <i>OsSEND1</i>, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (<i>Oryza</i> <i>sativa</i>). We first investigated the role of <i>OsGEN1</i> during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ∼6% in <i>osgen1</i> mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the <i>osgen1</i> mutant concomitant with an increase in double-strand breaks. Persistent double-strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of <i>OsSEND1</i> had no effects on plant development and did not enhance <i>osgen1</i> defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.</p>

Evolution of Digestive Enzymes and RNASE1 Provides Insights into Dietary Switch of Cetaceans
<p>Although cetaceans (whales, porpoises, and dolphins) have multi-chambered stomachs, feeding habits of modern cetaceans have dramatically changed from herbivorous to carnivorous. However, the genetic basis underlying this dietary switch remains unexplored. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of 10 digestive enzymes genes (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>CTRC</i>, <i>LIPC</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, <i>PNLIP</i>, <i>PGC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, <i>SI</i>, <i>SLC5A1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) of representative cetaceans, and the evolutionary trajectory of <i>RNASE1</i> in cetartiodactylans. Positive selections were detected with proteinases (i.e., <i>CTRC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) and lipases (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, and <i>PNLIP</i>) suggesting that cetaceans have evolved an enhanced digestion capacity for proteins and lipids, the major nutritional components of their prey (fishes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates). In addition, it was found that <i>RNASE1</i> gene duplicated after the cetartiodactylan speciation and two independent gene duplication events took place in Camelidae and Ruminantia. Positive selection was detected with <i>RNASE1</i> of Camelidae and Bovidae, suggesting enhanced digestive efficiency in the ruminants. Remarkably, even though the ancestors of cetaceans were terrestrial artiodactyls that are herbivorous, modern cetaceans lost the pancreatic <i>RNASE1</i> copy with digestive function, which is in accordance with the dietary change from herbivorous to carnivorous. In sum, this is the first study that provides new insights into the evolutionary mechanism of dietary switch in cetaceans.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>: evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure
<p>During aerial exposure (emersion), most sessile intertidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates experience cellular stress caused by hypoxia, and the amount and types of hypoxia-induced stress will differ as exposure time increases, likely leading to altered metabolic responses. We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion times and decreasing recovery (immersion) times in the mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean tide level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring tides. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated. We conclude that <i>G. demissa</i> alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over time, relying on anaerobic metabolism for short- to medium-duration exposure, but switching to an air-gaping strategy for long-term exposure, which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>isms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

BEND6 is a nuclear antagonist of Notch signaling during self-renewal of neural stem cells
<p>The activity of the Notch pathway revolves around a CSL-class transcription factor, which recruits distinct complexes that activate or repress target gene expression. The co-activator complex is deeply conserved and includes the cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Mastermind. By contrast, numerous CSL co-repressor proteins have been identified, and these are mostly different between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ate and vertebrate systems. In this study, we demonstrate that mammalian BEND6 is a neural BEN-solo factor that shares many functional attributes with <i>Drosophila</i> Insensitive, a co-repressor for the <i>Drosophila</i> CSL factor. BEND6 binds the mammalian CSL protein CBF1 and antagonizes Notch-dependent target activation. In addition, its association with Notch- and CBF1-regulated enhancers is promoted by CBF1 and antagonized by activated Notch. <i>In utero</i> electroporation experiments showed that ectopic BEND6 inhibited Notch-mediated self-renewal of neocortical neural stem cells and promoted neurogenesis. Conversely, knockdown of BEND6 increased NSC self-renewal in wild-type neocortex, and exhibited genetic interactions with gain and loss of Notch pathway activity. We recapitulated all of these findings in cultured neurospheres, in which overexpression and depletion of BEND6 caused reciprocal effects on neural stem cell renewal and neurogenesis. These data reveal a novel mammalian CSL co-repressor in the nervous system, and show that the Notch-inhibitory activity of certain BEN-solo proteins is conserved between flies and mammals.</p>

Analysis of the shape fluctuations of reconstituted membranes using GUVs made from lipid extracts of invertebrates
<p>Changes in the physical properties of the lipid matrix of cell membranes have repeatedly been proposed to underlie stresses associated with e.g. drought, cold and xenobiotics.

Here, we test the analysis of shape fluctuations in membranes composed of lipid extracts from two soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates, and show that theories and experimental approaches previously developed for simpler liposomes may be applied directly to reconstituted membrane lipids. Specifically, we show how the bending rigidity of giant unilamellar liposomes of lipid extracts can be determined precisely. We suggest that future measurements of this parameter could elucidate mechanisms of adaptive processes such as changes in lipid composition and accumulation of protective osmolytes.</p>

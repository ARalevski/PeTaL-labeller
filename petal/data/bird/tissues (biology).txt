Opposing Actions of Fibroblast and Cardiomyocyte Smad3 Signaling in the Infarcted Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transforming growth factor–βs regulate a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular responses by activating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent cascades. In the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed heart, Smad3 signaling is activated in both cardiomyocytes and interstitial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific actions of Smad3 regulate repair and remodeling in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To dissect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific Smad3 actions in myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion, we generated mice with Smad3 loss in activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was assessed after reperfused or nonreperfused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion using echocardiography. The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific Smad3 loss on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed heart were studied using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histolog</span></strong>ical studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smad-independent actions in isolated cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mice with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>-specific Smad3 loss had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion and exhibited an increased incidence of late rupture after nonreperfused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion. The consequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>-specific Smad3 loss were not a result of effects on acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong> size but were associated with unrestrained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> proliferation, impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scar</span></strong> remodeling, reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>-derived collagen synthesis, and perturbed alignment of myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> arrays in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>. Polarized light microscopy in Sirius red–stained sections demonstrated that the changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> morphology were associated with perturbed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of the collagenous matrix in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed area. In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin expression by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong> myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s was not affected by Smad3 loss. Smad3 critically regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> function, activating integrin-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase–2 (NOX-2) expression. Smad3 loss in cardiomyocytes attenuated remodeling and dysfunction after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion. Cardiomyocyte-specific Smad3 loss did not affect acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong> size but was associated with attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium, accompanied by decreased myocardial NOX-2 levels, reduced nitrosative stress, and lower matrix metalloproteinase–2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healing myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion, myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>- and cardiomyocyte-specific activation of Smad3 has contrasting functional outcomes that may involve activation of an integrin/reactive oxygen axis.</p></sec>

SOX17 Regulates Conversion of Human Fibroblasts Into Endothelial Cells and Erythroblasts by Dedifferentiation Into CD34<sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and lineage conversion of adult human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s into functional endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s have not yet been fully defined.

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> depletion and granulocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses. The effect of impaired dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s and ventricular function were assessed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histolog</span></strong>y and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e colony-stimulating factor–producing B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>s into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> depletion or granulocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

Pathologic Stimulus Determines Lineage Commitment of Cardiac C-kit<sup>+</sup> Cells

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion. It is generally thought that migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s grab and exert traction force onto the extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix in order to pull the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrate efficiently, whether these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exert traction forces during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s maintained similar actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and focal adhesions as wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated force-generating machinery, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s move with minimal traction forces at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to adapt and migrate.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased protein translation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and various factors in the tumor microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow–derived myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es, and dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that facilitates protumorigenic characteristics in culture and tumor growth in vivo. We investigated whether this inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and what its functional consequences were within the tumor. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that included the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s gave rise to faster growing tumors than did vehicle-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular communication through which tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

EMC10 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 10) Is a Bone Marrow–Derived Angiogenic Growth Factor Promoting Tissue Repair After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials of bone marrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–based therapies after acute myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific bone marrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–derived secreted proteins may provide an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI. We recently performed a bioinformatic secretome analysis in bone marrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from patients with acute MI and discovered a poorly characterized secreted protein, EMC10 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex subunit 10), showing activity in an angiogenic screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the angiogenic potential of EMC10 and its mouse homolog (Emc10) in cultured endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed heart explants.

Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic potential of recombinant Emc10 delivered by osmotic minipumps after MI in heart failure–prone FVB/N mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Emc10 signaled through small GTPases, p21-activated kinase, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) pathway to promote actin polymerization and endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration. Confirming the importance of these signaling events in the context of acute MI, Emc10 stimulated endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> outgrowth from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed mouse heart explants via p38 MAPK-MK2. Emc10 protein abundance was increased in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed region of the left ventricle and in the circulation of wild-type mice after MI. Emc10 expression was also increased in left ventricular tissue samples from patients with acute MI. Bone marrow–derived monocytes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es were the predominant sources of Emc10 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed murine heart. <i>Emc10</i> KO mice showed no cardiovascular phenotype at baseline. After MI, however, capillarization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong> border zone was impaired in KO mice, and the animals developed larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scar</span></strong>s and more pronounced left ventricular remodeling compared with wild-type mice.

TSLP signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state
<p>Pathogenic T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which produce increased amounts of the cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, stimulates such pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s initiated transcriptional changes associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> programming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–programmed T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stimulated with IL-4 alone. TSLP-mediated T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had exacerbated pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses upon exposure to house dust mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor–deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.

IL-2Rβ abundance differentially tunes IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulates both activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to proliferate. IL-2 signals through an identical receptor complex and promotes the same dose-dependent phosphorylation of the canonical transcription factor STAT5 in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types. Despite this, CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s enter the S phase earlier and proliferate to a greater extent than do CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in response to IL-2. We identified distinct IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In IL-2–stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, STAT5 phosphorylation increased rapidly and was sustained for 6 hours. In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a biphasic response, with maxima at 15 min and 2 to 4 hours after stimulation. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types required vesicular trafficking, but only CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s required new protein synthesis to maintain high phosphorylation of STAT5. Two subunits of the IL-2 receptor, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, were twice as abundant in CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Reduction of IL-2Rβ abundance by 50% was sufficient to convert CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–like signaling pattern and delay S phase entry. These results suggest that the larger pool of IL-2Rβ chains in CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is required to sustain IL-2 signaling and contributes to the quantitatively greater proliferative response to IL-2 relative to that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type–specific difference in IL-2Rβ abundance appears to tune responses, potentially preventing extensive, autoimmune proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, while still enabling sufficient proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to control viral infections.</p>

<p>Maintenance of mammary functional capacity during cycles of proliferation and regression depends on appropriate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate decisions of mammary progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to populate an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epithelium</span></strong> consisting of secretory luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and contractile myoepithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. It is well established that transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) restricts mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> proliferation and that sensitivity to TGFβ is decreased in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. We show that TGFβ also exerts control of mammary progenitor self-renewal and lineage commitment decisions by stringent regulation of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> associated 1 (BRCA1), which controls stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> self-renewal and lineage commitment. Either genetic depletion of <i>Tgfb1</i> or transient blockade of TGFβ increased self-renewal of mammary progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in mice, cultured primary mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and also skewed lineage commitment toward the myoepithelial fate. TGFβ stabilized the abundance of BRCA1 by reducing the abundance of microRNA-182 (miR-182). Ectopic expression of BRCA1 or antagonism of miR-182 in cultured TGFβ-deficient mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s restored luminal lineage commitment. These findings reveal that TGFβ modulation of BRCA1 directs mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate and, because stem or progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are thought to be the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> of origin for aggressive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> subtypes, suggest that TGFβ dysregulation during tumorigenesis may promote distinct breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> subtypes.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (APCs) through the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and the activation of the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Activated T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s proliferate and differentiate into effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that secrete cytokines, provide help to B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and kill target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s versus naive (unstimulated) T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which resulted in naive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and groups of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular and molecular control of a lobed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall generate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape and are unstable at the time scales of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> geometry, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and pattern formation within a multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ism rely on coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate determination. In animals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fates are mainly determined by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, positional information is thought to be the primary determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fates. However, our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histolog</span></strong>ical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>cal studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single layer of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> layers that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate determination in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern formation. The inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> identity can subsequently be removed or modified by positional information. The instruction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate conversion is not a fast readout during root development. The final identity of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type is determined by the synergistic contribution from multiple layers of regulation, including symplastic communication across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate instruction.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> array. A key event in the process that generates this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> divisions, and the resulting daughter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division, daughter chondrocytes establish a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> spreading than to migration. Column formation requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> polarity, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of daughter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

CD73 on T Cells Orchestrates Cardiac Wound Healing After Myocardial Infarction by Purinergic Metabolic Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are required for proper healing after myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion. The mechanism of their beneficial action, however, is unknown. The proinflammatory danger signal ATP, released from damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, is degraded by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. Here, we investigate the contribution of CD73-derived adenosine produced by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion and define its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Myocardial ischemia (50 minutes followed by reperfusion) was induced in global CD73<sup>−/−</sup> and CD4-CD73<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice. Tissue injury, T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> purinergic signaling, cytokines, and cardiac function (magnetic resonance tomography at 9.4 T over 4 weeks) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Changes in functional parameters of CD4-CD73<sup>−/−</sup> mice were identical to those in global CD73 knockouts (KOs). T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s infiltrating the injured heart significantly upregulated at the gene (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein (enzymatic activity) levels critical transporters and enzymes (connexin43, connexin37, pannexin-1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, CD39, CD73, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3, CD157, CD38) for the accelerated release and hydrolysis of ATP, cAMP, AMP, and NAD to adenosine. It is surprising that a lack of CD39 on T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (from CD39<sup>−/−</sup> mice) did not alter ATP hydrolysis and very likely involves pyrophosphatases (ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3). Circulating T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s predominantly expressed A<sub>2a</sub> receptor (A<sub>2a</sub>R) transcripts. After myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion, A<sub>2b</sub> receptor (A<sub>2b</sub>R) transcription was induced in both T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the heart. Thus, A<sub>2a</sub>R and A<sub>2b</sub>R signaling may contribute to myocardial responses after myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion. In the case of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, this was associated with an accelerated secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines (interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and interleukin-17) when CD73 was lacking. Cytokine production by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from peripheral lymph nodes was inhibited by A<sub>2a</sub>R activation (CGS-21680). The A<sub>2b</sub>R agonist BAY 60-6583 showed off-target effects. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA inhibited interferon-γ and stimulated interleukin-6 production, each of which was antagonized by a specific A<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist (PSB-603).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work demonstrates that CD73 on T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s plays a crucial role in the cardiac wound healing process after myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion. The underlying mechanism involves a profound increase in the hydrolysis of ATP/NAD and AMP, resulting primarily from the upregulation of pyrophosphatases and CD73. We also define A<sub>2b</sub>R/A<sub>2a</sub>R–mediated autacoid feedback inhibition of proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–derived CD73.</p></sec>

R-Ras2 is required for germinal center formation to aid B cells during energetically demanding processes
<p>Upon antigen recognition within peripheral lymphoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s interact with T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and other immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to transiently form morphological structures called germinal centers (GCs), which are required for B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> clonal expansion, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation. This process, known as the GC response, is an energetically demanding process that requires the metabolic reprogramming of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We showed that the Ras-related guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) R-Ras2 (also known as TC21) plays an essential, nonredundant, and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–intrinsic role in the GC response. Both the conversion of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and their expansion were impaired in mice lacking R-Ras2, but not in those lacking a highly related R-Ras subfamily member or both the classic H-Ras and N-Ras GTPases. In the absence of R-Ras2, activated B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s did not exhibit increased oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic glycolysis. We showed that R-Ras2 was an effector of both the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor (BCR) and CD40 and that, in its absence, B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exhibited impaired activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway, reduced mitochondrial DNA replication, and decreased expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism. Because most human B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lymphomas originate from GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s or B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that have undergone the GC response, our data suggest that R-Ras2 may also regulate metabolism in B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> malignancies.</p>

Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A
<p>Educated natural killer (NK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s have inhibitory receptors specific for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and kill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s more efficiently than do NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through education has so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> level are lacking. We developed a refined version of the image mean square displacement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet analysis) and used it in combination with single-particle tracking to characterize the dynamics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor Ly49A on resting educated versus hyporesponsive murine NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Most of the NKp46 and Ly49A molecules were restricted to microdomains; however, individual NKp46 molecules resided in these domains for shorter periods and diffused faster on the surface of educated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s compared to hyporesponsive NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or adding cholesterol to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that the dynamics of receptor movements within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> membrane are critical for the proper activation of NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. The faster and more dynamic movement of NKp46 in educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression

K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Innate antigen-presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and adaptive immune T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s have been implicated in the development of hypertension. However, the T-lymphocyte subsets involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension remain unclear. A small subset of innate-like T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing the γδ T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor (TCR) rather than the αβ TCR could play a role in the initiation of the immune response in hypertension. We aimed to determine whether angiotensin (Ang) II caused kinetic changes in γδ T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s; deficiency in γδ T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s blunted Ang II-induced hypertension, vascular injury, and T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation; and γδ T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are associated with human hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Male C57BL/6 wild-type and <i>Tcrδ</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which are devoid of γδ T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, or wild-type mice injected IP with control isotype IgG or γδ T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-depleting antibodies, were infused or not with Ang II for 3, 7, or 14 days. T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> profiling was determined by flow cytometry, systolic blood pressure (SBP) by telemetry, and mesentery artery endothelial function by pressurized myography. TCR γ constant region gene expression levels and clinical data of a whole blood gene expression microarray study, including normotensive and hypertensive subjects, were used to demonstrate an association between γδ T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and SBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven- and 14-day Ang II infusion increased γδ T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> numbers and activation in the spleen of wild-type mice (<i>P</i><0.05). Fourteen days of Ang II infusion increased SBP (<i>P</i><0.01) and decreased mesenteric artery endothelial function (<i>P</i><0.01) in wild-type mice, both of which were abrogated in <i>Tcrδ</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<i>P</i><0.01). Anti-TCRγδ antibody-induced γδ T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> depletion blunted Ang II-induced SBP rise and endothelial dysfunction (<i>P</i><0.05), compared with isotype antibody-treated Ang II-infused mice.

A defect in KCa3.1 channel activity limits the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cancer patients to infiltrate an adenosine-rich microenvironment
<p>The limited ability of cytotoxic T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to infiltrate solid tumors hampers immune surveillance and the efficacy of immunotherapies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Adenosine accumulates in solid tumors and inhibits tumor-specific T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Adenosine inhibits T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> motility through the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and suppression of KCa3.1 channels. We conducted three-dimensional chemotaxis experiments to elucidate the effect of adenosine on the migration of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from head and neck squamous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced in the presence of adenosine, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than on healthy donor (HD) CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This response correlated with the inability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to infiltrate tumors. The effect of adenosine was mimicked by an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist and prevented by an A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist. We found no differences in A<sub>2A</sub>R expression, 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate abundance, or protein kinase A type 1 activity between HNSCC and HD CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We instead detected a decrease in KCa3.1 channel activity, but not expression, in HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Activation of KCa3.1 channels by 1-EBIO restored the ability of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to chemotax in the presence of adenosine. Our data highlight the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to adenosine and the potential therapeutic benefit of KCa3.1 channel activators, which could increase infiltration of these T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into tumors.</p>

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss
<p>Pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was transiently increased in abundance during the first trimester of pregnancy, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent mi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scar</span></strong>riage (RM) patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced and the immunosuppressive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was impaired. Compared to Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from donors with normal pregnancies, RM patient Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exhibited changes in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting accessible chromatin reader proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, but not Tim-3<sup>−</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–deficient mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3–Gal-9 signaling–mediated immunoregulation by pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in maternal-fetal immune tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 abundance on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is a potential biomarker for RM diagnosis.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing of tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> contact or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> killing by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 tumors alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and antitumor T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the tumor microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intratumoral T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular bodies, starting from a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> zygote, often requires the movement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s across considerable distances, which is achieved through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s travel across diverse terrains, which dictates the character of navigation (<i>1</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s metastasize and migrate into healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, and knowledge of their migration strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some migratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others migrate in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration has been considered a sum of migratory and signaling activities of individually participating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the rear of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> group to coordinate, orient, and propel the entire group. This mechanism of collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration could be applicable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental migration.</p>

Distinct Regulatory Effects of Myeloid Cell and Endothelial Cell NAPDH Oxidase 2 on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertension caused by increased renin-angiotensin system activation is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production. Previous studies implicate NADPH oxidase (Nox) proteins as important reactive oxygen species sources during renin-angiotensin system activation, with different Nox isoforms being potentially involved. Among these, Nox2 is expressed in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types, including endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s, immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and microglia.

Both Tie2-CreNox2 knockout (KO) mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in both endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s) and LysM CreNox2KO mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s) had significantly lower BP than littermate controls, whereas basal BP was unaltered in Cdh5-CreERT2 Nox2KO mice (in which Nox2 is deficient only in endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s). The lower BP was attributable to an increased NO bioavailability that dynamically dilated resistance vessels in vivo under basal conditions without a change in renal function. Myeloid-specific Nox2 deletion had no effect on angiotensin II–induced hypertension, which, however, was blunted in Tie2-CreNox2KO mice, along with preservation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong>-dependent relaxation during angiotensin II stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identify a hitherto unrecognized modulation of basal BP by myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> Nox2, whereas endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> Nox2 regulates angiotensin II–induced hypertension.

Cell type transcriptome atlas for the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of land plants, some specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls contain additional lignin, compared with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls, thus providing mechanical strength and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate wall thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s undergoing secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included retarded early elongation of the inflorescence stem, shorter fibers, slower root growth, and shorter flower filaments. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening in fiber and vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation and inhibited secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening during growth and development.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y concerns the specification and functional differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls that both adhere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and contribute to the form and function of developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been identified as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls including those of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Garlic bulb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is detected only in companion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem sieve element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls.</p>

Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cortex influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape by patterning the deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall materials. The elongated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array architecture in light-grown epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s with explicit reference to array pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying array architecture, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> face, pointing to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-directed, rather than self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>izing, mechanism for specifying the major array pattern classes in the hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are examples of this. Border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (in some species known as border-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall components. Using this integrated glyco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y approach, we identified multiple novel modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s, leukocytes, and endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ed neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional programs uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to adulthood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene program. Furthermore, adult leukocytes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative network following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infarct</span></strong>ion, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration.

Cadherin-11–mediated adhesion of macrophages to myofibroblasts establishes a profibrotic niche of active TGF-β
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es contribute to the activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s, which secrete collagen and contract the collagen matrix to acutely repair injured tissue. Persistent myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> activation leads to the accumulation of fibrotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scar</span></strong> tissue that impairs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> function. We investigated the key processes that turn acute beneficial repair into destructive progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. We showed that homotypic cadherin-11 interactions promoted the specific binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es to and persistent activation of profibrotic myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s. Cadherin-11 was highly abundant at contacts between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es and myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s in mouse and human fibrotic lung tissues. In attachment assays, cadherin-11 junctions mediated specific recognition and strong adhesion between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es and myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s. One functional outcome of cadherin-11–mediated adhesion was locally restricted activation of latent transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e-myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> pairs that was not observed in cocultures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es and myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s that were not in contact with one another. Our data suggest that cadherin-11 junctions maintain latent TGF-β–producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es and TGF-β–activating myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s in close proximity to one another. Inhibition of homotypic cadherin-11 interactions could be used to cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e-myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> separation, thereby destabilizing the profibrotic niche.</p>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> spreading and contraction responses during B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation. We combined traction force microscopy and live-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force generation in these responses. We showed that B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction force when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction force generation and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction forces. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction force and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction forces than did mature naive B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing IgM-BCRs during B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation. Last, we observed that primary B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction forces than did B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force during B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation.</p>

The p85 isoform of the kinase S6K1 functions as a secreted oncoprotein to facilitate cell migration and tumor growth
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s can remodel surrounding microenvironments to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> growth, invasion, and migration by secreting proteins that educate surrounding stromal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We report that p85<sup>S6K1</sup>, the longest isoform of S6K (ribosomal protein S6 kinase), but not the shorter isoform p70<sup>S6K1</sup> or p56<sup>S6K2</sup>, was secreted from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s through its HIV TAT-like, N-terminal six-arginine motif.

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent demethylation of phosphatase PP2Ac promotes glucose deprivation–induced cell death independently of inhibiting glycolysis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s increase glucose metabolism to support aerobic glycolysis. However, only some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are acutely sensitive to glucose withdrawal, and the underlying mechanism of this selective sensitivity is unclear. We showed that glucose deprivation initiates a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that is dependent on the kinase RIPK1. Glucose withdrawal triggered rapid plasma membrane depolarization and an influx of extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular calcium into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> through the L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (CACNA1D), followed by activation of the kinase CAMK1. CAMK1 and the demethylase PPME1 were required for the subsequent demethylation and inactivation of the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase PP2A (PP2Ac) and the phosphorylation of RIPK1. Plasma membrane depolarization, PP2Ac demethylation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death were prevented by glucose and, unexpectedly, by its nonmetabolizable analog 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor. These findings reveal a previously unknown function of glucose as a signaling molecule that protects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from death induced by plasma membrane depolarization, independently of its role in glycolysis. Components of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death pathway represent potential therapeutic targets against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> reporters for 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Programming self-organizing multicellular structures with synthetic cell-cell signaling
<p>A common theme in the self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular tissues is the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> signaling networks to induce morphological changes. We used the modular synNotch juxtacrine signaling platform to engineer artificial genetic programs in which specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> contacts induced changes in cadherin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion. Despite their simplicity, these minimal inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular programs were sufficient to yield assemblies with hallmarks of natural developmental systems: robust self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization into multidomain structures, well-choreographed sequential assembly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type divergence, symmetry breaking, and the capacity for regeneration upon injury. The ability of these networks to drive complex structure formation illustrates the power of interlinking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> signaling with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> sorting: Signal-induced spatial re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization alters the local signals received by each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>, resulting in iterative cycles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate branching.

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Molecular Relationships Among Individual Plant Cells
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used extensively to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific gene expression in animals, but it has not been widely applied to plants. Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics platform for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We find that all major tissues and developmental stages are represented in this single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptome population. Further, distinct subpopulations and rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types, including putative quiescent center <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, were identified. A focused analysis of root epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes defined developmental trajectories for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> differentiation.

Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> resolution.</p>

Olfactomedin-1 activity identifies a cell invasion checkpoint during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the chick embryonic heart
<p>Endothelia in the atrioventricular (AV) canal of the developing heart undergo a prototypical epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to begin heart valve formation. Using an <i>in vitro</i> invasion assay, an extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix protein, Olfactomedin-1 (OLFM1), was found to increase mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> numbers in AV canals from embryonic chick hearts. Treatment with both anti-OLFM1 antibody and siRNA targeting OLFM1 inhibits mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> formation. OLFM1 does not alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> proliferation, migration or apoptosis. Dispersion, but lack of invasion in the presence of inhibiting antibody, identifies a specific role for OLFM1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion during EMT. This role is conserved in other epithelia, as OLFM1 similarly enhances invasion by MDCK epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in a transwell assay. Synergy is observed when TGFβ2 and OLFM1 are added to MDCK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cultures, indicating that OLFM-1 activity is cooperative with TGFβ. Inhibition of both OLFM1 and TGFβ in heart invasion assays shows a similar cooperative role during development. To explore OLFM1 activity during EMT, representative EMT markers were examined. Effects of OLFM1 protein and anti-OLFM1 on transcripts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecules and the transcription factors <i>Snail-1, Snail-2, Twist1</i> and <i>Sox-9</i> argue that OLFM1 does not initiate EMT. Rather, regulation of transcripts of <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i>, secreted proteases and mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> markers by both OLFM1 and anti-OLFM1 is consistent with regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion step of EMT. We conclude that OLFM1 is present and necessary during EMT in the embryonic chick heart. Its role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion and mesenchymal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> gene regulation suggests an invasion checkpoint in EMT where OLFM1 acts to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion into the three-dimensional matrix.</p>

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histolog</span></strong>ical and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.

In 2 rat models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histolog</span></strong>y. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of intense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s.

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently.

We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated.

We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s present in the MV and to determine which valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2.

K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to increase the expression of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecule–1.

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was evaluated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further evaluated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix components, mediators of extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix remodeling, matri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s.</p></sec>

Pericarditis as a Marker of Occult Cancer and a Prognostic Factor for Cancer Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a serious complication of malignancy. Its significance as a first symptom of occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and as a prognostic factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survival is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time diagnosis of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis until November 30, 2013. We calculated risks and standardized incidence ratios of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients without pericarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> during follow-up. The overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. The <3-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2–13.7). The 3- to <12-month standardized incidence ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0–1.2). Three-month survival after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis was 80% and 86% among those with and without pericarditis, respectively, and the hazard ratio was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.8). One-year survival was 65% and 70%, respectively, corresponding to a 3- to <12-month hazard ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.5).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a marker of occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and augurs increased mortality after a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis.</p></sec>

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/polarization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e polarization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es, endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, skeletal muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e polarization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like polarization even under M1-like polarizing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e polarization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like polarization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Infarcted Myocardium-Primed Dendritic Cells Improve Remodeling and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction by Modulating the Regulatory T Cell and Macrophage Polarization

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion, thereby influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> density. In growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> size, actin polymerization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

Differential IL-2 expression defines developmental fates of follicular versus nonfollicular helper T cells
<p>In response to infection, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s differentiate into two subpopulations: T follicular helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which support B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> antibody production, and non-T<sub>FH</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which enhance innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> functions. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), the major cytokine produced by naive T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, plays an important role in the developmental divergence of these populations. However, the relationship between IL-2 production and fate determination remains unclear. Using reporter mice, we found that differential production of IL-2 by naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s defined precursors fated for different immune functions. IL-2 producers, which were fated to become T<sub>FH</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, delivered IL-2 to nonproducers destined to become non-T<sub>FH</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Because IL-2 production was limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s receiving the strongest T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor (TCR) signals, a direct link between TCR-signal strength, IL-2 production, and T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate determination has been established.</p>

Chronicling embryos, cell by cell, gene by gene
<p>One of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y's great mysteries is how a single fertilized egg gives rise to the multitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types, tissues, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s that fit together to make an adult body. Now, a combination of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> sequencing technologies and computational tools is providing the most detailed picture yet of this process. Researchers made multiple snapshots of gene activity in most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in developing zebrafish or frog embryos. They then assembled those data, taken at intervals of just minutes to hours, into coherent, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> histories of how those embryos take shape. The analyses led to some surprises, including that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type–specific gene activity profiles early on, and yet, later, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s ultimately stray from their developmental trajectories. Such studies could also provide a recipe book for stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> scientists and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tissue engin</span></strong>eers who want to make various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types.</p>

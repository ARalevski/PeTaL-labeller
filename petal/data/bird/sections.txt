Class II Cytochrome P450 Reductase Governs the Biosynthesis of Alkaloids
<p>Expansion of the biosynthesis of plant specialized metabolites notably results from the massive recruitment of cytochrome P450s that catalyze multiple types of conversion of biosynthetic intermediates. For catalysis, P450s require a two-electron transfer catalyzed by shared cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases (CPRs), making these auxiliary proteins an essential component of specialized metabolism. CPR isoforms usually group into two distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es with different proposed roles, namely involvement in primary and basal specialized metabolisms for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I and inducible specialized metabolism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> II. By studying the role of CPRs in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids, we provide compelling evidence of an operational specialization of CPR isoforms in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (Madagascar periwinkle). Global analyses of gene expression correlation combined with transcript localization in specific leaf tissues and gene-silencing experiments of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of CPR all point to the strict requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> II CPRs for monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis with a minimal or null role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I. Direct assays of interaction and reduction of P450s in vitro, however, showed that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of CPR performed equally well. Such high specialization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> II CPRs in planta highlights the evolutionary strategy that ensures an efficient reduction of P450s in specialized metabolism.</p>

Management of Ventricular Tachycardia in the Setting of a Dedicated Unit for the Treatment of Complex Ventricular Arrhythmias
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>We investigated the impact of catheter ablation on ventricular tachycardia (VT) recurrence and survival in a large number of patients with structural heart disease treated in the setting of a dedicated multiskilled unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Since January 2007, we have implemented a multidisciplinary model, aiming for a comprehensive management of VT patients. Programmed ventricular stimulation was used to assess acute outcome. Primary end points were VT recurrence and the occurrence of cardiac and sudden cardiac death. Overall, 528 patients were treated by ablation (634 procedures; 1–4 procedures per patient). Among 482 tested with programmed ventricular stimulation after the last procedure, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> A result (noninducibility of any VT) was obtained in 371 patients (77%), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> B (inducibility of nondocumented VT) in 12.4%, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> C (inducibility of index VT) in 10.6%. After a median follow-up time of 26 months, VT recurred in 164 (34.1%) of 472 patients. VT recurrence was documented in 28.6% of patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> A result versus 39.6% of patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> B and 66.7% with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> C result (log-rank <i>P</i><0.001).

On the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration in Cyanobacteria
<p>The origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria led to the rise of oxygen on Earth ~2.3 billion years ago, profoundly altering the course of evolution by facilitating the development of aerobic respiration and complex multicellular life. Here we report the genomes of 41 uncultured organisms related to the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> <i>Oxyphotobacteria</i>), including members of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> <i>Melainabacteria</i> and a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> of Cyanobacteria (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> <i>Sericytochromatia</i>) that is basal to the <i>Melainabacteria</i> and <i>Oxyphotobacteria</i>. All members of the <i>Melainabacteria</i> and <i>Sericytochromatia</i> lack photosynthetic machinery, indicating that phototrophy was not an ancestral feature of the Cyanobacteria and that <i>Oxyphotobacteria</i> acquired the genes for photosynthesis relatively late in cyanobacterial evolution. We show that all three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es independently acquired aerobic respiratory complexes, supporting the hypothesis that aerobic respiration evolved after oxygenic photosynthesis.</p>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p>Root hairs are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The Root Hair Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in root hairs and has a conserved role in root hair development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In root hairs, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in root hair formation, based on observations of a short root hair phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of root hairs. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice Root Hairless1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of root hair development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the root hairs were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of root hair development in rice.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>ze sites into a relatively small number of site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es. Forcing each site to belong to one of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

Structural basis of bacterial transcription activation
<p>In bacteria, the activation of gene transcription at many promoters is simple and only involves a single activator. The cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate receptor protein (CAP), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>ic activator, is able to activate transcription independently through two different mechanisms. Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I mechanism requires an intact transcription activation complex (TAC) structure at a high resolution. Here we report a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of an intact <i>Escherichia coli</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I TAC containing a CAP dimer, a σ<sup>70</sup>–RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme, a complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I CAP-dependent promoter DNA, and a de novo synthesized RNA oligonucleotide. The structure shows how CAP wraps the upstream DNA and how the interactions recruit RNAP.

Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The structure of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the structure of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril structure, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient structural integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril structure, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril structure, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in plants. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I HDAC (HDA19) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> plants exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> plants, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I HDACs allow the rescue of plants from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>. Our results demonstrate that CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> specificity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and animals, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and correlated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not animals. The correlation of sequence and structural data suggests the single-headed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>-8 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Priming HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody precursors in human Ig loci transgenic mice
<p>A major obstacle to a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb)–based HIV vaccine is the activation of appropriate B cell precursors.

We tested the ability of the VRC01-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> bnAb germline-targeting immunogen eOD-GT8 60mer (60-subunit self-assembling nanoparticle) to activate appropriate precursors in mice transgenic for human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci. Despite an average frequency of, at most, about one VRC01-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> precursor per mouse, we found that at least 29% of singly immunized mice produced a VRC01-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> memory response, suggesting that priming generally succeeded when at least one precursor was present.

A Comprehensive Expression Profile of MicroRNAs and Other Classes of Non-Coding Small RNAs in Barley Under Phosphorous-Deficient and -Sufficient Conditions
<p>Phosphorus (P) is essential for plant growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in phosphate homeostasis. However, little is known about P effect on miRNA expression in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). In this study, we used Illumina's next-generation sequencing technology to sequence small RNAs (sRNAs) in barley grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. We identified 221 conserved miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs, of which 55 were only present in P-deficient treatment while 32 only existed in P-sufficient treatment. Total 47 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments (|log<sub>2</sub>| > 1). We also identified many other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of sRNAs, including sense and antisense sRNAs, repeat-associated sRNAs, transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs and chloroplast-derived sRNAs, and some of which were also significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments. Of all the sRNAs identified, antisense sRNAs were the most abundant sRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> in both P treatments. Surprisingly, about one-fourth of sRNAs were derived from the chloroplast genome, and a chloroplast-encoded tRNA-derived sRNA was the most abundant sRNA of all the sRNAs sequenced. Our data provide valuable clues for understanding the properties of sRNAs and new insights into the potential roles of miRNAs and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of sRNAs in the control of phosphate homeostasis.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years).

Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase.

This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>ic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

Lower Risk of Heart Failure and Death in Patients Initiated on Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors Versus Other Glucose-Lowering Drugs
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reduction in cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) was recently reported with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We compared HHF and death in patients newly initiated on any SGLT-2i versus other glucose-lowering drugs in 6 countries to determine if these benefits are seen in real-world practice and across SGLT-2i <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were collected via medical claims, primary care/hospital records, and national registries from the United States, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

CCR5 adopts three homodimeric conformations that control cell surface delivery
<p>Biophysical methods and x-ray crystallography have revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> A G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) can form homodimers. We combined computational approaches with receptor cross-linking, energy transfer, and a newly developed functional export assay to characterize the residues involved in the dimerization interfaces of the chemokine receptor CCR5, the major co-receptor for HIV-1 entry into cells. We provide evidence of three distinct CCR5 dimeric organizations, involving residues of transmembrane helix 5. Two dimeric states corresponded to unliganded receptors, whereas the binding of the inverse agonist maraviroc stabilized a third state. We found that CCR5 dimerization was required for targeting the receptor to the plasma membrane. These data suggest that dimerization contributes to the conformational diversity of inactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> A GPCRs and may provide new opportunities to investigate the cellular entry of HIV-1 and mechanisms for its inhibition.</p>

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT inhibitor is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this first-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> WNT inhibitor in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity compared to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of WNT inhibitors. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven tumors.</p>

A disease-linked <i>ULBP6</i> polymorphism inhibits NKG2D-mediated target cell killing by enhancing the stability of NKG2D ligand binding
<p>NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) is an activating receptor found on the surface of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, which regulates innate and adaptive immunity through recognition of the stress-induced ligands ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) to ULBP6 and MICA/B. Similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), these NKG2D ligands have a major histocompatibility complex–like fold and exhibit pronounced polymorphism, which influences human disease susceptibility. However, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I HLA polymorphisms occur predominantly in the α1α2 groove and affect antigen binding, the effects of most NKG2D ligand polymorphisms are unclear. We studied the molecular and functional consequences of the two major alleles of <i>ULBP6</i>, the most polymorphic <i>ULBP</i> gene, which are associated with autoimmunity and relapse after stem cell transplantation. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallography studies revealed that the arginine-to-leucine polymorphism within ULBP0602 affected the NKG2D-ULBP6 interaction by generating an energetic hotspot. This resulted in an NKG2D-ULBP0602 affinity of 15.5 nM, which is 10- to 1000-fold greater than the affinities of other ULBP-NKG2D interactions and limited NKG2D-mediated activation. In addition, soluble ULBP0602 exhibited high-affinity competitive binding for NKG2D and partially suppressed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells by other NKG2D ligands. These effects resulted in a decrease in a range of NKG2D-mediated effector functions. Our results reveal that <i>ULBP</i> polymorphisms affect the strength of human lymphocyte responses to cellular stress signals and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p>

Distinct molecular programs regulate synapse specificity in cortical inhibitory circuits
<p>How neuronal connections are established and organized into functional networks determines brain function. In the mammalian cerebral cortex, different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of GABAergic interneurons exhibit specific connectivity patterns that underlie their ability to shape temporal dynamics and information processing. Much progress has been made toward parsing interneuron diversity, yet the molecular mechanisms by which interneuron-specific connectivity motifs emerge remain unclear. In this study, we investigated transcriptional dynamics in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es of interneurons during the formation of cortical inhibitory circuits in mouse. We found that whether interneurons form synapses on the dendrites, soma, or axon initial segment of pyramidal cells is determined by synaptic molecules that are expressed in a subtype-specific manner. Thus, cell-specific molecular programs that unfold during early postnatal development underlie the connectivity patterns of cortical interneurons.</p>

Genome-wide de novo risk score implicates promoter variation in autism spectrum disorder
<p>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the first genome-wide evaluations of the contribution of de novo noncoding mutations to complex disorders. Using WGS, we identified 255,106 de novo mutations among sample genomes from members of 1902 quartet families in which one child, but not a sibling or their parents, was affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In contrast to coding mutations, no noncoding functional annotation category, analyzed in isolation, was significantly associated with ASD. Casting noncoding variation in the context of a de novo risk score across multiple annotation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es, however, did demonstrate association with mutations localized to promoter regions. We found that the strongest driver of this promoter signal emanates from evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites distal to the transcription start site. These data suggest that de novo mutations in promoter regions, characterized by evolutionary and functional signatures, contribute to ASD.</p>

Modular radical cross-coupling with sulfones enables access to sp<sup>3</sup>-rich (fluoro)alkylated scaffolds

This method’s tolerance of fluoroalkyl substituents proved particularly advantageous for the streamlined preparation of pharmaceutically oriented fluorinated scaffolds that previously required multiple steps, toxic reagents, and nonmodular retrosynthetic blueprints. Five specific sulfone reagents facilitate the rapid assembly of a vast set of compounds, many of which contain challenging fluorination patterns.</p>

Complexity in targeting membrane proteins
<p>For a cell, making hydrophobic integral membrane proteins (IMPs, or transmembrane proteins) is a complicated, but critical, process. All proteins are made by ribosomes in the cytosol, but IMPs, which account for ∼30% of the proteins encoded in the eukaryotic genome, must also be properly delivered to and inserted into their respective subcellular membranes, a process known as targeting. This is important because hydrophobic IMPs are rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm to prevent aggregation, which can lead to broad disruptions in cellular homeostasis. Because of the number and diversity of IMPs, identifying and targeting them relies on pathways that often overlap in function. The information for targeting, typically stored in hydrophobic α-helical transmembrane domain (TMD) signals in the IMPs, is recognized by factors that then ferry the IMP client to the destined lipid bilayer. On page 470 of this issue, Guna <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) demonstrate that, for an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> of IMPs, the current picture is incomplete. They identify a new targeting pathway for these IMPs, contributing to the elucidation of how the cell synthesizes this important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> of proteins.</p>

mTORC1 activity repression by late endosomal phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate
<p>Nutrient sensing by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) on lysosomes and late endosomes (LyLEs) regulates cell growth.

Growth factor deprivation induced the association of PI3KC2β with the Raptor subunit of mTORC1. Local PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis triggered repression of mTORC1 activity through association of Raptor with inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins. These results unravel an unexpected function for local PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> production in shutting off mTORC1.</p>

Neural circuitry gets rewired
<p>Our body organs are well integrated into a control framework that is represented by coordinated neural and hormonal signals.

On page 893 of this issue, Espinosa-Medina <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) clearly demonstrate that, contrary to current dogma, certain autonomic neural circuitry does not belong in the parasympathetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subdivis</span></strong>ion.

Proliferation of Regulatory DNA Elements Derived from Transposable Elements in the Maize Genome
<p>Genomic regions free of nucleosomes, which are hypersensitive to DNase I digestion, are known as DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and frequently contain cis-regulatory DNA elements. To investigate their prevalence and characteristics in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we developed high-resolution genome-wide DHS maps using a modified DNase-seq technique. Maize DHSs exhibit depletion of nucleosomes and low levels of DNA methylation and are enriched with conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs). We developed a protoplast-based transient transformation assay to assess the potential gene expression enhancer and/or promoter functions associated with DHSs, which showed that more than 80% of DHSs overlapping with CNSs showed an enhancer function. Strikingly, nearly 25% of maize DHSs were derived from transposable elements (TEs), including both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> I and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> II transposons. Interestingly, TE-derived DHSs (teDHSs) homologous to retrotransposons were enriched with sequences related to the intrinsic cis-regulatory elements within the long terminal repeats of retrotransposons. We demonstrate that more than 80% of teDHSs can drive transcription of a reporter gene in protoplast assays. These results reveal the widespread occurrence of TE-derived cis-regulatory sequences and suggest that teDHSs play a major role in transcriptional regulation in maize.</p>

Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

Regulatory Phosphorylation of Bacterial-Type PEP Carboxylase by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase RcCDPK1 in Developing Castor Oil Seeds
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. In developing castor oil seeds (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) a novel, allosterically desensitized 910-kD Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex, arises from a tight interaction between 107-kD plant-type PEPC and 118-kD bacterial-type (BTPC) subunits. The native Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) responsible for in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation of Class-2 PEPC’s BTPC subunit’s at Ser-451 was highly purified from COS and identified as RcCDPK1 (XP_002526815) by mass spectrometry. Heterologously expressed RcCDPK1 catalyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, inhibitory phosphorylation of BTPC at Ser-451 while exhibiting: (<i>i</i>) a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites with identical dissociation constants of 5.03 μM, (<i>ii</i>) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift, and (<i>iii</i>) a marked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent hydrophobicity. Pull-down experiments established the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of N-terminal GST-tagged RcCDPK1 with BTPC. RcCDPK1-Cherry localized to the cytosol and nucleus of tobacco bright yellow-2 cells, but colocalized with mitochondrial-surface associated BTPC-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein when both fusion proteins were coexpressed. Deletion analyses demonstrated that although its N-terminal variable domain plays an essential role in optimizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RcCDPK1 autophosphorylation and BTPC transphosphorylation activity, it is not critical for in vitro or in vivo target recognition. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPK4 and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) CDPKβ are RcCDPK1 orthologs that effectively phosphorylated castor BTPC at Ser-451.

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Total hip arthroplasty using a monobloc cementless femoral stem for patients with childhood Perthes’ disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Modular or custom-made femoral components have been preferred   for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with a history of Perthes’   disease because of the distortion in the anatomy of the proximal   femur.

Supracondylar osteotomy for the treatment of cubitus varus in children
<p>Cubitus varus is the most frequent complication   following the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children.   We investigated data from publications reporting on the surgical   management of cubitus varus found in electronic searches of Ovid/MEDLINE   and Cochrane Library databases. In 894 children from 40 included   studies, the mean age at initial injury was 5.7 years (3 to 8.6)   and 9.8 years (4 to 15.7) at the time of secondary correction. The four   osteotomy techniques were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>ified as lateral closing wedge, dome,   complex (multiplanar) and distraction osteogenesis. A mean angular   correction of 27.6º (18.5° to 37.0°) was achieved across all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es   of osteotomy. The meta-analytical summary estimate for overall rate   of good to excellent results was 87.8% (95% CI 84.4 to 91.2). No technique   was shown to significantly affect the surgical outcome, and the   risk of complications across all osteotomy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es was 14.5% (95%   CI 10.6 to 18.5). Nerve palsies occurred in 2.53% of cases (95%   CI 1.4 to 3.6), although 78.4% were transient.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism risk) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we calculated risks based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute risk of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The risk ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke risk. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a risk modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc risk component modifies and accentuates stroke risk in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke risk factors.</p></sec>

Transcatheter Interatrial Shunt Device for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (REDUCE LAP-HF I [Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In nonrandomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), fewer symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF) and midrange or preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥40%). We conducted the first randomized sham-controlled trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF ≥40%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REDUCE LAP-HF I (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure) was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial in patients with New York Heart Association <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> III or ambulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> IV HF, EF ≥40%, exercise PCWP ≥25 mm Hg, and PCWP-right atrial pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month. PCWP during exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects repeated measures model analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and control (n=22) groups. Mean age was 70±9 years, and 50% were female. At 1 month, the IASD resulted in a greater reduction in PCWP compared with sham control (<i>P</i>=0.028 accounting for all stages of exercise). Peak PCWP decreased by 3.5±6.4 mm Hg in the treatment group versus 0.5±5.0 mm Hg in the control group (<i>P</i>=0.14). There were no peri-procedural or 1-month major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events in the IASD group and 1 event (worsening renal function) in the control group (<i>P</i>=1.0).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with HF and EF ≥40%, IASD treatment reduces PCWP during exercise. Whether this mechanistic effect will translate into sustained improvements in symptoms and outcomes requires further evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the integration of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and integrated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CFR was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial scar and ischemia, rate-pressure product, type of radiotracer or stress agent used, and revascularization after scan (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–2.31; <i>P</i><0.001 per unit decrease in CFR after adjustment for maximal MBF and clinical covariates; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84–1.27; <i>P</i>=0.8 per unit decrease in maximal MBF after adjustment for CFR and clinical covariates). In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but preserved maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular mortality of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year. These patients were predominantly women (70%). Patients with preserved CFR but impaired maximal MBF had low cardiovascular mortality of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly preserved CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular mortality of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year. In multivariable analysis, the cardiovascular mortality risk gradient across the 4 concordant or discordant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es was independently driven by impaired CFR irrespective of impairment in maximal MBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CFR is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF.

Potential Cardiovascular and Total Mortality Benefits of Air Pollution Control in Urban China

We projected life-years gained if urban China were to reach 1 of 3 air quality goals: Beijing Olympic Games level (mean PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 55 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), China Class II standard (35 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), or World Health Organization standard (10 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). We compared projected air pollution reduction control benefits with potential benefits of reaching World Health Organization hypertension and tobacco control goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction to Beijing Olympic levels by 2030 would gain ≈241,000 (95% uncertainty interval, 189 000–293 000) life-years annually. Achieving either the China Class II or World Health Organization PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard would yield greater health benefits (992 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 790 000–1 180 000] or 1 827 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 1 481 00–2 129 000] annual life-years gained, respectively) than World Health Organization–recommended goals of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% reduction in smoking combined (928 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 830 000–1 033 000] life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Air quality improvement in different scenarios could lead to graded health benefits ranging from 241 000 life-years gained to much greater benefits equal to or greater than the combined benefits of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% smoking reduction.</p></sec>

Stellarex Drug-Coated Balloon for Treatment of Femoropopliteal Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are a predominant revascularization therapy for symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. Because of the differences in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and coating morphologies, varying clinical outcomes have been observed with different DCBs. We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-Coated Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-Coated Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified. The primary safety end point was met (92.1% for DCB versus 83.2% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.025 for superiority) and the primary patency rate was significantly higher with DCB (76.3% for DCB versus 57.6% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.003). Primary patency per Kaplan-Meier estimates at day 365 was 82.3% for DCB versus 70.9% for PTA (<i>P</i>=0.002). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB cohort (7.9% versus 16.8%, <i>P</i>=0.023). Improvements in ankle-brachial index, Rutherford <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>, and quality of life were comparable, but the PTA cohort required twice as many revascularizations.

In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection.

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to evaluate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to evaluate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>ified using the e-Frailty Index into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was evaluated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were evaluated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients.

Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance. A graded association was observed between higher baseline hs-cTnT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es and late gadolinium enhancement (≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The risk of incident HF was greater for higher hs-cTnT (≥8.81 ng/L versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% CI, 2.97–10.68).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with replacement fibrosis and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in CVD-free adults, findings that may precede HF symptoms by years. Minor elevations of hs-cTnT may represent a biochemical signature of early subclinical cardiac disease, providing an opportunity for targeted preventive interventions.</p></sec>

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es without considering hours of operation. Broad location <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">categori</span></strong>es may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity. This approach may help policy makers and funders to identify and prioritize potential partnerships for automated external defibrillator deployment in public-access defibrillator programs.</p></sec>

Conventional Versus Compression-Only Versus No-Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (chest compression and rescue breathing) has been recommended for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) because of the asphyxial nature of the majority of pediatric cardiac arrest events. However, the clinical effectiveness of additional rescue breathing (conventional CPR) compared with compression-only CPR in children is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This nationwide population-based study of pediatric OHCA patients was based on data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We included all pediatric patients who experienced OHCA in Japan from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a favorable neurological state 1 month after OHCA defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (corresponding to a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1–3). Outcomes were compared with logistic regression with uni- and multivariable modeling in the overall cohort and for a propensity-matched subset of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2157 patients were included; 417 received conventional CPR, 733 received compression-only CPR, and 1007 did not receive any bystander CPR. Among these patients, 213 (9.9%) survived with a favorable neurological status 1 month after OHCA, including 108/417 (25.9%) for conventional, 68/733 (9.3%) for compression-only, and 37/1007 (3.7%) for no-bystander CPR. In unadjusted analyses, conventional CPR was superior to compression-only CPR in neurologically favorable survival (odds ratio [OR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45–4.76; <i>P</i><0.0001), with a trend favoring conventional CPR that was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52, 95% CI 0.93–2.49), and with further attenuation of the difference in a propensity-matched subset (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81–1.77). Both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with higher odds for neurologically favorable survival compared with no-bystander CPR (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 5.01, 95% CI 2.98–8.57, and OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 3.29, 95% CI 1.93–5.71), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this population-based study of pediatric OHCA in Japan, both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with superior outcomes compared with no-bystander CPR. Unadjusted outcomes with conventional CPR were superior to compression-only CPR, with the magnitude of difference attenuated and no longer statistically significant after statistical adjustments. These findings support randomized clinical trials comparing conventional versus compression-only CPR in children, with conventional CPR preferred until such controlled comparative data are available, and either method preferred over no-bystander CPR.</p></sec>

Lipidomics Profiling and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Prospective Population-Based Bruneck Study
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The bulk of cardiovascular disease risk is not explained by traditional risk factors. Recent advances in mass spectrometry allow the identification and quantification of hundreds of lipid species. Molecular lipid profiling by mass spectrometry may improve cardiovascular risk prediction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Lipids were extracted from 685 plasma samples of the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (baseline evaluation in 2000). One hundred thirty-five lipid species from 8 different lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es were profiled by shotgun lipidomics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of cholesterol esters (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular disease over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events). Among the lipid species with the strongest predictive value were TAGs and CEs with a low carbon number and double-bond content, including TAG(54:2) and CE(16:1), as well as PE(36:5) (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−7</sup>, 2.2×10<sup>−4</sup>, and 2.5×10<sup>−3</sup>, respectively). Consideration of these 3 lipid species on top of traditional risk factors resulted in improved risk discrimination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>ification for cardiovascular disease (cross-validated ΔC index, 0.0210 [95% confidence interval, 0.0010-0.0422]; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.0212 [95% confidence interval, 0.0031-0.0406]; and continuous net re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>ification index, 0.398 [95% confidence interval, 0.175-0.619]). A similar shift in the plasma fatty acid composition was associated with cardiovascular disease in the UK Twin Registry (n=1453, 45 cases).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>This study applied mass spectrometry-based lipidomics profiling to population-based cohorts and identified molecular lipid signatures for cardiovascular disease. Molecular lipid species constitute promising new biomarkers that outperform the conventional biochemical measurements of lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong>es currently used in clinics.</p></sec>

Late Outcomes of Mitral Valve Repair for Mitral Regurgitation Due to Degenerative Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The pathological spectrum of degenerative diseases of the mitral valve (MV) that causes mitral regurgitation (MR) is broad, and there is limited information on late outcomes of MV repair in various subgroups of patients and pathologies. This study examines this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>All 840 patients who had MV repair for MR due to degenerative diseases from 1985 to 2004 were prospectively followed with clinical and echocardiographic evaluations at biennial intervals up to 26 years, median of 10.4 years. Clinical, hemodynamic, and pathological variables were evaluated for their association with outcomes. Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> were predictors of late cardiac- and valve-related deaths by multivariable analysis. MV repair failed to restore life span to normal in patients with functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">class</span></strong> IV. Thirty-eight patients had repeat MV surgery, and the probability of reoperation at 20 years was 5.9%. During the follow-up, recurrent severe MR developed in 37 patients, and moderate MR developed in 61. Age, isolated prolapse of the anterior leaflet, the degree of myxomatous changes in the MV, lack of mitral annuloplasty, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass were associated with increased risk of recurrent MR. At 20 years, the freedom from recurrent severe MR was 90.7%, and the freedom from moderate or severe MR was 69.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>MV repair for degenerative MR restored life span to normal except in patients with symptoms at rest and impaired left ventricular function. Advanced age and complex mitral valve pathologies increased the risk of late recurrent MR.</p></sec>

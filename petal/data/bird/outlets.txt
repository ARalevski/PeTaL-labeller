Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> approach less popular. However, the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the mean SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group (91% of mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; mean SST score 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>   group (mean ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group;   mean 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH, and 6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Red Light-Induced Phosphorylation of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in Stomatal Guard Cells
<p>Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing is stimulated by red and blue light. Blue light activates plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by phosphorylating its penultimate residue, threonine, via a blue light photoreceptor phototropin-mediated signaling pathway in guard cells. Blue light-activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase promotes the accumulation of osmolytes and, thus, the osmotic influx of water into guard cells, driving stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. Red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing is thought to be dependent on photosynthesis in both guard cell chloroplasts and mesophyll cells; however, how red light induces stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and whether PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is involved in this process have remained unclear. In this study, we established an immunohistochemical technique to detect the phosphorylation level of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and unexpectedly found that red light induces PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves. Red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves was correlated with stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing under red light and was inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid. In <i>aha1</i>-<i>9</i>, a knockout mutant of one of the major isoforms of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells, red light-dependent stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing was delayed in whole leaves. Furthermore, the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibited red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation as well as red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in whole leaves. Our results indicate that red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in guard cells promotes stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in whole leaves, providing insight into the photosynthetic regulation of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing.</p>

Distinct Functions of STARCH SYNTHASE 4 Domains in Starch Granule Formation
<p>The formation of normal starch granules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf chloroplasts requires STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4). In plants lacking SS4, chloroplasts typically produce only one round granule rather than multiple lenticular granules. The mechanisms by which SS4 de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>es granule number and morphology are not understood. The N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 is unique among SS isoforms and contains several long coiled-coil motifs, typically implicated in protein-protein interactions. The C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region contains the catalytic glucosyltransferase domains, which are widely conserved in plant SS and bacterial glycogen synthase (GS) isoforms. We investigated the specific roles of the N- and C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al regions of SS4 by expressing truncated versions of SS4 and a fusion between the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 and GS in the Arabidopsis <i>ss4</i> mutant. Expression of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 alone did not alter the <i>ss4</i> mutant phenotype. Expression of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 alone increased granule initiation but did not rescue their aberrant round morphology. Expression of a self-priming GS from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> also increased the number of round granules. Remarkably, fusion of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 to <i>A. tumefaciens</i> GS restored the development of wild-type-like lenticular starch granules. Interestingly, the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al region of SS4 alone or when fused to GS conferred a patchy subchloroplastic localization similar to that of the full-length SS4 protein. Considered together, these data suggest that, while the glucosyltransferase activity of SS4 is important for granule initiation, the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al part of SS4 serves to establish the correct granule morphology by properly localizing this activity.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Discharge on the day of surgery following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty within the United Kingdom NHS
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been successfully   performed in the United States healthcare system on outpatients.   Despite differences in healthcare structure and financial environment,   we hypothesised that it would be feasible to replicate this success   and perform UKA with safe day of surgery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e within the NHS,   in the United Kingdom. This has not been reported in any other United   Kingdom centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We report our experience of implementing a pathway to allow safe   day of surgery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e following UKA.

The most common reason for failure was logistical; five patients   had their operation too late in the day. Three patients failed to   mobilise safely, two had inadequate control of pain and one had   a leaking wound. The mean length of stay for those who were not   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed on the same day was 1.2 nights (1 to 3). During the same   time, 58 patients underwent planned inpatient UKA, as they were deemed   inappropriate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e on the day of surgery.

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the female pattern of the repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive system is established by default because the male repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive tracts (Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s) in the female degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that female mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both female and male repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive tracts. Retention of Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s was not caused by ectopic androgen pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s in female embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> maintenance.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s the excessive stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing under red light.</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>e the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome measure was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable functional outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as emergency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better survival and functional outcomes. Continued emphasis on public automated external defibrillator utilization programs may further improve outcomes of OHCA.</p></sec>

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized, clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical services–treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Primary exposure was duration of resuscitation in minutes (onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ation of resuscitation). Primary outcome was survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0–3).

The dynamic probability of an mRS score of 0 to 3 at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e declined over elapsed resuscitation duration, but subjects with initial shockable cardiac rhythm, witnessed cardiac arrest, and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation were more likely to survive with favorable outcome after prolonged efforts (30–40 minutes).

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>-state lifetime. The structure reveals two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the intracellular side and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the intro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair of the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-operatively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-operatively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ed   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-tear was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256).

These   findings were the same when analysed per-protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no evidence of difference in effectiveness between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>   and arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears. The rate of re-tear   is high in both groups, for all sizes of tear and ages and this   adversely affects the outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:107–15.</p></sec>

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide efforts affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been evaluated. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in disparate hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31 332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway document in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin testing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin testing in an accelerated diagnostic protocol. Implementation was monitored for >4 months and compared with usual care over the preceding 6 months. The main outcome measure was the odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e within 6 hours of presentation</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 11 529 participants in the preimplementation phase (range, 284–3465) and 19 803 in the postimplementation phase (range, 395–5039). Overall, the mean 6-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e rate increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%–37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%–43.8%). The odds of being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3–2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.4). For patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> rates (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96).

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that there is significant variation among US hospitals in terms of medication adherence after MI, and that patients treated at hospitals with higher medication adherence after MI will have better long-term cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 19 704 Medicare patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed after acute MI from 347 US hospitals participating in the ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ion Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines) from January 2, 2007, to October 1, 2010. Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e were 68% for β-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (57% to 69%). Compared with hospitals in the lowest quartile of 90-day composite medication adherence, hospitals with the highest adherence had lower unadjusted and adjusted 2-year major adverse cardiovascular e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> risk (27.5% versus 35.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.96). High-adherence hospitals also had lower adjusted rates of death or readmission (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.96), whereas there was no difference in mortality after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of secondary pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ion medications after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e varies significantly among US hospitals and is inversely associated with 2-year outcomes.

Treatment With Tissue Plasminogen Activator in the Golden Hour and the Shape of the 4.5-Hour Time-Benefit Curve in the National United States Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier tissue plasminogen activator treatment improves ischemic stroke outcome, but aspects of the time-benefit relationship still not well delineated are: (1) the degree of additional benefit accrued with treatment in the first 60 minutes after onset, and (2) the shape of the time-benefit curve through 4.5 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed patients who had acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours of onset from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke US national program.

Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow
<p>Mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>es neutrophil blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> in neutrophil retention and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>es persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to neutrophil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retention signal predominated, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15. Neutrophils in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous retention in the bone marrow. Our model thus demonstrates that mobilization in the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptation. Furthermore, our findings might help to find new modes of inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ion to treat conditions characterized by excessively low or high circulating neutrophils.</p>

Local protein synthesis is a ubiquitous feature of neuronal pre- and postsynaptic compartments
<p>There is ample evidence for localization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites; however, demonstrations of these processes in presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als are limited. We used expansion microscopy to resolve pre- and postsynaptic compartments in rodent neurons. Most presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als in the hippocampus and forebrain contained mRNA and ribosomes. We sorted fluorescently labeled mouse brain synaptosomes and then sequenced hundreds of mRNA species present within excitatory boutons. After brief metabolic labeling, >30% of all presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als exhibited a signal, providing evidence for ongoing protein synthesis. We tested different classic plasticity paradigms and observed distinct patterns of rapid pre- and/or postsynaptic translation. Thus, presynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>als are translationally competent, and local protein synthesis is differentially recruited to drive compartment-specific phenotypes that underlie different forms of plasticity.</p>

Flagellar microtubule doublet assembly in vitro reveals a regulatory role of tubulin C-terminal tails
<p>Microtubule doublets (MTDs), consisting of an incomplete B-microtubule at the surface of a complete A-microtubule, provide a structural scaffold mediating intraflagellar transport and ciliary beating. Despite the fundamental role of MTDs, the molecular mechanism governing their formation is unknown. We used a cell-free assay to demonstrate a crucial inhibitory role of the carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al (C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al) tail of tubulin in MTD assembly. Removal of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tail of an assembled A-microtubule allowed for the nucleation of a B-microtubule on its surface. C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al tails of only one A-microtubule protofilament inhibited this side-to-surface tubulin interaction, which would be overcome in vivo with binding protein partners. The dynamics of B-microtubule nucleation and its distinctive isotropic elongation was elucidated by using live imaging. Thus, inherent interaction properties of tubulin provide a structural basis driving flagellar MTD assembly.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single atoms cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective atom-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an atomic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance: Single atoms with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> atoms that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of atoms). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity. The correlation among single atoms was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of atoms by using a nanohole-array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled atom-field interactions.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al and C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">output</span></strong> for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">output</span></strong>. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">output</span></strong> in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">output</span></strong> than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

A murine <i>Zic3</i> transcript with a premature termination codon evades nonsense-mediated decay during axis formation
<p>The ZIC transcription factors are key mediators of embryonic development and <i>ZIC3</i> is the gene most commonly associated with <i>situs</i> defects (heterotaxy) in humans. Half of patient <i>ZIC3</i> mutations introduce a premature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ation codon (PTC). <i>In vivo</i>, PTC-containing transcripts might be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD efficiency is known to vary greatly between transcripts, tissues and individuals and it is possible that differences in survival of PTC-containing transcripts partially explain the striking phenotypic variability that characterizes ZIC3-associated congenital defects. For example, the PTC-containing transcripts might encode a C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ally truncated protein that retains partial function or that dominantly interferes with other ZIC family members. Here we describe the katun (<i>Ka</i>) mouse mutant, which harbours a mutation in the <i>Zic3</i> gene that results in a PTC. At the time of axis formation there is no discernible decrease in this PTC-containing transcript <i>in vivo</i>, indicating that the mammalian <i>Zic3</i> transcript is relatively insensitive to NMD, prompting the need to re-examine the molecular function of the truncated proteins predicted from human studies and to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>e whether the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al portion of ZIC3 possesses dominant-negative capabilities. A combination of <i>in vitro</i> studies and analysis of the <i>Ka</i> phenotype indicate that it is a null allele of <i>Zic3</i> and that the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al portion of ZIC3 does not encode a dominant-negative molecule. Heterotaxy in patients with PTC-containing <i>ZIC3</i> transcripts probably arises due to loss of ZIC3 function alone.</p>

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac abnormalities causing dependence on the arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a shunt usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and early mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater early stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS for cardiac conditions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred se<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>y-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted.

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> and close, and it has been assumed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA melting. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal motions control the promoter search and drive DNA melting in the absence of external energy sources.</p>

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric ion channels assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ed by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transitions from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> to a closed conformation. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in ion channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformation of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporation of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interactions, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and function, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow design of binding proteins with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular immune receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered immunity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding domain (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an amino-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al coiled-coil (CC) domain. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by interdomain interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC domain in regulating Rx1 activity or immune signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC domain in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC domain acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered immunity. Systematic disruption of the hydrophobic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease resistance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated resistance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated resistance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease resistance or cell death signaling.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frame after translation of the upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Variable Effects of C-Terminal Fusions on FLS2 Function: Not All Epitope Tags Are Created Equal
<p>Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are the largest family of proteins in plants and are responsible for perceiving the vast majority of extracellular stimuli. Thus, RLKs function in diverse processes, including sensing pathogen attacks, regulating symbiotic interactions, transducing hormone and peptide signals, and monitoring cell wall status. However, despite their fundamental role in plant biology, very few antibodies are available against RLKs, which necessitates the use of epitope tags and fluorescent protein fusions in biochemical analyses such as immunoblot analysis and intracellular visualization. Epitope tags are widely used and are typically assumed to be benign, with no influence on protein function. FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) is the receptor for bacterial flagellin and often is used as a model for RLK function. Previous work implies that carboxyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al epitope fusions to FLS2 maintain protein function. Here, a detailed complementation analysis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>fls2</i> mutant plants expressing various FLS2 C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al epitope fusions revealed highly variable and unpredictable FLS2-mediated signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">output</span></strong>s. In addition, only one out of four FLS2 epitope fusions maintained the ability to inhibit plant growth in response to flg22 treatment comparable to that in the wild type or control untagged transgenic lines. These results raise concerns over the widespread use of RLK epitope tag fusions for functional studies. Many of the subtleties of FLS2 function, and by extension those of other RLKs, may have been overlooked or inappropriately interpreted through the use of RLK epitope tag fusions.</p>

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>es as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen wall exine and develop into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>es. In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>IN<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>ATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e domains, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose wall to pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> formation of exine at these sites.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a folded segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ed under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric site revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil fragment. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation. Based on these results, a model is proposed illustrating the role of the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al domain of BnaDGAT1 as a positive and negative modulator of TAG biosynthesis.</p>

The Role of ENHANCED RESPONSES TO ABA1 (ERA1) in Arabidopsis Stomatal Responses Is Beyond ABA Signaling
<p>Proper stomatal responses are essential for plant function in an altered environment. The core signaling pathway for abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure involves perception of the hormone that leads to the activation of guard cell anion channels by the protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> STOMATA1. Several other regulators are suggested to modulate the ABA signaling pathway, including the protein ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA1 (ERA1), that encodes the farnesyl transferase β-subunit. The <i>era1</i> mutant is hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and shows a more closed stomata phenotype. Using a genetics approach with the double mutants <i>era1 abi1-1</i> and <i>era1 ost1</i>, we show that while <i>era1</i> suppressed the high stomatal con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ance of <i>abi1-1</i> and <i>ost1</i>, the ERA1 function was not required for stomatal closure in response to ABA and environmental factors. Further experiments indicated a role for ERA1 in blue light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. In addition, we show that ERA1 function in disease resistance was independent of its role in stomatal regulation. Our results indicate a function for ERA1 in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and pathogen immunity.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis resistance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted resistance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to resistance has not been de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ed. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal resistance. Interestingly, we found that N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the insertion of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>us. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al extension, which harbors the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lack the conserved phosphorylation site found in a C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al extension of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al extension for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In conjunction with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing valves reminiscent of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Active repression by RARγ signaling is required for vertebrate axial elongation
<p>Retinoic acid receptor gamma 2 (RARγ2) is the major RAR isoform expressed throughout the caudal axial progenitor domain in vertebrates. During a microarray screen to identify RAR targets, we identified a subset of genes that pattern caudal structures or promote axial elongation and are upregulated by increased RAR-mediated repression. Previous studies have suggested that RAR is present in the caudal domain, but is quiescent until its activation in late stage embryos <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ates axial elongation. By contrast, we show here that RARγ2 is engaged in all stages of axial elongation, not solely as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ator of axial growth. In the absence of RA, RARγ2 represses transcriptional activity <i>in vivo</i> and maintains the pool of caudal progenitor cells and presomitic mesoderm. In the presence of RA, RARγ2 serves as an activator, facilitating somite differentiation. Treatment with an RARγ-selective inverse agonist (NRX205099) or overexpression of dominant-negative RARγ increases the expression of posterior Hox genes and that of marker genes for presomitic mesoderm and the chordoneural hinge. Conversely, when RAR-mediated repression is reduced by overexpressing a dominant-negative co-repressor (c-SMRT), a constitutively active RAR (VP16-RARγ2), or by treatment with an RARγ-selective agonist (NRX204647), expression of caudal genes is diminished and extension of the body axis is prematurely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>ated. Hence, gene repression mediated by the unliganded RARγ2–co-repressor complex constitutes a novel mechanism to regulate and facilitate the correct expression levels and spatial restriction of key genes that maintain the caudal progenitor pool during axial elongation in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos.</p>

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies examining the association between hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and clinical outcomes have reported conflicting results. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with poor neurological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ilated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor neurological function at hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized linear r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion with a log link was used to test the association between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor neurological outcome. To assess whether there was an association between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor neurological outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> cut points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia. Poor neurological function at hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e occurred in 70% of patients in the entire cohort and in 77% versus 65% among patients with versus without exposure to hyperoxia respectively (absolute risk difference, 12%; 95% confidence interval, 1–23). Hyperoxia was independently associated with poor neurological function (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was associated with a 3% increase in risk of poor neurological outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05). We found that the association with poor neurological outcome began at ≥300 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Early hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with poor neurological function at hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)-Guided Therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">termin</span></strong>al probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ed a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion from admission to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e) versus con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed with an NT-proBNP re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not significantly improve the combined e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.37; <i>P</i>=0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ional patients, <i>P</i>=0.39).

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricular fibrillation/pulseless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e. Secondary outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e functional status and adverse drug-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse effects were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs. Together the findings may signal a clinical benefit that invites further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), mortality is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day mortality after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day mortality in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower mortality. Long-term mortality in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair. Mortality after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of mortality after elective AAA repair, but results of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair have improved as well. However, late mortality from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ion treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.</p></sec>

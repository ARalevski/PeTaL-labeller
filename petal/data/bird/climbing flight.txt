The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> behavior on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> treatment, followed by the induced-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group and then the voluntary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> groups. Metabolic rate during agitated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group. Early senescence in the induced-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> performance are reflexively activated during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> agility by easing the transition from stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape maneuvers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the robot’s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the yaw torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the maneuver. The robot enables new methods for studying animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> characteristics allow for real-world <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> missions.</p>

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight
<p>Nectar-feeding animals have among the highest recorded metabolic rates. High aerobic performance is linked to oxidative damage in muscles. Antioxidants in nectar are scarce to nonexistent. We propose that nectarivores use nectar sugar to mitigate the oxidative damage caused by the muscular demands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. We found that sugar-fed moths had lower oxidative damage to their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscle membranes than unfed moths. Using respirometry coupled with δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses, we showed that moths generate antioxidant potential by shunting nectar glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting in a reduction in oxidative damage to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscles. We suggest that nectar feeding, the use of PPP, and intense exercise are causally linked and have allowed the evolution of powerful fliers that feed on nectar.</p>

Avian egg shape: Form, function, and evolution
<p>Avian egg shape is generally explained as an adaptation to life history, yet we currently lack a global synthesis of how egg-shape differences arise and evolve. Here, we apply morphometric, mechanistic, and macroevolutionary analyses to the egg shapes of 1400 bird species. We characterize egg-shape diversity in terms of two biologically relevant variables, asymmetry and ellipticity, allowing us to quantify the observed morphologies in a two-dimensional morphospace. We then propose a simple mechanical model that explains the observed egg-shape diversity based on geometric and material properties of the egg membrane. Finally, using phylogenetic models, we show that egg shape correlates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> ability on broad taxonomic scales, suggesting that adaptations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> may have been critical drivers of egg-shape variation in birds.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ascent</span></strong> with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

A protocol and calibration method for accurate multi-camera field videography
<p>Stereo videography is a powerful technique for quantifying the kinematics and behavior of animals, but it can be challenging to use in an outdoor field setting. We here present a workflow and associated software for performing calibration of cameras placed in a field setting and estimating the accuracy of the resulting stereoscopic reconstructions. We demonstrate the workflow through example stereoscopic reconstructions of bat and bird <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. We provide software tools for planning experiments and processing the resulting calibrations that other researchers may use to calibrate their own cameras. Our field protocol can be deployed in a single afternoon, requiring only short video clips of light, portable calibration objects.</p>

Functional Metabolomics Characterizes a Key Role for <i>N</i>-Acetylneuraminic Acid in Coronary Artery Diseases
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>As new biomarkers of coronary artery diseases (CAD) emerge via metabolomics, the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Functional metabolomics aims to translate metabolomics-derived biomarkers to disease mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cohort of 2324 patients who underwent coronary angiography from 4 independent centers was studied. A combination of ultra–performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode was used for untargeted analysis of metabolites in plasma. Significant differential metabolites were identified by cross-comparisons with and within CAD types, including normal coronary artery, nonobstructvie coronary atherosclerosis, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. A tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry–based approach using isotope-labeled standard addition was subsequently performed for targeted analysis of the metabolic marker <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). A functional metabolomics strategy was proposed to investigate the role of Neu5Ac in the progression of CAD by using in vitro and in vivo models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a total of 36 differential metabolites, 35 of which were confirmed with reference compounds. Elevation of Neu5Ac was observed in plasma during CAD progression in center 1 (<i>P</i>=4.0e-64, n=2019) and replicated in 3 independent centers (n=305). The increased level of Neu5Ac in plasma was confirmed by accurate targeted quantification. Mechanistically, Neu5Ac was able to trigger myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase signaling pathway through binding to RhoA and Cdc42, but not Rac1. Silencing neuraminidase-1, the enzyme that regulates Neu5Ac generation, ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced injury in cardiomyocytes and ligation/isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia injury in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of neuraminidase by anti-influenza drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, also protected cardiomyocytes and the heart from myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Functional metabolomics identified a key role for Neu5Ac in acute myocardial infarction, and targeting neuraminidase-1 may represent an unrecognized therapeutic intervention for CAD.</p></sec>

Complement Receptor C5aR1 Plays an Evolutionarily Conserved Role in Successful Cardiac Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Defining conserved molecular pathways in animal models of successful cardiac regeneration could yield insight into why adult mammals have inadequate cardiac regeneration after injury. Insight into the transcriptomic landscape of early cardiac regeneration from model organisms will shed light on evolutionarily conserved pathways in successful cardiac regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here we describe a cross-species transcriptomic screen in 3 model organisms for cardiac regeneration: axolotl, neonatal mice, and zebrafish. Apical resection to remove ≈10% to 20% of ventricular mass was carried out in these model organisms. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on the hearts harvested at 3 time points: 12, 24, and 48 hours after resection. Sham surgery was used as internal control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Genes associated with inflammatory processes were found to be upregulated in a conserved manner. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> receptors (activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> components, part of the innate immune system) were found to be highly upregulated in all 3 species. This approach revealed induction of gene expression for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> 5a receptor 1 in the regenerating hearts of zebrafish, axolotls, and mice. Inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> 5a receptor 1 significantly attenuated the cardiomyocyte proliferative response to heart injury in all 3 species. Furthermore, after left ventricular apical resection, the cardiomyocyte proliferative response was diminished in mice with genetic deletion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> 5a receptor 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data reveal that activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> 5a receptor 1 mediates an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation after cardiac injury and identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> pathway activation as a common pathway of successful heart regeneration.</p></sec>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>s of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of female (XX) versus male (XY) sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically female mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Female low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, female mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Female <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from female XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX females. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> in phenotypic females profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex chromosomes regulate aortic vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs. Sex chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for sex-specific AAA therapeutics.</p></sec>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of the observed DEGs using established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Dimerization in LBD16 and LBD18 Transcription Factors Is Critical for Lateral Root Formation
<p>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKEs (hereafter referred to as LBD) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in a plethora of plant growth and development. The leucine (Leu) zipper-like coiled-coil motif in the lateral organ boundaries domain of the class I LBD proteins has been proposed to mediate protein dimerization, but it has not been experimentally assessed yet. LBD16 and LBD18 have been well characterized to play important roles in lateral root development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we investigated the role of the coiled-coil motif in the dimerization of LBD16 and LBD18 and in transcriptional regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. We built the molecular models of the coiled coil of LBD16 and LBD18, providing the probable Leu zipper models of the helix dimer. Using a variety of molecular techniques, such as bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation, luciferase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation imaging, GST pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the conserved Leu or valine residues in the coiled-coil motif are critical for the dimerization of LBD16 or LBD18. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress HA:LBD16 or HA:LBD16<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd16</i> or HA:LBD18 or HA:LBD18<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd18</i>, we demonstrated that the homodimerization of LBD18 mediated by the coiled-coil motif is crucial for transcriptional regulation via promoter binding and for lateral root formation. In addition, we found that the carboxyl-terminal region beyond the coiled-coil motif in LBD18 acts as an additional dimerization domain. These results provide a molecular basis for homodimerization and heterodimerization among the 42 Arabidopsis LBD family members for displaying their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions.</p>

Dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 is crucial for murine sperm maturation in vivo
<p>The posttranslational modification of histones is crucial in spermatogenesis, as in other tissues; however, during spermiogenesis, histones are replaced with protamines, which are critical for the tight packaging of the DNA in sperm cells. Protamines are also posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which prompted our investigation of the underlying mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical consequences of their regulation. On the basis of a screen that implicated the heat shock protein Hspa4l in spermatogenesis, we generated mice deficient in Hspa4l (<i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice), which showed male infertility and the malformation of sperm heads. These phenotypes are similar to those of <i>Ppp1cc</i>-deficient mice, and we found that the amount of a testis- and sperm-specific isoform of the Ppp1cc phosphatase (Ppp1cc2) in the chromatin-binding fraction was substantially less in <i>Hspa4l</i>-null spermatozoa than that in those of wild-type mice. We further showed that Ppp1cc2 was a substrate of the chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 and that Hspa4l enhanced the release of Ppp1cc2 from these complexes, enabling the freed Ppp1cc2 to localize to chromatin. Pull-down and in vitro phosphatase assays suggested the dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 (Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup>) by Ppp1cc2. To confirm the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical importance of Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup> dephosphorylation, we mutated Ser<sup>56</sup> to alanine in Prm2 (Prm2 S56A). Introduction of this mutation to <i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice (<i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup>; <i>Prm2</i><sup>S56A/S56A</sup>) restored the malformation of sperm heads and the infertility of <i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The dephosphorylation signal to eliminate phosphate was crucial, and these results unveiled the mechanism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical relevance of the dephosphorylation of Prm2 for sperm maturation in vivo.</p>

Bioinspired spring origami
<p>Origami enables folding of objects into a variety of shapes in arts, engineering, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. In contrast to well-known paper-folded objects, the wing of the earwig has an exquisite natural folding system that cannot be sufficiently described by current origami models. Such an unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system displays incompatible folding patterns, remains open by a bistable locking mechanism during flight, and self-folds rapidly without muscular actuation. We show that these notable functionalities arise from the protein-rich joints of the earwig wing, which work as extensional and rotational springs between facets. Inspired by this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical wing, we establish a spring origami model that broadens the folding design space of traditional origami and allows for the fabrication of precisely tunable, four-dimensional–printed objects with programmable bioinspired morphing functionalities.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The structure of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the structure of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril structure, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient structural integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril structure, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril structure, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

A draft genome of the brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i>, S-strain: a platform for future studies of ‘mozuku’ biology
<p>The brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> (Okinawa mozuku), is economically one of the most important edible seaweeds, and is cultivated for market primarily in Okinawa, Japan. <i>C. okamuranus</i> constitutes a significant source of fucoidan, which has various physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activities. To facilitate studies of seaweed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, we decoded the draft genome of <i>C. okamuranus</i> S-strain. The genome size of <i>C. okamuranus</i> was estimated as ∼140 Mbp, smaller than genomes of two other brown algae, <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i> and <i>Saccharina japonica</i>. Sequencing with ∼100× coverage yielded an assembly of 541 scaffolds with N50 = 416 kbp. Together with transcriptomic data, we estimated that the <i>C. okamuranus</i> genome contains 13,640 protein-coding genes, approximately 94% of which have been confirmed with corresponding mRNAs. Comparisons with the <i>E. siliculosus</i> genome identified a set of <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes that encode enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for sulfated fucans and alginate biosynthesis. In addition, we identified <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes for enzymes involved in phlorotannin biosynthesis. The present decoding of the <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> genome provides a platform for future studies of mozuku <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

<i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> HtpG Interaction with nsLTP AsE246 Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation
<p>Plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are involved in a number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes including root nodule symbiosis. However, the role of nsLTPs in legume-rhizobium symbiosis remains poorly understood, and no rhizobia proteins that interact with nsLTPs have been reported to date. In this study, we used a bacteria two-hybrid system and identified the high temperature protein G (HtpG) from <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> that interacts with the nsLTP AsE246. The interaction between HtpG and AsE246 was confirmed by far-Western blotting and bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation. Our results indicated that the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) domain of HtpG mediates the HtpG-AsE246 interaction. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HtpG was colocalized with AsE246 in infected nodule cells and symbiosome membranes. Expression of the <i>htpG</i> gene was relatively higher in young nodules and was highly expressed in the infection zones. Further investigation showed that <i>htpG</i> expression affects lipid abundance and profiles in root nodules and plays an essential role in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. Our findings provide further insights into the functional mechanisms behind the transport of symbiosome lipids via nsLTPs in root nodules.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Parts-Prospecting for a High-Efficiency Thiamin Thiazole Biosynthesis Pathway
<p>Plants synthesize the thiazole precursor of thiamin (cThz-P) via THIAMIN4 (THI4), a suicide enzyme that mediates one reaction cycle and must then be degraded and resynthesized. It has been estimated that this THI4 turnover consumes 2% to 12% of the maintenance energy budget and that installing an energy-efficient alternative pathway could substantially increase crop yield potential. Available data point to two natural alternatives to the suicidal THI4 pathway: (i) nonsuicidal prokaryotic THI4s that lack the active-site Cys residue on which suicide activity depends, and (ii) an uncharacterized thiazole synthesis pathway in flowers of the tropical arum lily <i>Caladium bicolor</i> that enables production and emission of large amounts of the cThz-P analog 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole (MVT). We used functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> Δ<i>thiG</i> strain to identify a nonsuicidal bacterial THI4 (from <i>Thermovibrio ammonificans</i>) that can function in conditions like those in plant cells. We explored whether <i>C. bicolor</i> synthesizes MVT de novo via a novel route, via a suicidal or a nonsuicidal THI4, or by catabolizing thiamin. Analysis of developmental changes in MVT emission, extractable MVT, thiamin level, and THI4 expression indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> flowers make MVT de novo via a massively expressed THI4 and that thiamin is not involved. Functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation tests indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4, which has the active-site Cys needed to operate suicidally, may be capable of suicidal and – in hypoxic conditions – nonsuicidal operation. <i>T. ammonificans</i> and <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4s are thus candidate parts for rational redesign or directed evolution of efficient, nonsuicidal THI4s for use in crop improvement.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) transporters to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian oscillator period are thought to adjust the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian oscillators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein interaction network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway interactions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring interactions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ary bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these interactions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their interactions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

METHIONINE ADENOSYLTRANSFERASE4 Mediates DNA and Histone Methylation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>DNA and histone methylation coregulate heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in animals and plants. To identify factors involved in maintaining gene silencing, we conducted a forward genetic screen for mutants that release the silenced transgene <i>Pro35S::NEOMYCIN PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE II</i> in the transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line <i>L119</i>. We identified <i>MAT4/SAMS3/MTO3/AT3G17390</i>, which encodes methionine (Met) adenosyltransferase 4 (MAT4)/<i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met synthetase 3 that catalyzes the synthesis of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met (SAM) in the one-carbon metabolism cycle. <i>mat4</i> mostly decreases CHG and CHH DNA methylation and histone H3K9me2 and reactivates certain silenced transposons. The exogenous addition of SAM partially rescues the epigenetic defects of <i>mat4</i>. SAM content and DNA methylation were reduced more in <i>mat4</i> than in three other <i>mat</i> mutants. <i>MAT4</i> knockout mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 were lethal, indicating that <i>MAT4</i> is an essential gene in Arabidopsis. MAT1, 2, and 4 proteins exhibited nearly equal activity in an in vitro assay, whereas MAT3 exhibited higher activity. The native <i>MAT4</i> promoter driving <i>MAT1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i> cDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed the <i>mat4</i> mutant. However, most <i>mat4</i> transgenic lines carrying native <i>MAT1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i> promoters driving <i>MAT4</i> cDNA did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> the <i>mat4</i> mutant because of their lower expression in seedlings. Genetic analyses indicated that the <i>mat1mat4</i> double mutant is dwarfed and the <i>mat2mat4</i> double mutant was nonviable, while <i>mat1mat2</i> showed normal growth and fertility. These results indicate that MAT4 plays a predominant role in SAM production, plant growth, and development. Our findings provide direct evidence of the cooperative actions between metabolism and epigenetic regulation.</p>

Variable Effects of C-Terminal Fusions on FLS2 Function: Not All Epitope Tags Are Created Equal
<p>Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are the largest family of proteins in plants and are responsible for perceiving the vast majority of extracellular stimuli. Thus, RLKs function in diverse processes, including sensing pathogen attacks, regulating symbiotic interactions, transducing hormone and peptide signals, and monitoring cell wall status. However, despite their fundamental role in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, very few antibodies are available against RLKs, which necessitates the use of epitope tags and fluorescent protein fusions in biochemical analyses such as immunoblot analysis and intracellular visualization. Epitope tags are widely used and are typically assumed to be benign, with no influence on protein function. FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) is the receptor for bacterial flagellin and often is used as a model for RLK function. Previous work implies that carboxyl-terminal epitope fusions to FLS2 maintain protein function. Here, a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation analysis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>fls2</i> mutant plants expressing various FLS2 C-terminal epitope fusions revealed highly variable and unpredictable FLS2-mediated signaling outputs. In addition, only one out of four FLS2 epitope fusions maintained the ability to inhibit plant growth in response to flg22 treatment comparable to that in the wild type or control untagged transgenic lines. These results raise concerns over the widespread use of RLK epitope tag fusions for functional studies. Many of the subtleties of FLS2 function, and by extension those of other RLKs, may have been overlooked or inappropriately interpreted through the use of RLK epitope tag fusions.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

The Glucose Sensor MdHXK1 Phosphorylates a Tonoplast Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger to Improve Salt Tolerance
<p>Glc regulates many vital processes, including plant growth, development, metabolism, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the molecular mechanism by which Glc acts as a signal to regulate salinity tolerance remains unclear. In this study, we found that the apple (<i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh.)

A combination of split ubiquitin system, pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation assays demonstrated that MdHXK1 interacts with and phosphorylates the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger MdNHX1 at its Ser-275 residue.

Furthermore, Ser-275 of MdNHX1 was found to be crucial for MdHXK1-mediated phosphorylation. Finally, a series of transgenic analyses demonstrated that salt tolerance mediated by MdHXK1 partially depended on MdNHX1. Overall, our findings provide insights into how sugar recruits and regulates MdNHX1 in response to high salinity in plants.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 protein levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify proteins that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) protein family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB proteins have diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that include acting as scaffolds for protein complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 protein levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated protein PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

The Cytokinin Oxidase/Dehydrogenase CKX1 Is a Membrane-Bound Protein Requiring Homooligomerization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum for Its Cellular Activity
<p>Degradation of the plant hormone cytokinin is controlled by cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) enzymes. The molecular and cellular behavior of these proteins is still largely unknown. In this study, we show that CKX1 is a type II single-pass membrane protein that localizes predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This indicates that this CKX isoform is a bona fide ER protein directly controlling the cytokinin, which triggers the signaling from the ER. By using various approaches, we demonstrate that CKX1 forms homodimers and homooligomers in vivo. The amino-terminal part of CKX1 was necessary and sufficient for the protein oligomerization as well as for targeting and retention in the ER. Moreover, we show that protein-protein interaction is largely facilitated by transmembrane helices and depends on a functional GxxxG-like interaction motif. Importantly, mutations rendering CKX1 monomeric interfere with its steady-state localization in the ER and cause a loss of the CKX1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activity by increasing its ER-associated degradation. Therefore, our study provides evidence that oligomerization is a crucial parameter regulating CKX1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activity and the cytokinin concentration in the ER. The work also lends strong support for the cytokinin signaling from the ER and for the functional relevance of the cytokinin pool in this compartment.</p>

OsbZIP48, a HY5 Transcription Factor Ortholog, Exerts Pleiotropic Effects in Light-Regulated Development
<p>Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signaling components to regulate their development. Among the light signaling components identified to date, HY5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, has been investigated extensively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), a dicot. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we identified three homologs of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 homolog) homologs are absent in the monocots analyzed. Out of the three homologs identified in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we have functionally characterized <i>OsbZIP48</i>. <i>OsbZIP48</i> was able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong> the <i>Athy5</i> mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in rice. Moreover, the OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark-grown rice and <i>Athy5</i> seedlings <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed with <i>OsbZIP48</i>, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison with <i>AtHY5</i>, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the overexpression of full-length <i>OsbZIP48</i> in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that <i>OsKO2</i>, which encodes <i>ent</i>-kaurene oxidase 2 of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>OE</sup></i> and up-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>KD</sup></i> transgenics as compared with the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 binds directly to the <i>OsKO2</i> promoter. The RNA interference lines and the T-DNA insertional mutant of <i>OsbZIP48</i> showed seedling-lethal phenotypes despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development in the T-DNA insertional mutant. These data provide credible evidence that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot system like rice in comparison with its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to drought and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and salt stress of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants.

The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

AtAIRP2 E3 Ligase Affects ABA and High-Salinity Responses by Stimulating Its ATP1/SDIRIP1 Substrate Turnover
<p>AtAIRP2 is a cytosolic RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates an abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Yeast two-hybrid screening using AtAIRP2 as bait identified ATP1 (AtAIRP2 Target Protein1) as a substrate of AtAIRP2. ATP1 was found to be identical to SDIRIP1, which was reported recently to be a negative factor in ABA signaling and a target protein of the RING E3 ligase SDIR1. Accordingly, ATP1 was renamed ATP1/SDIRIP1. A specific interaction between AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 and ubiquitination of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 were demonstrated in vitro and in planta. The turnover of ATP1/SDIRIP1 was regulated by AtAIRP2 in cell-free degradation and protoplast cotransfection assays. The ABA-mediated germination assay of <i>35S</i>:<i>ATP1/SDIRIP1-RNAi/atairp2</i> double mutant progeny revealed that ATP1/SDIRIP1 acts downstream of AtAIRP2. AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 reciprocally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed the ABA- and salt-insensitive germination phenotypes of <i>sdir1</i> and <i>atairp2</i> mutants, respectively, indicating their combinatory roles in seed germination. Subcellular localization and bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation experiments in the presence of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, showed that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 were colocalized to the cytosolic spherical body, which lies in close proximity to the nucleus, in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaf cells. The 26S proteasome subunits RPN12a and RPT1 and the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP101 were colocalized to these discrete punctae-like structures. These results raised the possibility that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 interact in the cytosolic spherical compartment. Collectively, our data suggest that the down-regulation of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 RING E3 ubiquitin ligases is critical for ABA and high-salinity responses during germination in Arabidopsis.</p>

Pipeline to Identify Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins
<p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are functional proteins that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions of more of these proteins are uncovered. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell wall proteins, the hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their protein backbones are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they contain repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the protein-rich walls of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich walls of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan proteins, extensins, and proline-rich proteins, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of MAAB was achieved using available genomic resources and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>) data set. Significant improvement in the detection of HRGPs using multiple-<i>k-</i>mer transcriptome assembly methodology was observed. The MAAB pipeline is readily adaptable and can be modified to optimize the recovery of IDPs from other organisms.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

AIK1, A Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Modulates Abscisic Acid Responses through the MKK5-MPK6 Kinase Cascade<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module involved in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus for appropriate cellular adjustment. This cascade essentially consists of three components: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK, connected to each other by the event of phosphorylation. Here, we report the characterization of a MAPKKK, ABA-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (AIK1), which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). T-DNA insertion mutants of AIK1 showed insensitivity to ABA in terms of both root growth and stomatal response. AIK1 functions in ABA responses via regulation of root cell division and elongation, as well as stomatal responses. The activity of AIK1 is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>), and the Arabidopsis protein phosphatase type 2C, ABI1, a negative regulator of ABA signaling, restricts AIK1 activity by dephosphorylation. Bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation analysis showed that MPK3, MPK6, and AIK1 interact with MKK5. The single mutant seedlings of <i>mpk6</i> and <i>mkk5</i> have similar phenotypes to <i>aik1</i>, but <i>mkk4</i> does not. AIK1 was localized in the cytoplasm and shown to activate MKK5 by protein phosphorylation, which was an ABA-activated process. Constitutively active MKK5 in <i>aik1</i> mutant seedlings <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>s the ABA-insensitive root growth phenotype of <i>aik1</i>. The activity of MPK6 was increased by ABA in wild-type seedlings, but its activation by ABA was impaired in <i>aik1</i> and <i>aik1 mkk5</i> mutants. These findings clearly suggest that the AIK1-MKK5-MPK6 cascade functions in the ABA regulation of primary root growth and stomatal response.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein EMB2654 Is Essential for Trans-Splicing of a Chloroplast Small Ribosomal Subunit Transcript
<p>We report the partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation and subsequent comparative molecular analysis of two nonviable mutants impaired in chloroplast translation, one (<i>emb2394</i>) lacking the RPL6 protein, and the other (<i>emb2654</i>) carrying a mutation in a gene encoding a P-class pentatricopeptide repeat protein. We show that EMB2654 is required for the trans-splicing of the plastid <i>rps12</i> transcript and that therefore the <i>emb2654</i> mutant lacks Rps12 protein and fails to assemble the small subunit of the plastid ribosome, explaining the loss of plastid translation and consequent embryo-lethal phenotype. Predictions of the EMB2654 binding site match a small RNA “footprint” located on the 5′ half of the trans-spliced intron that is almost absent in the partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed mutant. EMB2654 binds sequence specifically to this target sequence in vitro. Altered patterns in nuclease-protected small RNA fragments in <i>emb2654</i> show that EMB2654 binding must be an early step in, or prior to, the formation of a large protein-RNA complex covering the free ends of the two <i>rps12</i> intron halves.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice
<p><i>Phosphate overaccumulator2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in rice protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the “WCGPC” motif of Trxhs were required for the interaction. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts confirmed the interaction of OsPHO2 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and PHOSPHATE1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and rice seedlings. Characterization of rice <i>pho2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic <i>OsPHO2</i> or <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native <i>OsPHO2</i>. Moreover, the suppression of <i>OsTrxh1</i> (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which fine-tune its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in rice.</p>

Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques
<p>Hybridization has played an important role in the evolution of many lineages. With the growing availability of genomic tools and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic tools are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.</p>

Membrane Proteomic Insights into the Physiology and Taxonomy of an Oleaginous Green Microalga
<p><i>Ettlia</i> <i>oleoabundans</i> is a nonsequenced oleaginous green microalga. Despite the significant biotechnological interest in producing value-added compounds from the acyl lipids of this microalga, a basic understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of oleaginous microalgae is lacking, especially under nitrogen deprivation conditions known to trigger lipid accumulation. Using an RNA sequencing-based proteomics approach together with manual annotation, we are able to provide, to our knowledge, the first membrane proteome of an oleaginous microalga. This approach allowed the identification of novel proteins in <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including two photoprotection-related proteins, Photosystem II Subunit S and Maintenance of Photosystem II under High Light1, which were considered exclusive to higher photosynthetic organisms, as well as Retinitis Pigmentosa Type 2-Clathrin Light Chain, a membrane protein with a novel domain architecture. Free-flow zonal electrophoresis of microalgal membranes coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proved to be a useful technique for determining the intracellular location of proteins of interest. Carbon-flow compartmentalization in <i>E. oleoabundans</i> was modeled using this information. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of protein markers and 18S ribosomal DNA support the reclassification of <i>E. oleoabundans</i> within the trebouxiophycean microalgae, rather than with the Chlorophyceae class, in which it is currently classified, indicating that it may not be closely related to the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. A detailed survey of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes taking place in the membranes of nitrogen-deprived <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including lipid metabolism, provides insights into the basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y of this nonmodel organism.</p>

Two SERK Receptor-Like Kinases Interact with EMS1 to Control Anther Cell Fate Determination
<p>Cell signaling pathways mediated by leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are essential for plant growth, development, and defense. The EMS1 (EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1) LRR-RLK and its small protein ligand TPD1 (TAPETUM DETERMINANT1) play a fundamental role in somatic and reproductive cell differentiation during early anther development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, it is unclear whether other cell surface molecules serve as coregulators of EMS1. Here, we show that SERK1 (SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1) and SERK2 LRR-RLKs act redundantly as coregulatory and physical partners of EMS1. The <i>SERK1</i>/<i>2</i> genes function in the same genetic pathway as <i>EMS1</i> in anther development. Bimolecular fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation, Forster resonance energy transfer, and coimmunoprecipitation approaches revealed that SERK1 interacted biochemically with EMS1. Transphosphorylation of EMS1 by SERK1 enhances EMS1 kinase activity. Among 12 in vitro autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation sites identified by tandem mass spectrometry, seven of them were found to be critical for EMS1 autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation test results suggest that phosphorylation of EMS1 is required for its function in anther development. Collectively, these data provide genetic and biochemical evidence of the interaction and phosphorylation between SERK1/2 and EMS1 in anther development.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments

To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> genes, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C gene (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C genes. A larger 5′ extended gene could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ed <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in gene C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> gene within the larger C<sub>B</sub> gene and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complement</span></strong>ation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemolysi</span></strong>s, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemolysi</span></strong>s and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNA in early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos reveals hundreds of conserved translated sORFs
<p>There is growing recognition that small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding peptides shorter than 100 amino acids are an important class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome, with several already identified to play critical roles in growth, development, and disease. However, our understanding of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical importance has been hindered owing to the significant technical challenges limiting their annotation. Here we combined ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs with rigorous conservation analysis to identify a comprehensive population of translated sORFs during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis. In total, we identify 399 sORFs, including those previously annotated but without evidence of translational capacity, those found within transcripts previously classified as non-coding, and those not previously known to be transcribed. Further, we find, for the first time, evidence for translation of many sORFs with different isoforms, suggesting their regulation is as complex as longer ORFs. Furthermore, many sORFs are found not associated with ribosomes in late-stage <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, suggesting that many of the translated sORFs may have stage-specific functions during embryogenesis. These results thus provide the first comprehensive annotation of the sORFs present during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis, a necessary basis for a detailed delineation of their function in embryogenesis and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes.</p>

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y and mechanisms driving disease. However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA amplification strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and diseased heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury. Clustering analysis based on differential gene expression unveiled known and novel markers of all main cardiac cell types. Based on differential gene expression, we could identify multiple subpopulations within a certain cell type. Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of disease-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor β triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and diseased adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac cells, as well as cell type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac disease. This new approach provides a wealth of novel insights into molecular changes that underlie the cellular processes relevant for cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y and pathophysiology. Applying this technology could lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets relevant for heart disease.</p></sec>

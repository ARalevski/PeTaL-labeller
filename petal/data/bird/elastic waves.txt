Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. As a reference, the PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days. At implantation, the mean PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e for the general-use patients was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial. Patients consistently transmitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e information with a median of 1.27 days between transmissions after 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The first 2000 general-use patients managed with hemodynamic-guided heart failure care had higher PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es at baseline and experienced greater reduction in PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e over time compared with the pivotal CHAMPION clinical trial. These data demonstrate that general use of implantable hemodynamic technology in a nontrial setting leads to significant lowering of PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variability assessed by home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). Home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of home diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e.

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle acceleration by plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and spontaneou<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong></span></strong> generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> fields. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Observation of chiral phonons
<p>Chirality reveals symmetry breaking of the fundamental interaction of elementary particles. In condensed matter, for example, the chirality of electrons governs many unconventional transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Here we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>s can exhibit intrinsic chirality in monolayer tungsten diselenide. The broken inversion symmetry of the lattice lifts the degeneracy of clockwise and counterclockwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> modes at the corners of the Brillouin zone. We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>s by the intervalley transfer of holes through hole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> interactions during the indirect infrared absorption, and we confirmed their chirality by the infrared circular dichroism arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation.

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and flow velocity and central aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surface wav</span></strong>es with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in cell signaling.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e periods, the tracheal partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the bone marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e-overloaded myocardium. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that IL10 suppresses Smad–miRNA-21–mediated activation of BM-FPCs and thus modulates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

We report the influence of adherence to antihypertensive treatment on blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred six patients with hypertension resistant to 4 weeks of treatment with indapamide 1.5 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d (or irbesartan 300 mg/d), and amlodipine 10 mg/d were randomly assigned to renal denervation plus standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, or the same antihypertensive treatment alone. For standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, spironolactone 25 mg/d, bisoprolol 10 mg/d, prazosin 5 mg/d, and rilmenidine 1 mg/d were sequentially added at monthly visits if home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was ≥135/85 mm Hg after randomization. We assessed adherence to antihypertensive treatment at 6 months by drug screening in urine/plasma samples from 85 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The numbers of fully adherent (20/40 versus 21/45), partially nonadherent (13/40 versus 20/45), or completely nonadherent patients (7/40 versus 4/45) to antihypertensive treatment were not different in the renal denervation and the control groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.3605). The difference in the change in daytime ambulatory systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from baseline to 6 months between the 2 groups was –6.7 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0461) in fully adherent and –7.8 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0996) in nonadherent (partially nonadherent plus completely nonadherent) patients.

Synchrotron radiation from an accelerating light pulse
<p>Synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—namely, electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion produced by charges moving in a curved path—is regularly generated at large-scale facilities where giga–electron volt electrons move along kilometer-long circular paths. We use a metasurface to bend light and demonstrate synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion produced by a subpicosecond pulse, which moves along a circular arc of radius 100 micrometers inside a nonlinear crystal. The emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, in the terahertz frequency range, results from the nonlinear polarization induced by the pulse. The generation of synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion from a pulse revolving about a circular trajectory holds promise for the development of on-chip terahertz sources.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, shear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and shear properties. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s have been elusive in the direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismic wav</span></strong>efield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in the earthquake coda correlation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses
<p>The specific effects of sleep on synaptic plasticity remain unclear. We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripple oscillations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples during slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the learning of new memories. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Using DNA, radiation therapy gets personal

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. However, cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast cancer treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>ized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>ized pore fluid.</p>

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation
<p>Understanding how auroral radio emissions are produced by magnetized bodies requires in situ measurements within their source region.

Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles.

One-third of global protected land is under intense human pressure

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> result.</p>

Quantum acoustics with superconducting qubits
<p>Mechanical objects have important practical applications in the fields of quantum information and metrology as quantum memories or transducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. The field of electromechanics is in pursuit of a robust and highly coherent device that couples motion to nonlinear quantum objects such as superconducting qubits. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-frequency bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> resonator that is strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit using piezoelectric transduction with a cooperativity of 260. We measure qubit and mechanical coherence times on the order of 10 microseconds. Our device requires only simple fabrication methods and provides controllable access to a multitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> modes. We demonstrate quantum control and measurement on gigahertz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>s at the single-quantum level.</p>

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet
<p>Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a spherically symmetric s-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>.</p>

Measurement of the small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium using close quasar pairs
<p>The distribution of diffuse gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) imprints a series of hydrogen absorption lines on the spectra of distant background quasars known as the Lyman-α forest. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that IGM density fluctuations are suppressed below a characteristic scale where thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e balances gravity. We measured this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e-smoothing scale by quantifying absorption correlations in a sample of close quasar pairs. We compared our measurements to hydrodynamical simulations, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e smoothing is determined by the integrated thermal history of the IGM. Our findings are consistent with standard models for photoionization heating by the ultraviolet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion backgrounds that reionized the universe.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of plants to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on plant phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> pattern, were used to grow and assess plants. Plants subjected to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown plants. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, plants grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-grown plants. Despite high light use efficiency, plants grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that plants grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing plants under square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> growth conditions ultimately fails to predict plant performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer plant productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven selection. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven selection (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-selected SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with nonselected variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated selection signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e wav</span></strong>e and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong></span></strong>form. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH.

We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation.

Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase.

We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006).

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism

Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar.

An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk. Higher systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

Pulmonary Hyperinflation and Left Ventricular Mass
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Left ventricular (LV) mass is an important predictor of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, yet determinants of LV mass are incompletely understood. Pulmonary hyperinflation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may contribute to changes in intrathoracic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e that increase LV wall stress. We therefore hypothesized that residual lung volume in COPD would be associated with greater LV mass.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study recruited smokers 50 to 79 years of age who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease. LV mass was measured by cardiac magnetic resonance. Pulmonary function testing was performed according to guidelines. Regression models were used to adjust for age, sex, body size, blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and other cardiac risk factors. Among 119 MESA COPD Study participants, the mean age was 69±6 years, 55% were male, and 65% had COPD, mostly of mild or moderate severity. Mean LV mass was 128±34 g. Residual lung volume was independently associated with greater LV mass (7.2 g per 1-SD increase in residual volume; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–12; <i>P</i>=0.004) and was similar in magnitude to that of systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (7.6 g per 1-SD increase in systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e; 95% confidence interval, 4.3–11; <i>P</i><0.001). Similar results were observed for the ratio of LV mass to end-diastolic volume (<i>P</i>=0.02) and with hyperinflation measured as residual volume to total lung capacity ratio (<i>P</i>=0.009).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Pulmonary hyperinflation, as measured by residual lung volume or residual lung volume to total lung capacity ratio, is associated with greater LV mass.</p></sec>

The Global Cardiovascular Risk Transition
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>It is commonly assumed that cardiovascular disease risk factors are associated with affluence and Westernization. We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and serum total cholesterol with national income, Western diet, and, for BMI, urbanization in 1980 and 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Country-level risk factor estimates for 199 countries between 1980 and 2008 were from a previous systematic analysis of population-based data. We analyzed the associations between risk factors and per capita national income, a measure of Western diet, and, for BMI, the percentage of the population living in urban areas. In 1980, there was a positive association between national income and population mean BMI, systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, and total cholesterol. By 2008, the slope of the association between national income and systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e became negative for women and zero for men. Total cholesterol was associated with national income and Western diet in both 1980 and 2008. In 1980, BMI rose with national income and then flattened at ≈Int$7000; by 2008, the relationship resembled an inverted U for women, peaking at middle-income levels. BMI had a positive relationship with the percentage of urban population in both 1980 and 2008. Fasting plasma glucose had weaker associations with these country macro characteristics, but it was positively associated with BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The changing associations of metabolic risk factors with macroeconomic variables indicate that there will be a global pandemic of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, together with high blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in low-income countries, unless effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are implemented.</p></sec>

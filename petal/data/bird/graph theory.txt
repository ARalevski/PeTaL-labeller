Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators are phases of matter characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical effects in a unique way: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport without mag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic fields. The underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical physics, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments
<p>Physical systems exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser system exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in the cavity. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without mag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic fields. This work paves the way toward active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

Host DNases prevent vascular occlusion by neutrophil extracellular traps
<p>Platelet and fibrin clots occlude blood vessels in hemostasis and thrombosis. Here we report a noncanonical mechanism for vascular occlusion based on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), DNA fibers released by neutrophils during inflammation. We investigated which host factors control NETs in vivo and found that two deoxyribonucleases (DNases), DNase1 and DNase1-like 3, degraded NETs in circulation during sterile neutrophilia and septicemia. In the absence of both DNases, intravascular NETs formed clots that obstructed blood vessels and caused organ damage. Vascular occlusions in patients with severe bacterial infections were associated with a defect to degrade NETs ex vivo and the formation of intravascular NET clots. DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 are independently expressed and thus provide dual host protection against deleterious effects of intravascular NETs.</p>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y and disorder have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical Anderson insulator phase, in which added disorder drives the band structure of a wire from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial wires to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical fluids.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically quantized electromag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases. Furthermore, they host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases of matter.</p>

The pseudokinase MLKL activates PAD4-dependent NET formation in necroptotic neutrophils
<p>Neutrophil extracellular trap (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>) formation can generate short-term, functional anucleate cytoplasts and trigger loss of cell viability. We demonstrated that the necroptotic cell death effector mixed lineage kinase domain–like (MLKL) translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and stimulated downstream NADPH oxidase–independent ROS production, loss of cytoplasmic granules, breakdown of the nuclear membrane, chromatin decondensation, histone hypercitrullination, and extrusion of bacteriostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s. This process was coordinated by receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), which activated the caspase-8–dependent apoptotic or RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic death of mouse and human neutrophils. Ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic deficiency of RIPK3 and MLKL prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> formation but did not prevent cell death, which was because of residual caspase-8–dependent activity. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) was activated downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and was required for maximal histone hypercitrullination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> extrusion. This work defines a distinct signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>work that activates PAD4-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> release for the control of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infection.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on superconductivity in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-insulator switches have involved only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial systems. Here we report reversible, in situ electrostatic on-off switching of superconductivity in the recently established quantum spin Hall insulator monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>). Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer’s ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin.

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical order is often quantified in terms of Chern numbers, each of which classifies a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical singularity. Here, inspired by concepts from high-energy physics, we use quantum simulation based on the spin degrees of freedom of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to characterize a singularity present in five-dimensional non-Abelian gauge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">theori</span></strong>es—a Yang monopole. We quantify the monopole in terms of Chern numbers measured on enclosing manifolds: Whereas the well-known first Chern number vanishes, the second Chern number does not. By displacing the manifold, we induce and observe a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical transition, where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y of the manifold changes to a trivial state.</p>

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical systems.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>) in the surrounding environment. This process is called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>osis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying ge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>s. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y. We show a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system.</p>

Observation of topological superconductivity on the surface of an iron-based superconductor

Most of the proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical superconductors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures.

Observation of fractional Chern insulators in a van der Waals heterostructure

A topological quantum optics interface

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss

Holographic description of a quantum black hole on a computer
<p>Black holes have been predicted to radiate particles and eventually evaporate, which has led to the information loss paradox and implies that the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics may be violated. Superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity, provides a possible solution to the paradox if evaporating black holes can actually be described in terms of standard quantum mechanical systems, as conjectured from the theory. Here, we test this conjecture by calculating the mass of a black hole in the corresponding quantum mechanical system numerically. Our results agree well with the prediction from gravity theory, including the leading quantum gravity correction. Our ability to simulate black holes offers the potential to further explore the yet mysterious nature of quantum gravity through well-established quantum mechanics.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phyloge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Gate-induced superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator

We found that intrinsic superconductivity can be induced in this monolayer 2D TI by mild electrostatic doping at temperatures below 1 kelvin. The 2D TI–superconductor transition can be driven by applying a small gate voltage. This discovery offers possibilities for gate-controlled devices combining superconductivity and nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties, and could provide a basis for quantum information schemes based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical protection.</p>

Neutrophil extracellular traps produced during inflammation awaken dormant cancer cells in mice
<p>Cancer cells from a primary tumor can disseminate to other tissues, remaining dormant and clinically undetectable for many years. Little is known about the cues that cause these dormant cells to awaken, resume proliferating, and develop into metastases. Studying mouse models, we found that sustained lung inflammation caused by tobacco smoke exposure or nasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide converted disseminated, dormant cancer cells to aggressively growing metastases. Sustained inflammation induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and these were required for awakening dormant cancer. Mechanistic analysis revealed that two NET-associated proteases, neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase 9, sequentially cleaved laminin. The proteolytically remodeled laminin induced proliferation of dormant cancer cells by activating integrin α3β1 signaling. Antibodies against NET-remodeled laminin prevented awakening of dormant cells. Therapies aimed at preventing dormant cell awakening could potentially prolong the survival of cancer patients.</p>

Optical skyrmion lattice in evanescent electromagnetic fields
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical defects play a key role in a variety of physical systems, ranging from high-energy to solid-state physics. A skyrmion is a type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical defect that has shown promise for applications in the fields of mag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic storage and spintronics. We show that optical skyrmion lattices can be generated using evanescent electromag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic fields and demonstrate this using surface plasmon polaritons, imaged by phase-resolved near-field optical microscopy. We show how the optical skyrmion lattice exhibits robustness to imperfections while the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical domain walls in the lattice can be continuously tuned, changing the spatial structure of the skyrmions from bubble type to Néel type. Extending the generation of skyrmions to photonic systems provides various possibilities for applications in optical information processing, transfer, and storage.</p>

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator
<p>Materials whose gapless surface states are protected by crystal symmetries include mirror <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical crystalline insulators and nonsymmorphic hourglass insulators. There exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal symmetries, captured by the 17 “wallpaper groups.” Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical crystalline insulators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem. We theoretically predict the presence of this phase in Sr<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub> in space group 127 (<i>P</i>4<i>/mbm)</i>.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures
<p>Weyl points are the crossings of linearly dispersing energy bands of three-dimensional crystals, providing the opportunity to explore a variety of intriguing phenomena such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected surface states and chiral anomalies. However, the lack of an ideal Weyl system in which the Weyl points all exist at the same energy and are separated from any other bands poses a serious limitation to the further development of Weyl physics and potential applications. By experimentally characterizing a microwave photonic crystal of saddle-shaped metallic coils, we observed ideal Weyl points that are related to each other through symmetry operations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical surface states exhibiting helicoidal structure have also been demonstrated. Our system provides a photonic platform for exploring ideal Weyl systems and developing possible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical devices.</p>

Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century
<p>Ocean acidification refers to the lowering of the ocean’s pH due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Coral reef calcification is expected to decrease as the oceans become more acidic. Dissolving calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) sands could greatly exacerbate reef loss associated with reduced calcification but is presently poorly constrained. Here we show that CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution in reef sediments across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state (Ω<sub>ar</sub>) of overlying seawater and that CaCO<sub>3</sub> sediment dissolution is 10-fold more sensitive to ocean acidification than coral calcification. Consequently, reef sediments globally will transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> precipitation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> dissolution when seawater Ω<sub>ar</sub> reaches 2.92 ± 0.16 (expected circa 2050 CE). Notably, some reefs are already experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> sediment dissolution.</p>

Distinguishing a Majorana zero mode using spin-resolved measurements
<p>One-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical superconductors host Majorana zero modes (MZMs), the nonlocal property of which could be exploited for quantum computing applications. We use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy to show that MZMs realized in self-assembled Fe chains on the surface of Pb have a spin polarization that exceeds that stemming from the mag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ism of these chains. This feature, captured by our model calculations, is a direct consequence of the nonlocality of the Hilbert space of MZMs emerging from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical band structure. Our study establishes spin-polarization measurements as a diagnostic tool to distinguish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical MZMs from trivial in-gap states of a superconductor.</p>

Estimating the health benefits of environmental regulations
<p>Assessing health benefits of policies addressing environmental contaminants is important for decision-making and for informing the public about how policy affects their welfare (<i>1</i>). Benefits analysis, one side of benefit-cost analysis (BCA), can be relatively straightforward when sufficient data are available on dose-response relationships, changes in exposure expected from a proposed policy, and other key inputs. But despite progress, benefits analysis for health effects is needlessly constrained by analytic practices that are scientifically outdated and inconsistent with economic theory. These limitations can result in exclusion of important health effects from the estimated benefits of reducing exposure to toxic environmental contaminants, which, in turn, affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> benefits calculations that inform public policy. Fortunately, economic theory and scientific advances in the risk assessment literature provide a way forward.</p>

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline symmetry leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected surface states with a chiral spin texture, rendering them potential candidates for spintronics applications. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of one-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic surface step edges of the three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent stability and protects them from backscattering. We experimentally show that this stability results in a striking robustness to defects, strong mag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>ic fields, and elevated temperature.</p>

Quantized Faraday and Kerr rotation and axion electrodynamics of a 3D topological insulator
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators have been proposed to be best characterized as bulk mag<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong>oelectric materials that show response functions quantized in terms of fundamental physical constants.

For fields higher than 5 tesla, we observed quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations, whereas the dc transport is still semiclassical.

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns
<p>Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical defects, heading toward defects of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical charge and avoiding negative charges. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y of active matter.</p>

Assessing treatment outcomes using a single question
<p>Satisfaction with care is important to both patients   and to those who pay for it. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), widely   used in the service industries, has been introduced into the NHS   as the ‘friends and family test’; an overarching measure of patient   satisfaction. It assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending   the healthcare received to another, and is seen as a discriminator   of healthcare performance. We prospectively assessed 6186 individuals   undergoing primary lower limb joint replacement at a single university   hospital to determine the Net Promoter Score for joint replacements   and to evaluate which factors contributed to the response. </p><p>Achieving pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, confidence interval   (CI) 1.83 to 2.49), the meeting of pre-operative expectation (OR   2.57, CI 2.24 to 2.97), and the hospital experience (OR 2.33, CI   2.03 to 2.68) are the domains that explain whether a patient would   recommend joint replacement services. These three factors, combined   with the type of surgery undertaken (OR 2.31, CI 1.68 to 3.17),   drove a predictive model that was able to explain 95% of the variation   in the patient’s recommendation response. Though intuitively similar,   this ‘recommendation’ metric was found to be materially different   to satisfaction responses. The difference between THR (NPS 71) and   TKR (NPS 49) suggests that no overarching score for a department   should be used without an adjustment for case mix. However, the   Net Promoter Score does measure a further important dimension to   our existing metrics: the patient experience of healthcare delivery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:622–8.</p>

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient waves and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.</p>

Fish reproductive-energy output increases disproportionately with body size
<p>Body size determines total reproductive-energy output. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">theori</span></strong>es assume reproductive output is a fixed proportion of size, with respect to mass, but formal macroecological tests are lacking.

We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how reproduction scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting cause fish sizes to decline; our results provide quantitative estimates of how these declines affect fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.</p>

Unexpected reversal of C<sub>3</sub> versus C<sub>4</sub> grass response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during a 20-year field experiment

We document a reversal from this expected C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> contrast. Over the first 12 years of a 20-year free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment with 88 C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> grassland plots, we found that biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>3</sub> but not C<sub>4</sub> plots, as expected.

Soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> nitrogen mineralization rates, an index of soil nitrogen supply, exhibited a similar shift: <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> first enhanced but later depressed rates in C<sub>3</sub> plots, with the opposite true in C<sub>4</sub> plots, partially explaining the reversal of the <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> biomass response. These findings challenge the current C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> paradigm and show that even the best-supported short-term drivers of plant response to global change might not predict long-term results.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">theori</span></strong>es that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Selective formation of γ-lactams via C–H amidation enabled by tailored iridium catalysts
<p>Intramolecular insertion of metal nitrenes into carbon-hydrogen bonds to form γ-lactam rings has traditionally been hindered by competing isocyanate formation. We report the application of theory and mechanism studies to optimize a class of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) catalysts for suppression of this competing pathway. Modulation of the stereoelectronic properties of the auxiliary bidentate ligands to be more electron-donating was suggested by density functional theory calculations to lower the C–H insertion barrier favoring the desired reaction. These catalysts transform a wide range of 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones, carbonylnitrene precursors easily accessible from carboxylic acids, into the corresponding γ-lactams via sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H amidation with exceptional selectivity. The power of this method was further demonstrated by the successful late-stage functionalization of amino acid derivatives and other bioactive molecules.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the background star’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

Condensin movement scales linearly with time, providing evidence for an active transport mechanism. These data support a model in which SMC complexes function by processively enlarging DNA loops.

Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?
<p>Animals use the neurotransmitter dopamine to encode the relationship between their responses and reward. Reinforcement learning theory (<i>1</i>) successfully explains the role of phasic bursts of dopamine in terms of future reward maximization. Yet, dopamine clearly plays other roles in shaping behavior that have no obvious relationship to reinforcement learning, including modulating the rate at which our subjective sense of time grows in real time. On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of dopamine in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of dopamine function in timing—the dopamine clock hypothesis (<i>3</i>). They may also help explain empirical phenomena that challenge the reinforcement learning account of dopamine function.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">net</span></strong> photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

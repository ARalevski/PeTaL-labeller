Adult–larval vibrational communication in paper wasps: the role of abdominal wagging in <i>Polistes dominula</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Vibrational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">playback</span></strong> experiments demonstrate the hypothesized role of vibrations in adult–larval communications in paper wasps and do not support the long-held hypothesis of salivary release modulation.</p>

Selective reactions to different killer whale call categories in two delphinid species
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Characterization of the anti-predator behavior of two delphinid species using controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">playback</span></strong> of killer whale calls suggests that structural features of the calls convey information about predatory risk.</p>

Using sounds for making decisions: greater tube-nosed bats prefer antagonistic calls over non-communicative sounds when feeding
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> In this study we used sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">playback</span></strong> to test the importance of communication sounds of bats as contextual information for decision making for place preference during feeding.</p>

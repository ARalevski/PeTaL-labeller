The Thiamine Biosynthesis Gene <i>THI1</i> Promotes Nodule Growth and Seed Maturation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e (vitamin B1) is essential for living organisms. Unlike animals, plants can synthesize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e. In <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, the expression of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e biosynthesis genes, <i>THI1</i> and <i>THIC</i>, was enhanced by inoculation with rhizobia but not by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. <i>THIC</i> and <i>THI2</i> (a <i>THI1</i> paralog) were expressed in uninoculated leaves. <i>THI2</i>-knockdown plants and the transposon insertion mutant <i>thiC</i> had chlorotic leaves. This typical phenotype of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e deficiency was rescued by an exogenous supply of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e. In wild-type plants, <i>THI1</i> was expressed mainly in roots and nodules, and the <i>thi1</i> mutant had green leaves even in the absence of exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e. <i>THI1</i> was highly expressed in actively dividing cells of nodule primordia. The <i>thi1</i> mutant had small nodules, and this phenotype was rescued by exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e and by <i>THI1</i> complementation. Exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e increased nodule diameter, but the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization was unaffected in the <i>thi1</i> mutant or by exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e. Expression of symbiotic marker genes was induced normally, implying that mainly nodule growth was delayed in the <i>thi1</i> mutant. Furthermore, this mutant formed many immature seeds with reduced seed weight. These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>e biosynthesis mediated by THI1 enhances nodule enlargement and is required for seed development in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Parts-Prospecting for a High-Efficiency Thiamin Thiazole Biosynthesis Pathway
<p>Plants synthesize the thiazole precursor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong> (cThz-P) via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>4 (THI4), a suicide enzyme that mediates one reaction cycle and must then be degraded and resynthesized. It has been estimated that this THI4 turnover consumes 2% to 12% of the maintenance energy budget and that installing an energy-efficient alternative pathway could substantially increase crop yield potential. Available data point to two natural alternatives to the suicidal THI4 pathway: (i) nonsuicidal prokaryotic THI4s that lack the active-site Cys residue on which suicide activity depends, and (ii) an uncharacterized thiazole synthesis pathway in flowers of the tropical arum lily <i>Caladium bicolor</i> that enables production and emission of large amounts of the cThz-P analog 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole (MVT). We used functional complementation of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> Δ<i>thiG</i> strain to identify a nonsuicidal bacterial THI4 (from <i>Thermovibrio ammonificans</i>) that can function in conditions like those in plant cells. We explored whether <i>C. bicolor</i> synthesizes MVT de novo via a novel route, via a suicidal or a nonsuicidal THI4, or by catabolizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong>. Analysis of developmental changes in MVT emission, extractable MVT, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong> level, and THI4 expression indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> flowers make MVT de novo via a massively expressed THI4 and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thiamin</span></strong> is not involved. Functional complementation tests indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4, which has the active-site Cys needed to operate suicidally, may be capable of suicidal and – in hypoxic conditions – nonsuicidal operation. <i>T. ammonificans</i> and <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4s are thus candidate parts for rational redesign or directed evolution of efficient, nonsuicidal THI4s for use in crop improvement.</p>

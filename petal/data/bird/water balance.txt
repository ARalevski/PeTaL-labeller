Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the time course of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edema</span></strong> reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edema</span></strong> on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edema</span></strong> extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edema</span></strong> wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edema</span></strong> in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edema</span></strong> highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">body fluid</span></strong>, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e, would be lethal.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, thereby ens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">equilibrium</span></strong> potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g a 17-year follow-up.

We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e samples.

However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e samples resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar.

Vacuolar Phosphate Transporters Contribute to Systemic Phosphate Homeostasis Vital for Reproductive Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Vacuolar storage of phosphate (Pi) is essential for Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in plants. Recent studies have identified a family of vacuolar Pi transporters, VPTs (PHT5s), responsible for vacuolar sequestration of Pi. We report here that both VPT1 and VPT3 contribute to cytosol-to-vacuole Pi partitioning. Although VPT1 plays a predominant role, VPT3 is particularly important when VPT1 is absent. Our data suggested that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was more defective in Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s than the <i>vpt1</i> single mutant, as indicated by Pi accumulation capacity, vacuolar Pi influx, subcellular Pi allocation, and plant adaptability to changing Pi status. The remaining member of the VPT family, VPT2 (PHT5;2), did not appear to contribute to Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in such assays. Particularly interesting is the finding that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was impaired in reproductive development with shortened siliques and impaired seed set under sufficient Pi, and this phenotype was not found in the <i>vpt1 vpt2</i> and <i>vpt2 vpt3</i> double mutants. Measurements of Pi contents revealed Pi over-accumulation in the floral organs of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> as compared with the wild type. Further analysis identified excess Pi in the pistil as inhibitory to pollen tube growth, and thus seed yield, in the mutant plants. Reducing the Pi levels in culture medium or mutation of PHO1, a Pi transport protein responsible for root-shoot transport, restored the seed set of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i>. Thus, VPTs, through their function in vacuolar Pi sequestration, control the fine-tuning of systemic Pi allocation, which is particularly important for reproductive development.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cation/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and are critical for cell expansion and plant stress acclimation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar ion and pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Additional K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cation/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cation/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and in growth and development.</p>

Modulation of Plant Salicylic Acid-Associated Immune Responses via Glycosylation of Dihydroxybenzoic Acids
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant innate immunity. The deployment of SA-associated immune responses is primarily affected by SA concentration, which is determined by a balance between SA biosynthesis and catabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating SA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a unique UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT76D1, which plays an important role in SA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and associated immune responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Expression of <i>UGT76D1</i> was induced by treatment with both the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 and SA. Overexpression of <i>UGT76D1</i> resulted in high SA accumulation, significant up-regulation of pathogen-related genes, and a hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesion mimic phenotype. This HR-like phenotype was not observed following <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression in SA-deficient <i>NahG</i> transgenic or <i>sid2</i> plants, suggesting that the phenotype is SA dependent. Biochemical assays showed that UGT76D1 glycosylated 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), the major catabolic forms of SA, to their Glc and Xyl conjugates in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a mutant background blocked in the formation of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression did not cause a HR-like lesion mimic phenotype. Following infection with <i>Pst</i> DC3000, <i>UGT76D1</i> knockout mutants displayed a delayed immune response, with reduced levels of DHBA glycosides and SA, and down-regulated SA synthase expression. By contrast, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression lines showed an enhanced immune response and increased SA biosynthesis before and after pathogen infection. Thus, we propose that UGT76D1 plays an important role in SA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and plant immune responses by facilitating glycosylation of dihydroxybenzoic acids.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g pollen development.</p>

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target effects through adenosine-related mechanisms.

All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an effect supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021).

Unique BIR domain sets determine inhibitor of apoptosis protein–driven cell death and NOD2 complex signal specificity
<p>The mammalian IAPs, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), play pivotal roles in innate immune signaling and inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, often working in parallel or in conjunction at a signaling complex. IAPs direct both nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 (NOD2) signaling complexes and cell death mechanisms to appropriately regulate inflammation. Although it is known that XIAP is critical for NOD2 signaling and that the loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2 blunts NOD2 activity, it is unclear whether these three highly related proteins can compensate for one another in NOD2 signaling or in mechanisms governing apoptosis or necroptosis. This potential redundancy is critically important, given that genetic loss of XIAP causes both very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 2 (XLP-2) and that the overexpression of cIAP1 and cIAP2 is linked to both carcinogenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Given the therapeutic interest in IAP inhibition and the potential toxicities associated with disruption of inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, we used synthetic biology techniques to examine the functional redundancies of key domains in the IAPs. From this analysis, we defined the features of the IAPs that enable them to function at overlapping signaling complexes but remain independent and functionally exclusive in their roles as E3 ubiquitin ligases in innate immune and inflammatory signaling.</p>

Thrombospondin-1 promotes matrix homeostasis by interacting with collagen and lysyl oxidase precursors and collagen cross-linking sites
<p>Fibrillar collagens of the extracellular matrix are critical for tissue structure and physiology; however, excessive or abnormal deposition of collagens is a defining feature of fibrosis. Regulatory mechanisms that act on collagen fibril assembly potentially offer new targets for antifibrotic treatments. Tissue weakening, altered collagen fibril morphologies, or both, are shared phenotypes of mice lacking matricellular thrombospondins. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) plays an indirect role in collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1). We found that TSP1 also affects collagen fibril formation directly. Compared to skin from wild-type mice, skin from <i>Thbs1</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice had reduced collagen cross-linking and reduced prolysyl oxidase (proLOX) abundance with increased conversion to catalytically active LOX. In vitro, TSP1 bound to both the C-propeptide domain of collagen I and the highly conserved KGHR sequences of the collagen triple-helical domain that participate in cross-linking. TSP1 also bound to proLOX and inhibited proLOX processing by bone morphogenetic protein-1. In human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), TSP1 and collagen I colocalized in intracellular vesicles and on extracellular collagen fibrils, whereas TSP1 and proLOX colocalized only in intracellular vesicles. Inhibition of LOX-mediated collagen cross-linking did not prevent the extracellular association between collagen and TSP1; however, treatment of HDFs with KGHR-containing, TSP1-binding, triple-helical peptides disrupted the collagen-TSP1 association, perturbed the collagen extracellular matrix, and increased myofibroblastic differentiation in a manner that depended on TGF-β receptor 1. Thus, the extracellular KGHR-dependent interaction of TSP1 with fibrillar collagens contributes to fibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, lipid-overloaded hepatocytes and in the livers of patients with hepatic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

Caveolin-1–mediated internalization of the vitamin C transporter SVCT2 in microglia triggers an inflammatory phenotype
<p>Vitamin C is essential for the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). The plasma membrane sodium–vitamin C cotransporter 2 (SVCT2) is the primary mediator of vitamin C uptake in neurons. SVCT2 specifically transports ascorbate, the reduced form of vitamin C, which acts as a reducing agent. We demonstrated that ascorbate uptake through SVCT2 was critical for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s of microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the CNS that are essential for proper functioning of the nervous tissue. We found that depletion of SVCT2 from the plasma membrane triggered a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia and resulted in microglia activation. Src-mediated phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on Tyr<sup>14</sup> in microglia induced the internalization of SVCT2. Ascorbate treatment, SVCT2 overexpression, or blocking SVCT2 internalization prevented the activation of microglia. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of the ascorbate transport system for microglial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and hints that dysregulation of ascorbate transport might play a role in neurological disorders.</p>

Stable Casimir equilibria and quantum trapping

mTOR regulates metabolic adaptation of APCs in the lung and controls the outcome of allergic inflammation

An adipo-biliary-uridine axis that regulates energy homeostasis
<p>Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside present at high levels in the plasma of rodents and humans, is critical for RNA synthesis, glycogen deposition, and many other essential cellular processes. It also contributes to systemic metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that plasma uridine levels are regulated by fasting and refeeding in mice, rats, and humans. Fasting increases plasma uridine levels, and this increase relies largely on adipocytes. In contrast, refeeding reduces plasma uridine levels through biliary clearance. Elevation of plasma uridine is required for the drop in body temperature that occurs d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g fasting.

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots

TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased temperatures to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body temperature, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body temperature on diverse disease states.

The Chromatin Factor HNI9 and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 Maintain ROS Homeostasis under High Nitrogen Provision
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can accumulate in cells at excessive levels, leading to unbalanced redox states and to potential oxidative stress, which can have damaging effects on the molecular components of plant cells. Several environmental conditions have been described as causing an elevation of ROS production in plants. Consequently, activation of detoxification responses is necessary to maintain ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s at physiological levels. Misregulation of detoxification systems d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g oxidative stress can ultimately cause growth retardation and developmental defects. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants grown in a high nitrogen (N) environment express a set of genes involved in detoxification of ROS that maintain ROS at physiological levels. We show that the chromatin factor HIGH NITROGEN INSENSITIVE9 (HNI9) is an important mediator of this response and is required for the expression of detoxification genes. Mutation in HNI9 leads to elevated ROS levels and ROS-dependent phenotypic defects under high but not low N provision. In addition, we identify ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 as a major transcription factor required for activation of the detoxification program under high N. Our results demonstrate the requirement of a balance between N metabolism and ROS production, and our work establishes major regulators required to control ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s under conditions of excess N.</p>

Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism Impacts Triacylglycerol Homeostasis in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Nitrogen (N) starvation-induced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and its complex relationship with starch metabolism in algal cells, has been intensively studied; however, few studies have examined the interaction between amino acid metabolism and TAG biosynthesis. Here, via a forward genetic screen for TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, we isolated a <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) mutant (<i>bkdE1α</i>) that is deficient in the E1α subunit of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. Metabolomics analysis revealed a defect in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in <i>bkdE1α</i>. Furthermore, this mutant accumulated 30% less TAG than the parental strain d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g N starvation and was compromised in TAG remobilization upon N resupply. Intriguingly, the rate of mitochondrial respiration was 20% to 35% lower in <i>bkdE1α</i> compared with the parental strains. Three additional knockout mutants of the other components of the BCKDH complex exhibited phenotypes similar to that of <i>bkdE1α</i>. Transcriptional responses of <i>BCKDH</i> to different N status were consistent with its role in TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s. Collectively, these results indicate that branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributes to TAG metabolism by providing carbon precursors and ATP, thus highlighting the complex interplay between distinct subcellular metabolisms for oil storage in green microalgae.</p>

Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and physiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi network, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. Phenotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal pH in the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and salt tolerance.

Evidence for Exaptation of the <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> M20D Peptidase MpILR1 into the Tracheophyte Auxin Regulatory Pathway
<p>Auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s is tightly regulated by several mechanisms, including conjugation of the hormone to specific moieties, such as amino acids or sugar. The inactive phytohormone conjugate is stored in large pools in plants and hydrolyzed to regain full activity. Many conjugate hydrolases (M20D metallopeptidases) have been identified and characterized throughout the plant kingdom. We have traced this regulatory gene family back to liverwort (<i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>), a member of the most ancient extant land plant lineage, which emerged approximately 475 million years ago. We have isolated and characterized a single hydrolase homologue, dubbed <i>M. polymorpha</i> IAA-Leucine Resistant1 (MpILR1), from liverwort. MpILR1 can hydrolyze two auxin (indole acetic acid [IAA]) substrates (IAA-Leucine and IPA-Alanine) at very low levels of activity, but it cannot hydrolyze the two native auxin conjugates of liverwort (IAA-Glycine and IAA-Valine). We conclude from these results that liverwort likely does not employ active auxin conjugate hydrolysis as a regulatory mechanism and that conjugate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s likely takes place in liverwort by passive background degradation. Furthermore, we present evidence that MpILR1 was probably exapted by tracheophytes over evolutionary time into the auxin regulatory pathway.</p>

NMT1 and NMT3 <i>N</i>-Methyltransferase Activity Is Critical to Lipid Homeostasis, Morphogenesis, and Reproduction
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major membrane phospholipid and a precursor for major signaling molecules. Understanding its synthesis is important for improving plant growth, nutritional value, and resistance to stress. PC synthesis is complex, involving several interconnected pathways, one of which proceeds from serine-derived phosphoethanolamine to form phosphocholine through three sequential phospho-base methylations catalyzed by phosphoethanolamine <i>N</i>-methyltransferases (PEAMTs). The contribution of this pathway to the production of PC and plant growth has been a matter of some debate. Although a handful of individual PEAMTs have been described, there has not been any in planta investigation of a PEAMT family. Here, we provide a comparative functional analysis of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PEAMTs, NMT1 and the little known NMT3. Analysis of loss-of-function mutants demonstrates that NMT1 and NMT3 synergistically regulate PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, phase transition at the shoot apex, coordinated organ development, and fertility through overlapping but also specific functions. The <i>nmt1 nmt3</i> double mutant shows extensive sterility, drastically reduced PC concentrations, and altered lipid profiles.

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s between starch and lipid synthesis controlled by lipid signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s.</p>

Plants harboring a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of root hair-related genes and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root hair length but formed very short root hairs when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more root hairs than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation.

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g early gynoecium patterning and hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy metals mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s. To examine the level at which heavy metals interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy metals. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy metals modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of metals with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy metal toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy metals.</p>

Tetrahydrofolate Modulates Floral Transition through Epigenetic Silencing
<p>Folates, termed from tetrahydrofolate (THF) and its derivatives, function as coenzymes in one-carbon transfer reactions and play a central role in synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids. Dysfunction of cellular folate metabolism leads to serious defects in plant development; however, the molecular mechanisms of folate-mediated cellular modifications and physiological responses in plants are still largely unclear. Here, we reported that THF controls flowering time by adjusting DNA methylation-regulated gene expression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type seedlings supplied with THF as well as the high endogenous THF content mutant <i>dihydrofolate synthetase folypoly-Glu synthetase homolog B</i> exhibited significant up-regulation of the flowering repressor of <i>Flowering Wageningen</i> and thereby delaying floral transition in a dose-dependent manner. Genome-wide transcripts and DNA methylation profiling revealed that THF reduces DNA methylation so as to manipulate gene expression activity. Moreover, in accompaniment with elevated cellular ratios between monoglutamylated and polyglutamylated folates under increased THF levels, the content of <i>S</i>-adenosylhomo-Cys, a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases, was obviously higher, indicating that enhanced THF accumulation may disturb cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s of the concerted reactions between folate polyglutamylation and folate-dependent DNA methylation. In addition, we found that the loss-of-function mutant of CG DNA methyltransferase MET1 displayed much less responsiveness to THF-associated flowering time alteration. Taken together, our studies revealed a novel regulatory role of THF on epigenetic silencing, which will shed lights on the understanding of interrelations in folate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, epigenetic variation, and flowering control in plants.</p>

The <i>Synechocystis</i> Manganese Exporter Mnx Is Essential for Manganese Homeostasis in Cyanobacteria
<p>The essential micronutrient manganese (Mn) functions as redox-active cofactor in active sites of enzymes and, thus, is involved in various physiological reactions. Moreover, in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, Mn is of special importance, since it is central to the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II. Although Mn is an essential micronutrient, increased amounts are detrimental to the organism; thus, only a small window exists for beneficial concentrations. Accordingly, Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s must be carefully maintained. In contrast to the well-studied uptake mechanisms in cyanobacteria, it is largely unknown how Mn is distributed to the different compartments inside the cell. We identified a protein with so far unknown function as a hypothetical Mn transporter in the cyanobacterial model strain <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and named this protein Mnx for Mn exporter. The knockout mutant Δ<i>mnx</i> showed increased sensitivity toward externally supplied Mn and Mn toxicity symptoms, which could be linked to intracellular Mn accumulation. <sup>54</sup>Mn chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant was not able to release Mn from the internal pool. Microscopic analysis of a Mnx::yellow fluorescent protein fusion showed that the protein resides in the thylakoid membrane. Heterologous expression of <i>mnx</i> suppressed the Mn-sensitive phenotype of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutant Δ<i>pmr1</i>. Our results indicate that Mnx functions as a thylakoid Mn transporter and is a key player in maintaining Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. We propose that Mn export from the cytoplasm into the thylakoid lumen is crucial to prevent toxic cytoplasmic Mn accumulation and to ensure Mn provision to photosystem II.</p>

Ubiquitination-Related MdBT Scaffold Proteins Target a bHLH Transcription Factor for Iron Homeostasis
<p>Iron (Fe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s is crucial for plant growth and development. A network of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors positively regulates Fe uptake d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g iron deficiency. However, their up-regulation or overexpression leads to Fe overload and reactive oxygen species generation, thereby damaging the plants. Here, we found that two BTB/TAZ proteins, MdBT1 and MdBT2, interact with the MbHLH104 protein in apple. In addition, the function of MdBT2 was characterized as a regulator of MdbHLH104 degradation via ubiquitination and the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby controlling the activity of plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and the acquisition of iron. Furthermore, MdBT2 interacted with MdCUL3 proteins, which were required for the MdBT2-mediated ubiquitination modification of MdbHLH104 and its degradation. In sum, our findings demonstrate that MdBT proteins interact with MdCUL3 to bridge the formation of the MdBTs<sup>MdCUL3</sup> complex, which negatively modulates the degradation of the MdbHLH104 protein in response to changes in Fe status to maintain iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in plants.</p>

A Comprehensive Expression Profile of MicroRNAs and Other Classes of Non-Coding Small RNAs in Barley Under Phosphorous-Deficient and -Sufficient Conditions
<p>Phosphorus (P) is essential for plant growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s. However, little is known about P effect on miRNA expression in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). In this study, we used Illumina's next-generation sequencing technology to sequence small RNAs (sRNAs) in barley grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. We identified 221 conserved miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs, of which 55 were only present in P-deficient treatment while 32 only existed in P-sufficient treatment. Total 47 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments (|log<sub>2</sub>| > 1). We also identified many other classes of sRNAs, including sense and antisense sRNAs, repeat-associated sRNAs, transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs and chloroplast-derived sRNAs, and some of which were also significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments. Of all the sRNAs identified, antisense sRNAs were the most abundant sRNA class in both P treatments. Surprisingly, about one-fourth of sRNAs were derived from the chloroplast genome, and a chloroplast-encoded tRNA-derived sRNA was the most abundant sRNA of all the sRNAs sequenced. Our data provide valuable clues for understanding the properties of sRNAs and new insights into the potential roles of miRNAs and other classes of sRNAs in the control of phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s.</p>

Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling supports intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as well as other intestinal epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can support intestinal stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of intestinal epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal intestinal proliferation and differentiation, as well as successful regeneration after radiation injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are dispensable for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, intestinal stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> support the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> intestinal stem cells, inhibited recovery from radiation injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked intestinal proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are dispensable and that stromal production of Wnts can fully support normal m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s.</p>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart failure. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart failure in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart failure, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>g aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">urin</span></strong>e output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

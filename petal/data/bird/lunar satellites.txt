Complexity in targeting membrane proteins
<p>For a cell, making hydrophobic integral membrane proteins (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>s, or transmembrane proteins) is a complicated, but critical, process. All proteins are made by ribosomes in the cytosol, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>s, which account for ∼30% of the proteins encoded in the eukaryotic genome, must also be properly delivered to and inserted into their respective subcellular membranes, a process known as targeting. This is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>ortant because hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>s are rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm to prevent aggregation, which can lead to broad disruptions in cellular homeostasis. Because of the number and diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>s, identifying and targeting them relies on pathways that often overlap in function. The information for targeting, typically stored in hydrophobic α-helical transmembrane domain (TMD) signals in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>s, is recognized by factors that then ferry the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong> client to the destined lipid bilayer. On page 470 of this issue, Guna <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) demonstrate that, for an essential class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>s, the current picture is incomplete. They identify a new targeting pathway for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>s, contributing to the elucidation of how the cell synthesizes this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imp</span></strong>ortant class of proteins.</p>

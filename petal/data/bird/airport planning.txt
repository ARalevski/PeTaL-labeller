Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, indicating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> than across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s into a relatively small number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. Forcing each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s assigned to the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean forests face drought but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these forests. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter drought-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine forests in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and aboveground productivity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-trees. Winter-drought dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are conserved between distantly related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well conserved in photoautotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s out of 41 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that controls osteoclast activity and bone mass in vivo
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts is essential for bone homeostasis. The kinase Src promotes osteoclast activity and is activated in osteoclasts by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. In other contexts, however, PTPROt can inhibit Src activity. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that PTPROt is bifunctional and can dephosphorylate Src both at its inhibitory residue Tyr<sup>527</sup> and its activating residue Tyr<sup>416</sup>. Whereas wild-type and PTPROt knockout mice exhibited similar bone masses, mice in which a putative C-terminal phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, Tyr<sup>399</sup>, in endogenous PTPROt was replaced with phenylalanine had increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast activity. Osteoclasts from the knock-in mice also showed reduced Src activity. Experiments in cultured cells and in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains demonstrated that the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>399</sup> caused PTPROt to dephosphorylate Src at the activating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> pTyr<sup>416</sup>. In contrast, phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> enabled PTPROt to recruit Src through Grb2 and to dephosphorylate Src at the inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> Tyr<sup>527</sup>, thus stimulating Src activity. We conclude that reversible phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that selects between its opposing activities toward Src and maintains a coherent signaling output, and that blocking this phosphorylation event can induce physiological effects in vivo. Because most receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases contain potential phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s at their C termini, we propose that preventing phosphorylation at these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s or its consequences may offer an alternative to inhibiting their catalytic activity to achieve therapeutic benefit.</p>

Dual phosphorylation of Ric-8A enhances its ability to mediate G protein α subunit folding and to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange
<p>Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase-8A (Ric-8A) and Ric-8B are essential biosynthetic chaperones for heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. We provide evidence for the direct regulation of Ric-8A cellular activity by dual phosphorylation. Using proteomics, Western blotting, and mutational analyses, we determined that Ric-8A was constitutively phosphorylated at five serines and threonines by the protein kinase CK2. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> in rat Ric-8A (corresponding to Ser<sup>436</sup> and Thr<sup>441</sup> in human Ric-8A) was required for high-affinity binding to Gα subunits, efficient stimulation of Gα subunit guanine nucleotide exchange, and mediation of Gα subunit folding. The CK2 consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that contain Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> are conserved in Ric-8 homologs from worms to mammals. We found that the homologous residues in mouse Ric-8B, Ser<sup>468</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, were also phosphorylated. Mutation of the genomic copy of <i>ric-8</i> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to encode alanine in the homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s resulted in characteristic <i>ric-8</i> reduction-of-function phenotypes that are associated with defective G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> signaling, including reduced locomotion and defective egg laying. The <i>C. elegans ric-8</i> phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> mutant phenotypes were partially rescued by chemical stimulation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling. These results indicate that dual phosphorylation represents a critical form of conserved Ric-8 regulation and demonstrate that Ric-8 proteins are needed for effective Gα signaling. The position of the CK2-phosphorylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s within a structural model of Ric-8A reveals that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s contribute to a key acidic and negatively charged surface that may be important for its interactions with Gα subunits.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and also varied over time. In addition, field trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ted from a sheltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> to a more wave-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Osteoarticular tissue infection and development of skeletal pathology in murine brucellosis
<p>Brucellosis, a frequent bacterial zoonosis, can produce debilitating chronic disease with involvement of multiple organs in human patients. Whereas acute brucellosis is well studied using the murine animal model, long-term complications of host-pathogen interaction remain largely elusive. Human brucellosis frequently results in persistent, chronic osteoarticular system involvement, with complications such as arthritis, spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Here, we focused on identifying infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in the mouse that parallel <i>Brucella melitensis</i> foci observed in patients. <i>In vivo</i> imaging showed rapid bacterial dispersal to multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of the murine axial skeleton. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of bacteria in bones and limbs, and in the lower spine vertebrae of the axial skeleton where they were preferentially located in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, some animals developed arthritis in paws and spine after infection, but without obvious bacteria in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. The identification of <i>Brucella</i> in the bones of mice corroborates the findings in humans that these osteoarticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are important niches for the persistence of <i>Brucella</i> in the host, but the mechanisms that mediate pathological manifestations in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s remain unclear. Future studies addressing the immune responses within osteoarticular tissue foci could elucidate important tissue injury mediators and <i>Brucella</i> survival strategies.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. We used this data set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Stepwise phosphorylation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> receptor 1 defines cellular responses to leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>
<p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) receptor type 1 (BLT1) is abundant in phagocytic and immune cells and plays crucial roles in various inflammatory diseases. BLT1 is phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues upon stimulation with the inflammatory lipid LTB<sub>4</sub>. Using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis to separate differentially phosphorylated forms of BLT1, we identified two distinct types of phosphorylation, basal and ligand-induced, in the carboxyl terminus of human BLT1. In the absence of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the basal phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s were modified to various degrees, giving rise to many different phosphorylated forms of BLT1. Different concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub> induced distinct phosphorylation events, and these ligand-induced modifications facilitated additional phosphorylation events at the basal phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Because neutrophils migrate toward inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s along a gradient of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the degree of BLT1 phosphorylation likely increases in parallel with the increase in LTB<sub>4</sub> concentration as the cells migrate. At high concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub>, deficiencies in these two types of phosphorylation events impaired chemotaxis and β-hexosaminidase release, a proxy for degranulation, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, respectively. These results suggest that an LTB<sub>4</sub> gradient around inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s enhances BLT1 phosphorylation in a stepwise manner to facilitate the precise migration of phagocytic and immune cells and the initiation of local responses, including degranulation.</p>

Postcatalytic spliceosome structure reveals mechanism of 3′–splice site selection

Such multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating protein function—a protein with <i>n</i> phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. Proteins can be substrates for several protein kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s by a single protein kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> phosphorylation, whereby a protein kinase progressively phosphorylates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to samples from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury. Here, we examined the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells.

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the activity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s to fine-tune a transporter, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

Structural basis for the preference of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> phosphatase RLPH2 for tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates
<p>Despite belonging to the phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana Rhizobiales</i>-like phosphatase 2 (RLPH2) strongly prefers substrates bearing phosphorylated tyrosine residues. We solved the structures of RLPH2 crystallized in the presence or absence of sodium tungstate. These structures revealed the presence of a central domain that forms a binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> for two divalent metal ions that closely resembles that of other PPP-family enzymes. Unique structural elements from two flanking domains suggest a mechanism for the selective dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues. Cocrystallization with the phosphate mimetic tungstate also suggests how positively charged residues that are highly conserved in the RLPH2 class form an additional pocket that is specific for a phosphothreonine residue located near the phosphotyrosine residue that is bound to the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>-directed mutagenesis confirmed that this auxiliary recognition element facilitates the recruitment of dual-phosphorylated substrates containing a pTxpY motif.</p>

TCR-stimulated changes in cell surface CD46 expression generate type 1 regulatory T cells
<p>A lack of regulatory T cell function is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) effector cells into interleukin-10 (IL-10)–secreting type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and multiple O-glycosylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-stimulated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune synapse switched T cells from producing the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to producing IL-10. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a CD3-stimulated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of cell surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying the regulatory function of CD46 on T cells. Our findings may explain why this pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS pathogenesis that could help to design future immunotherapies.</p>

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope

Structure of the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase complex gives insight into eukaryotic N-glycosylation

Here we describe the atomic structure of yeast OST determined by cryo–electron microscopy, revealing a conserved subunit arrangement. The active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> of the catalytic STT3 subunit points away from the center of the complex, allowing unhindered access to substrates. The dolichol-pyrophosphate moiety binds to a lipid-exposed groove of STT3, whereas two noncatalytic subunits and an ordered N-glycan form a membrane-proximal pocket for the oligosaccharide. The acceptor polypeptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> faces an oxidoreductase domain in stand-alone OST complexes or is immediately adjacent to the translocon, suggesting how eukaryotic OSTs efficiently glycosylate a large number of polypeptides before their folding.</p>

S1P-dependent interorgan trafficking of group 2 innate lymphoid cells supports host defense
<p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are innate counterparts of adaptive T lymphocytes, contributing to host defense, tissue repair, metabolic homeostasis, and inflammatory diseases. ILCs have been considered to be tissue-resident cells, but whether ILCs move between tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s during infection has been unclear. We show here that interleukin-25– or helminth-induced inflammatory ILC2s are circulating cells that arise from resting ILC2s residing in intestinal lamina propria. They migrate to diverse tissues based on sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)–mediated chemotaxis that promotes lymphatic entry, blood circulation, and accumulation in peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, including the lung, where they contribute to anti-helminth defense and tissue repair. This ILC2 expansion and migration is a behavioral parallel to the antigen-driven proliferation and migration of adaptive lymphocytes to effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and indicates that ILCs complement adaptive immunity by providing both local and distant tissue protection during infection.</p>

Reticulon 3–dependent ER-PM contact sites control EGFR nonclathrin endocytosis
<p>The integration of endocytic routes is critical to regulate receptor signaling. A nonclathrin endocytic (NCE) pathway of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is activated at high ligand concentrations and targets receptors to degradation, attenuating signaling. Here we performed an unbiased molecular characterization of EGFR-NCE. We identified NCE-specific regulators, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident protein reticulon 3 (RTN3) and a specific cargo, CD147. RTN3 was critical for EGFR/CD147-NCE, promoting the creation of plasma membrane (PM)–ER contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that were required for the formation and/or maturation of NCE invaginations.

Neandertal and Denisovan DNA from Pleistocene sediments

By combining x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we can identify and characterize the reactivity of each catalyst. Both experimental and theoretical results agree that ZnCu undergoes surface oxidation under the reaction conditions so that surface Zn transforms into ZnO and allows ZnCu to reach the activity of ZnO/Cu with the same Zn coverage. Our results highlight a synergy of Cu and ZnO at the interface that facilitates methanol synthesis via formate intermediates.</p>

Persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant domestication on Amazonian forest composition

Crystal structures of a group II intron lariat primed for reverse splicing
<p>The 2′-5′ branch of nuclear premessenger introns is believed to have been inherited from self-splicing group II introns, which are retrotransposons of bacterial origin. Our crystal structures at 3.4 and 3.5 angstrom of an excised group II intron in branched (“lariat”) form show that the 2′-5′ branch organizes a network of active-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> tertiary interactions that position the intron terminal 3′-hydroxyl group into a configuration poised to initiate reverse splicing, the first step in retrotransposition.

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the degradation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 degradation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from degradation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for degradation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the stability of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE

The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t CDK inhibitors, the INHIBITOR/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t-specific family of CDK inhibitors.</p>

Ribosomal RNA Biogenesis and Its Response to Chilling Stress in <i>Oryza sativa</i>
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth and environmental acclimation. Processing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) is an essential step in ribosome biogenesis and begins with transcription of the rDNA. The resulting precursor-rRNA (pre-rRNA) transcript undergoes systematic processing, where multiple endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavages remove the external and internal transcribed spacers (ETS and ITS). The processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and pathways for pre-rRNA processing have been deciphered in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and, to some extent, in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, mammalian cells, and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and pathways remain largely unknown in crops, particularly in monocots such as rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), one of the most important food resources in the world. Here, we identified the rRNA precursors produced during rRNA biogenesis and the critical endonucleolytic cleavage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in the transcribed spacer regions of pre-rRNAs in rice. We further found that two pre-rRNA processing pathways, distinguished by the order of 5′ ETS removal and ITS1 cleavage, coexist in vivo. Moreover, exposing rice to chilling stress resulted in the inhibition of rRNA biogenesis mainly at the pre-rRNA processing level, suggesting that these energy-intensive processes may be reduced to increase acclimation and survival at lower temperatures. Overall, our study identified the pre-rRNA processing pathway in rice and showed that ribosome biogenesis is quickly inhibited by low temperatures, which may shed light on the link between ribosome biogenesis and environmental acclimation in crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure.

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth and development, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral development. Negative feedback regulation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative regulators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs regulate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-binding motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for regulating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA feedback regulation. Mutations in four GAF1-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s abolished the negative feedback of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Our results showed that GAF1-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are necessary for GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>, suggesting that the DELLA-GAF1 complex is a main component of the GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-terminal domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a folded segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil fragment. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation. Based on these results, a model is proposed illustrating the role of the N-terminal domain of BnaDGAT1 as a positive and negative modulator of TAG biosynthesis.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Here, we perform in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Altering Pollen Soluble Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity<xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates and protein kinases involved is vital to understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate biological function in eukaryotic cells. Pyrophosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) to inorganic phosphate P<sub>i</sub>, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic phosphate. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family I soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two pollen-expressed sPPases, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, from the flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these pollen sPPases. Despite the absence of reports in the literature on mapping phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes identified a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p26.1a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2.5-fold at pH 6.8 and 52% in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events. As sPPases are essential for many metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells, our findings identify the phosphorylation of sPPases as a potential master regulatory mechanism that could be used to attenuate metabolism.</p>

The IQD Family of Calmodulin-Binding Proteins Links Calcium Signaling to Microtubules, Membrane Subdomains, and the Nucleus
<p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential processes for the coordination and control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t cell shape and cell growth. Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal sensors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t-specific IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-specific localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to specific subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s for precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-specific MT patterns, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell shape, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s to regulate cell function, shape, and growth.</p>

The α-Terpineol to 1,8-Cineole Cyclization Reaction of Tobacco Terpene Synthases
<p>Flowers of <i>Nicotiana</i> species emit a characteristic blend including the cineole cassette monoterpenes. This set of terpenes is synthesized by multiproduct enzymes, with either 1,8-cineole or α-terpineol contributing most to the volatile spectrum, thus referring to cineole or terpineol synthase, respectively. To understand the molecular and structural requirements of the enzymes that favor the biochemical formation of α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>-directed mutagenesis, in silico modeling, and semiempiric calculations were performed. Our results indicate the formation of α-terpineol by a nucleophilic attack of water. During this attack, the α-terpinyl cation is stabilized by π-stacking with a tryptophan side chain (tryptophan-253). The hypothesized catalytic mechanism of α-terpineol-to-1,8-cineole conversion is initiated by a catalytic dyad (histidine-502 and glutamate-249), acting as a base, and a threonine (threonine-278) providing the subsequent rearrangement from terpineol to cineol by catalyzing the autoprotonation of (<i>S</i>)-(−)-α-terpineol, which is the favored enantiomer product of the recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>-directed mutagenesis, we were able to identify amino acids at positions 147, 148, and 266 that determine the different terpineol-cineole ratios in <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>suaveolens</i> cineole synthase and <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>langsdorffii</i> terpineol synthase. Since amino acid 266 is more than 10 ÅÅ away from the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, an indirect effect of this amino acid exchange on the catalysis is discussed.</p>

Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> makes an independent contribution to fitness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the experimentally determined fitness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We tested this hypothesis by using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. Fitness effects ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal effects were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious effects ranged from near neutral (−26.7% reduction of fitness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different fitness effects in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in the human genome.</p>

Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme
<p>Embryos of medaka <i>Oryzias latipes</i> hatch in freshwater, while those of killifish <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> hatch in brackish water. Medaka and <i>Fundulus</i> possess two kinds of hatching enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), which cooperatively digest their egg envelope at the time of hatching. Optimal salinity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two <i>Fundulus</i> HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each salinity at the time of hatching. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope digestion in various salinities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> at position 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two enzymes. Superimposition of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that position 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that position 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with recognition of primary structure around the cleavage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, but with recognition of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein.</p>

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a regulated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial regulator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin focus that defines the fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. PI(4,5)P2 enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to actin remodeling. Regulators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin focus size and altered focus morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin focus are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin regulators at the fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. Moreover, improper localization of these regulators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at the fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> encodes spatial and temporal information that regulates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

Releasing the Brakes on the Fibrinolytic System in Pulmonary Emboli
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In patients with hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism, physiological fibrinolysis fails to dissolve thrombi acutely and r-tPA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) therapy may be required, despite its bleeding risk. To examine potential mechanisms, we analyzed the expression of key fibrinolytic molecules in experimental pulmonary emboli, assessed the contribution of α2-antiplasmin to fibrinolytic failure, and compared the effects of plasminogen activation and α2-antiplasmin inactivation on experimental thrombus dissolution and bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary embolism was induced by jugular vein infusion of <sup>125</sup>I-fibrin or fluorescein isothiocyanate-fibrin labeled emboli in anesthetized mice. Thrombus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> expression of key fibrinolytic molecules was determined by immunofluorescence staining. The effects of r-tPA and α2-antiplasmin inactivation on fibrinolysis and bleeding were examined in a humanized model of pulmonary embolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The plasminogen activation and plasmin inhibition system assembled at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> of acute pulmonary emboli in vivo. Thrombus dissolution was markedly accelerated in mice with normal α2-antiplasmin levels treated with an α2-antiplasmin–inactivating antibody (<i>P</i><0.0001). Dissolution of pulmonary emboli by α2-antiplasmin inactivation alone was comparable to 3 mg/kg r-tPA. Low-dose r-tPA alone did not dissolve emboli, but was synergistic with α2-antiplasmin inactivation, causing more embolus dissolution than clinical-dose r-tPA alone (<i>P</i><0.001) or α2-antiplasmin inactivation alone (<i>P</i><0.001). Despite greater thrombus dissolution, α2-antiplasmin inactivation alone, or in combination with low-dose r-tPA, did not lead to fibrinogen degradation, did not cause bleeding (versus controls), and caused less bleeding than clinical-dose r-tPA (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although the fibrinolytic system assembles at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> of pulmonary emboli, thrombus dissolution is halted by α2-antiplasmin. Inactivation of α2-antiplasmin was comparable to pharmacological r-tPA for dissolving thrombi. However, α2-antiplasmin inactivation showed a unique pattern of thrombus specificity, because unlike r-tPA, it did not degrade fibrinogen or enhance experimental bleeding. This suggests that modifying the activity of a key regulator of the fibrinolytic system, like α2-antiplasmin, may have unique therapeutic value in pulmonary embolism.</p></sec>

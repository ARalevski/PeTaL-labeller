A sleep-inducing gene, <i>nemuri</i>, links sleep and immune function in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>ains a major mystery of biology. In particular, little is known about the mechanisms that account for the drive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>. In an unbiased screen of more than 12,000 <i>Drosophila</i> lines, we identified a single gene, <i>nemuri</i>, that induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>. The NEMURI protein is an antimicrobial peptide that can be secreted ectopically to drive prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> (with resistance to arousal) and to promote survival after infection. Loss of <i>nemuri</i> increased arousability during daily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> and attenuated the acute increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> deprivation or bacterial infection. Conditions that increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> drive induced expression of <i>nemuri</i> in a small number of fly brain neurons and targeted it to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>-promoting, dorsal fan-shaped body. We propose that NEMURI is a bona fide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> homeostasis factor that is particularly important under conditions of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> need; because these conditions include sickness, our findings provide a link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> and immune function.</p>

The sleep-wake cycle regulates brain interstitial fluid tau in mice and CSF tau in humans
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>-wake cycle regulates interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) that accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> deprivation (SD) increases Aβ plaques. However, tau, not Aβ, accumulation appears to drive AD neurodegeneration. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding and spreading were influenced by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>-wake cycle and SD. Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90% during normal wakefulness versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> and ~100% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased more than 50% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-spreading model, chronic SD increased tau pathology spreading. Chemogenetically driven wakefulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF Aβ and tau. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>-wake cycle regulates ISF tau, and SD increases ISF and CSF tau as well as tau pathology spreading.</p>

Linking immunity and sickness-induced sleep
<p>We are all familiar with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>iness experienced during sickness. What is less often appreciated is that this increased need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> is caused by the release of signaling molecules by our own immune and nervous systems, and not by the infectious agents themselves (<i>1</i>). Indeed, for the spread of a virus or a bacterium, it would be much better if we were out and about when sick, instead of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>ing. On page 509 of this issue, Toda <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) reveal another facet of the interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> and immunity by identifying NEMURI (NUR), an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) produced by the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> that also has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>-promoting properties. Because humans synthesize more than 100 different AMPs (<i>3</i>), this work could have implications for interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> and immunity during human disease.</p>

Homer1a drives homeostatic scaling-down of excitatory synapses during sleep
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> is an essential process that supports learning and memory by acting on synapses through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Using biochemistry, proteomics, and imaging in mice, we find that during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>, synapses undergo widespread alterations in composition and signaling, including weakening of synapses through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>oval and dephosphorylation of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These changes are driven by the immediate early gene Homer1a and signaling from group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1/5. Homer1a serves as a molecular integrator of arousal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> need via the wake- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>-promoting neuromodulators, noradrenaline and adenosine, respectively. Our data suggest that homeostatic scaling-down, a global form of synaptic plasticity, is active during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>odel synapses and participates in the consolidation of contextual memory.</p>

ERK signaling pathway regulates sleep duration through activity-induced gene expression during wakefulness
<p>Wakefulness is accompanied by experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and an increase in activity-regulated gene transcription. Wake-induced genes are certainly markers of neuronal activity and may also directly regulate the duration of and need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>. We stimulated murine cortical cultures with the neuromodulatory signals that are known to control wakefulness in the brain and found that norepinephrine alone or a mixture of these neuromodulators induced activity-regulated gene transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of the various signaling pathways involved in the regulation of gene expression indicated that the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is the principal one mediating the effects of waking neuromodulators on gene expression. In mice, ERK phosphorylation in the cortex increased and decreased with wakefulness and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>. Whole-body or cortical neuron–specific deletion of <i>Erk1</i> or <i>Erk2</i> significantly increased the duration of wakefulness in mice, and pharmacological inhibition of ERK phosphorylation decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> duration and increased the duration of wakefulness bouts. Thus, this signaling pathway, which is highly conserved from <i>Drosophila</i> to mammals, is a key pathway that links waking experience–induced neuronal gene expression to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> duration and quality.</p>

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle
<p>It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals learn, and depression should occur during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>. We measured 6920 synapses in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses (~80%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.</p>

Making room for new memories
<p>What are our memories made of? Plato suggested imagining a block of wax in our soul, where perceptions and thoughts leave impressions that we can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>ember as long as they have not been erased. This historic metaphor captures the transience of some memories and the stability of others, and it illustrates the brain's plasticity. The mechanisms of memory formation and retention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>ain a key question in neuroscience. Groundbreaking work on the rodent hippocampus (a network in the temporal lobe) revealed that certain neurons form transiently stable representations of places (<i>1</i>). Hence, this brain region has become an important focus for studying spatial memory (or engram) formation. It also serves as an experimentally accessible proxy for declarative (knowledge) and episodic (experience) memory in humans, which involves the same brain structures and mechanisms. However, how can we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>ember an almost infinite number of items with the limited storage capacity of the hippocampus? There is good evidence that relevant representations are transferred to neocortical networks before forming long-lasting engrams. The hippocampus is then reset for acquisition of new memories. Studies in animals (<i>2</i>) and humans (<i>3</i>) show that neuronal activity during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> plays a major role in these processes. The underlying mechanisms, however, have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>ained mostly enigmatic. On page 1524 of this issue, Norimoto <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>-associated activity patterns induce “negative” neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, erasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>ote memories. A previous, related paper by Khodagholy <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) reveals similar activity patterns in the neocortex, which, hence, may mediate long-term consolidation of transient engrams at their final location.</p>

Learning-enhanced coupling between ripple oscillations in association cortices and hippocampus
<p>Consolidation of declarative memories requires hippocampal-neocortical communication. Although experimental evidence supports the role of sharp-wave ripples in transferring hippocampal information to the neocortex, the exact cortical destinations and the physiological mechanisms of such transfer are not known. We used a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to record local field potentials and neural spiking across the dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe recordings in the hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>, concurrent with hippocampal ripples. Coupling between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was strengthened during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> following learning. These findings suggest that ripple-ripple coupling supports hippocampal-association cortical transfer of memory traces.</p>

A global brain state underlies <i>C. elegans</i> sleep behavior
<p>How the brain effectively switches between and maintains global states, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> and wakefulness, is not yet understood. We used brainwide functional imaging at single-cell resolution to show that during the developmental stage of lethargus, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> brain is predisposed to global quiescence, characterized by systemic down-regulation of neuronal activity. Only a few specific neurons are exempt from this effect. In the absence of external arousing cues, this quiescent brain state arises by the convergence of neuronal activities toward a fixed-point attractor embedded in an otherwise dynamic neural state space. We observed efficient spontaneous and sensory-evoked exits from quiescence. Our data support the hypothesis that during global states such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>, neuronal networks are drawn to a baseline mode and can be effectively reactivated by signaling from arousing circuits.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex neuronal and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-based mechanisms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to rodents. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor neuron loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in neurons and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor neurons, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor neurons, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor neurons versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> fragmentation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested mechanism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor neurons and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular mechanisms, which will be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p>

Type 2 diabetes–associated variants of the MT<sub>2</sub> melatonin receptor affect distinct modes of signaling
<p>Melatonin is produced during the night and regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> and circadian rhythms. Loss-of-function variants in <i>MTNR1B</i>, which encodes the melatonin receptor MT<sub>2</sub>, a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To identify specific T2D-associated signaling pathway(s), we profiled the signaling output of 40 MT<sub>2</sub> variants by monitoring spontaneous (ligand-independent) and melatonin-induced activation of multiple signaling effectors. Genetic association analysis showed that defects in the melatonin-induced activation of Gα<sub>i1</sub> and Gα<sub>z</sub> proteins and in spontaneous β-arrestin2 recruitment to MT<sub>2</sub> were the most statistically significantly associated with an increased T2D risk. Computational variant impact prediction by in silico evolutionary lineage analysis strongly correlated with the measured phenotypic effect of each variant, providing a predictive tool for future studies on GPCR variants. Together, this large-scale functional study provides an operational framework for the postgenomic analysis of the multiple GPCR variants present in the human population. The association of T2D risk with signaling pathway–specific defects opens avenues for pathway-specific personalized therapeutic intervention and reveals the potential relevance of MT<sub>2</sub> function during the day, when melatonin is undetectable, but spontaneous activity of the receptor occurs.</p>

Evolutionary shift toward protein-based architecture in trypanosomal mitochondrial ribosomes

The trypanosomal mitoribosome features the smallest rRNAs and contains more proteins than all known ribosomes.

Our results also reveal the “minimal” set of conserved rRNA and protein components shared by all ribosomes that help us define the most essential functional elements.</p>

The paraventricular thalamus is a critical thalamic area for wakefulness

However, the specific nucleus and neural circuitry for this function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rem</span></strong>ain unknown. Using in vivo fiber photometry or multichannel electrophysiological recordings in mice, we found that glutamatergic neurons of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) exhibited high activities during wakefulness. Suppression of PVT neuronal activity caused a reduction in wakefulness, whereas activation of PVT neurons induced a transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong> to wakefulness and an acceleration of emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, our findings indicate that the PVT–nucleus accumbens projections and hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus to PVT glutamatergic neurons’ projections are the effector pathways for wakefulness control. These results demonstrate that the PVT is a key wakefulness-controlling nucleus in the thalamus.</p>

Ribosomes on the night shift
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, life involves two simple goals: survival and reproduction. But these goals are fundamentally at odds. Reproduction depends on growth, but attempts to grow when nutrients are scarce can jeopardize survival. In cells, growth is accomplished in large part by ribosomes, huge RNA-protein machines that translate nucleic acid messages into protein, the main biochemical constituent of cells. In nutrient-rich conditions, cells can be filled with ribosomes; they comprise more than a third of total biomass in rapidly growing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>1</i>). But what happens to ribosomes when nutrient levels decline, as occurs sporadically in microbes and nightly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sleep</span></strong>ing humans? Biosynthesis subsides, and ribosomes now serve as a reservoir of nutrients. Building on recent progress probing the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation from Gu <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Abu-Remaileh <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), on page 751 of this issue, Wyant <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) elucidate a pathway in which ribosomes are selectively digested, promoting survival in starved cells.</p>

Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses

We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-wave ripple oscillations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-wave ripples during slow-wave states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the learning of new memories. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-wave states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-wave ripples.</p>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940
<p>We estimated rates of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of children who earn more than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dream</span></strong>” of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.</p>

Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules
<p>It is still not possible to predict whether a given molecule will have a perceived odor or what olfactory percept it will produce. We therefore organized the crowd-sourced DREAM Olfaction Prediction Challenge. Using a large olfactory psychophysical data set, teams developed machine-learning algorithms to predict sensory attributes of molecules based on their chemoinformatic features. The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit. These models help to predict the perceptual qualities of virtually any molecule with high accuracy and also reverse-engineer the smell of a molecule.</p>

Eligibility also required either left atrial enlargement (≥4.4 cm or volume ≥58 mL) or increased (≥290 pg/mL) serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide). Patients were monitored for SCAF lasting ≥5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred fifty-six patients were followed up for 16.3±3.8 months. Baseline age was 74±6 years; mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 4.1±1.4; left atrial diameter averaged 4.7±0.8 cm; and 48% had a prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism. SCAF ≥5 minutes was detected in 90 patients (detection rate, 34.4%/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7–42.3). Baseline predictors of SCAF were increased age (hazard ratio [HR] per decade, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11–2.15), left atrial dimension (HR per centimeter diameter, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09–1.86), and blood pressure (HR per 10 mm Hg, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), but not prior stroke. The rate of occurrence of SCAF in those with a history of stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack was 39.4%/y versus 30.3%/y without (<i>P</i>=0.32). The cumulative SCAF detection rate was higher (51.9%/y) in those with left atrial volume above the median value of 73.5 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SCAF is frequently detected by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in older patients without a history of atrial fibrillation who are attending outpatient cardiology and neurology clinics. Its clinical significance is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. Unique identifier: NCT01694394.</p></sec>

Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns and doses of insulin
<p>Secretion of insulin transiently increases after eating, resulting in a high circulating concentration. Fasting limits insulin secretion, resulting in a low concentration of insulin in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional responses to different temporal patterns and doses of insulin in the hepatoma FAO cells and identified 13 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated and 16 down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated insulin-responsive genes (IRGs). The up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs responded more rapidly than did the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in insulin concentration, whereas the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs were repressed at lower concentrations of insulin than those required to stimulate the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs. Mathematical modeling of the insulin response as two stages—(i) insulin signaling to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability—indicated that the first stage was the more rapid stage for the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs, whereas the second stage of transcription was the more rapid stage for the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs. A subset of the IRGs that were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated or down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the FAO cells was similarly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of insulin. Thus, not only can cells respond to insulin but they can also interpret the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant insulin production or tissue responsiveness.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation) and (2) down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Thus, donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B radiation in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B radiation, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B radiation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B radiation, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator MYC2 was up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

Regulation of Sucrose Transporters and Phloem Loading in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>Suc transporters (SUTs) play a key role in the allocation and partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. While a function could be assigned to many members of the SUT family, almost no information is available on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Here, the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of SUTs in response to various environmental stimuli in the leaves of five dicots (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], soybean [<i>Glycine max</i>], potato [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>], tomato [<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i>], and poplar [<i>Populus</i> spp.]) and four monocots (maize [<i>Zea</i> <i>mays</i>], rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>], and barley [<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]) was investigated. Extensive data on expression of <i>SUT</i>s in relation to changes of environmental conditions were obtained through a global analysis of 168 transcriptomics data sets. Results were validated by quantitative PCR measurements and extended by the measurement of photosynthesis rate and phloem sugar content to draw insight on the correlation of <i>SUT</i> expression and sugar export from leaves. For the apoplasmic phloem loaders, a clear difference in transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation in response to different environmental stimuli was observed. The consistent patterns of <i>SUT</i> expression under abiotic stress indicates which types of SUTs are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of leaf sugar status and in stress signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of phloem loading is likely to be caused by transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of SUTs, while up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation depends on post-transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. In poplar, expression of <i>PtaSUT4</i> was found to consistently respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting a significant role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of sugar export from leaves in this passive symplasmic phloem loader.</p>

Type B Response Regulators Act As Central Integrators in Transcriptional Control of the Auxin Biosynthesis Enzyme TAA1
<p>During embryogenesis and organ formation, establishing proper gradient is critical for auxin function, which is achieved through coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of both auxin metabolism and transport. Expression of auxin biosynthetic genes is often tissue specific and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by environmental signals. However, the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of a key auxin biosynthetic gene, <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1 (<i>TAA1</i>). A canonical and a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator (ARR) binding site were identified in the promoter and the second intron of <i>TAA1</i>, which were required for its tissue-specific expression. C-termini of a subset of the type B ARRs selectively bind to one or both cis elements and activate the expression of <i>TAA1</i>. We further demonstrated that the ARRs not only mediate the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>TAA1</i> by cytokinins, but also mediate its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation by ethylene, light, and developmental signals. Through direct protein-protein interactions, the transcriptional activity of ARR1 is enhanced by ARR12, DELLAs, and ethylene-insenstive3 (EIN3). Our study thus revealed the ARR proteins act as key node that mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of auxin biosynthesis by various hormonal, environmental, and developmental signals through transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the key auxin biosynthesis gene <i>TAA1</i>.</p>

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate many aspects of plant growth and development, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral development. Negative feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-binding motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-binding sites exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic plants, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Mutations in four GAF1-binding sites abolished the negative feedback of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic plants. Our results showed that GAF1-binding sites are necessary for GA feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>, suggesting that the DELLA-GAF1 complex is a main component of the GA feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>.</p>

The BABY BOOM Transcription Factor Activates the LEC1-ABI3-FUS3-LEC2 Network to Induce Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>Somatic embryogenesis is an example of induced cellular totipotency, where embryos develop from vegetative cells rather than from gamete fusion. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators and/or stress treatments. The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2 transcription factors are key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of plant cell totipotency, as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings without exogenous growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators or stress treatments. Although LEC and BBM proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the same developmental process, it is not known whether they function in the same molecular pathway. We show that BBM transcriptionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates <i>LEC1</i> and <i>LEC2</i>, as well as the two other <i>LAFL</i> genes, <i>FUSCA3</i> (<i>FUS3</i>) and <i>ABSCISIC ACID</i> <i>INSENSITIVE3</i> (<i>ABI3</i>). LEC2 and ABI3 quantitatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis, while FUS3 and LEC1 are essential for this process. BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis is dose and context dependent, and the context-dependent phenotypes are associated with differential <i>LAFL</i> expression. We also uncover functional redundancy for somatic embryogenesis among other Arabidopsis BBM-like proteins and show that one of these proteins, PLETHORA2, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates <i>LAFL</i> gene expression. Our data place BBM upstream of other major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of plant embryo identity and totipotency.</p>

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA (SUF4) Supports Gamete Fusion via Regulating Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> Gene Expression
<p>The <i>EGG CELL1</i> (<i>EC1</i>) gene family of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) comprises five members that are specifically expressed in the egg cell and redundantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> gamete fusion during double fertilization.

In particular, we demonstrated that SUF4 binds to all five Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> promoters, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating their expression. The down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>SUF4</i> in homozygous <i>suf4-1</i> ovules results in reduced <i>EC1</i> expression and delayed sperm fusion, which can be rescued by expressing SUF4-β-glucuronidase under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the <i>SUF4</i> promoter. To identify more gene products able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>EC1</i> expression together with SUF4, we performed coexpression studies that led to the identification of <i>MOM1</i> (<i>MORPHEUS’ MOLECULE1</i>), a component of a silencing mechanism that is independent of DNA methylation marks. In <i>mom1-3</i> ovules, both <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> genes are down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, and <i>EC1</i> genes show higher levels of histone 3 lysine-9 acetylation, suggesting that MOM1 contributes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> gene expression.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s the activity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the transporter and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif.

Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity.

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time

ANAC017 Coordinates Organellar Functions and Stress Responses by Reprogramming Retrograde Signaling
<p>Mitochondria adjust their activities in response to external and internal stimuli to optimize growth via the mitochondrial retrograde response signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NAC domain transcription factor ANAC017 has previously been identified as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of the mitochondrial retrograde response. We show here that overexpression of <i>ANAC017</i> in Arabidopsis leads to growth retardation, altered leaf development with decreased cell size and viability, and early leaf senescence. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that increased <i>ANAC017</i> expression leads to higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial stress, cell death/autophagy, and leaf senescence under nonlimiting growth conditions as well as extensive repression of chloroplast function. Gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory network analysis indicated that a complex hierarchy of transcription factors exists downstream of ANAC017. These involve a set of up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated ANAC and WRKY transcription factors associated with organellar signaling and senescence. The network also includes a number of ethylene- and gibberellic acid-related transcription factors with established functions in stress responses and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, which down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate their target genes.

Our results show that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane tethering of the constitutively expressed ANAC017, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led release, are crucial to fine-tune a fast reactive but potentially harmful signaling cascade. Thus, ANAC017 is a master <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of cellular responses with mitochondria acting as central sensors.</p>

Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, while genes related to autophagy were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

Two B-Box Proteins Regulate Photomorphogenesis by Oppositely Modulating HY5 through their Diverse C-Terminal Domains
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BBX family comprises several positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of photomorphogenesis. BBX24, a member of BBX structural group IV, acts as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of photomorphogenesis, whereas another member from the same group, BBX21, is a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator. The molecular basis for the functional diversity shown by these related BBX family members is unknown. Using domain-swap lines, we show that the C-terminal regions of BBX24 and BBX21 specify their function. Because both BBX21 and BBX24 work in close association with HY5, we hypothesized that these proteins differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the levels or activity of HY5 to fulfill their opposite roles. We show that BBX21 can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate HY5 post-transcriptionally and the two proteins can coordinate to promote photomorphogenesis. By contrast, BBX24 interferes with the binding of HY5 to the promoter of an anthocyanin biosynthetic gene, possibly by heterodimerizing with HY5 and preventing it from binding DNA. Our finding that both BBX21 and BBX24 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate HY5 activity post-transcriptionally, in opposite ways, suggests that closely related B-box proteins execute contrasting functions through differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of HY5.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture.

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of ABA homeostasis through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> point in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity
<p>Plants are exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, and their ability to respond to environmental variation depends on the proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of gene expression in an organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific manner. Although our knowledge of how stress responses are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated is accumulating, a genome-wide model of how plant transcription factors (TFs) and cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory elements <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> spatially specific stress response has yet to emerge. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-salinity (salt) up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes in the root or the shoot. We used these pCREs to develop computational models that can better predict salt up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes in the root and shoot compared with models based on known TF binding motifs. In addition, we incorporated TF binding sites identified via large-scale in vitro assays, chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation, and pCRE combinatorial relationships in machine learning models and found that only consideration of pCRE combinations led to better performance in salt up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation prediction in the root and shoot. Our results suggest that the plant organ transcriptional response to high salinity is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by a core set of pCREs and provide a genome-wide view of the cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory code of plant spatial transcriptional responses to environmental stress.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant resistance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate resistance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to resistance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, ABA still induces resistance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant resistance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV resistance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated resistance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation partially contributes to ABA-mediated resistance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

Light Controls Cytokinin Signaling via Transcriptional Regulation of Constitutively Active Sensor Histidine Kinase CKI1
<p>In plants, the multistep phosphorelay (MSP) pathway mediates a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory processes, including those activated by cytokinins. The cross talk between cytokinin response and light has been known for a long time. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between light and cytokinin signaling remains elusive. In the screen for upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators we identified a <i>LONG PALE HYPOCOTYL</i> (<i>LPH</i>) gene whose activity is indispensable for spatiotemporally correct expression of <i>CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1</i> (<i>CKI1</i>), encoding the constitutively active sensor His kinase that activates MSP signaling. <i>lph</i> is a new allele of <i>HEME OXYGENASE1</i> (<i>HY1</i>) that encodes the key protein in the biosynthesis of phytochromobilin, a cofactor of photoconvertible phytochromes. Our analysis confirmed the light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the <i>CKI1</i> expression pattern. We show that <i>CKI1</i> expression is under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of phytochrome A (phyA), functioning as a dual (both positive and negative) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of <i>CKI1</i> expression, presumably via the phyA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated transcription factors (TF) PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1. Changes in <i>CKI1</i> expression observed in <i>lph</i>/<i>hy1</i>-<i>7</i> and <i>phy</i> mutants correlate with mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of MSP signaling, changed cytokinin sensitivity, and developmental aberrations that were previously shown to be associated with cytokinin and/or CKI1 action. Besides that, we demonstrate a novel role of phyA-dependent <i>CKI1</i> expression in the hypocotyl elongation and hook development during skotomorphogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that the light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>CKI1</i> provides a plausible mechanistic link underlying the well-known interaction between light- and cytokinin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led plant development.</p>

The Transcription Factor MYB29 Is a Regulator of <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i>
<p>Plants sense and integrate a variety of signals from the environment through different interacting signal transduction pathways that involve hormones and signaling molecules. Using <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i> (<i>AOX1a</i>) gene expression as a model system of retrograde or stress signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN29 (MYB29) was identified as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of alternative oxidase1a 7</i> [<i>rao7</i>] mutant) in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>rao7/myb29</i> mutants have increased levels of AOX1a transcript and protein compared to wild type after induction with antimycin A. A variety of genes previously associated with the mitochondrial stress response also display enhanced transcript abundance, indicating that RAO7/MYB29 negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates mitochondrial stress responses in general. Meta-analysis of hormone-responsive marker genes and identification of downstream transcription factor networks revealed that MYB29 functions in the complex interplay of ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and reactive oxygen species signaling by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the expression of various ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR and WRKY transcription factors. Despite an enhanced induction of mitochondrial stress response genes, <i>rao7</i>/<i>myb29</i> mutants displayed an increased sensitivity to combined moderate light and drought stress.

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating interactions with the environment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

The RNA-binding protein ELAV regulates Hox RNA processing, expression and function within the <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated head-to-tail expression of Hox genes provides a coordinate system for the activation of specific programmes of cell differentiation according to axial level. Recent work indicates that Hox expression can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated via RNA processing but the underlying mechanisms and biological significance of this form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation remain poorly understood. Here we explore these issues within the developing <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system (CNS). We show that the pan-neural RNA-binding protein (RBP) ELAV (Hu antigen) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the RNA processing patterns of the Hox gene <i>Ultrabithorax</i> (<i>Ubx</i>) within the embryonic CNS. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic and imaging approaches we demonstrate that ELAV binds to discrete elements within <i>Ubx</i> RNAs and that its genetic removal reduces Ubx protein expression in the CNS leading to the respecification of cellular subroutines under <i>Ubx</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, thus defining for the first time a specific cellular role of ELAV within the developing CNS. Artificial provision of ELAV in glial cells (a cell type that lacks ELAV) promotes Ubx expression, suggesting that ELAV-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation might contribute to cell type-specific Hox expression patterns within the CNS. Finally, we note that expression of <i>abdominal A</i> and <i>Abdominal B</i> is reduced in <i>elav</i> mutant embryos, whereas other Hox genes (<i>Antennapedia</i>) are not affected. Based on these results and the evolutionary conservation of ELAV and Hox genes we propose that the modulation of Hox RNA processing by ELAV serves to adapt the morphogenesis of the CNS to axial level by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating Hox expression and consequently activating local programmes of neural differentiation.</p>

Locally translated mTOR controls axonal local translation in nerve injury
<p>How is protein synthesis initiated locally in neurons? We found that mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) was activated and then up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in injured axons, owing to local translation of mTOR messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA was transported into axons by the cell size–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating RNA-binding protein nucleolin. Furthermore, mTOR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led local translation in injured axons. This included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of its own translation and that of retrograde injury signaling molecules such as importin β1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Deletion of the mTOR 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in mice reduced mTOR in axons and decreased local translation after nerve injury. Both pharmacological inhibition of mTOR in axons and deletion of the mTOR 3′UTR decreased proprioceptive neuronal survival after nerve injury. Thus, mRNA localization enables spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of mTOR pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating local translation and long-range intracellular signaling.</p>

CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6: A Key Regulator of Na<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis during Germination
<p>Salinity impairs seed germination and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in salinity stress responses during early germination. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During germination, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the salt tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without salt treatment revealed 1,020 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated and 1,467 down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated salt-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated and 1,242 down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known salt stress-associated genes, including <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the salt-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site. We suggest that CAMTA6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates, directly or indirectly, the expression of most of the salt-responsive genes in germinating seeds, including genes that are crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and salt stress tolerance.</p>

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) floral scent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator ODORANT1 (ODO1), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s the exclusive production of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate petunia scent biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, promoter-activation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling <i>TRANSKETOLASE2</i> expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory modules exist in other plants and act to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>

The R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor MYB49 Regulates Cadmium Accumulation
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) reduces accumulation of potentially toxic cadmium (Cd) in plants. How the ABA signal is transmitted to modulate Cd uptake remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the basic region/Leu zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a central ABA signaling molecule, is involved in ABA-repressed Cd accumulation in plants by physically interacting with a previously uncharacterized R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB49. Overexpression of the Cd-induced <i>MYB49</i> gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) resulted in a significant increase in Cd accumulation, whereas <i>myb49</i> knockout plants and plants expressing chimeric repressors of <i>MYB49</i>:ERF-associated amphiphilic repression motif repression domain (<i>SRDX49</i>) exhibited reduced accumulation of Cd. Further investigations revealed that MYB49 positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i> and <i>bHLH101</i> by directly binding to their promoters, leading to activation of <i>IRON-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ATED TRANSPORTER1</i>, which encodes a metal transporter involved in Cd uptake. MYB49 also binds to the promoter regions of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (<i>HIPP22</i>) and <i>HIPP44</i>, resulting in up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of their expression and subsequent Cd accumulation. On the other hand, as a feedback mechanism to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> Cd uptake and accumulation in plant cells, Cd-induced ABA up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the expression of <i>ABI5</i>, whose protein product interacts with MYB49 and prevents its binding to the promoters of downstream genes, thereby reducing Cd accumulation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular feedback mechanisms underlying ABA signaling-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led Cd uptake and accumulation in plants.</p>

B-Box Containing Proteins BBX30 and BBX31, Acting Downstream of HY5, Negatively Regulate Photomorphogenesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Light-mediated seedling development is coordinately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by a variety of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators. Here, we identified two B-box (BBX)-containing proteins, BBX30 and BBX31, as repressors of photomorphogenesis. ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5, a central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of light signaling, directly binds to the <i>G-box cis-</i>element present in the promoters of <i>BBX30</i> and <i>BBX31</i> and negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s their transcription levels in the light. Seedlings with mutations in <i>BBX30</i> or <i>BBX31</i> are hypersensitive to light, whereas the overexpression of <i>BBX30</i> or <i>BBX31</i> leads to hypo-photomorphogenic growth in the light. Furthermore, transgenic and phenotypic analysis revealed that the B-box domain of BBX30 or BBX31 is essential for their respective functioning in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of photomorphogenic development in plants. In conclusion, BBX30 and BBX31 act as key negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of light signaling, and their transcription is repressed by ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 through directly associating with their promoters.</p>

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective maintenance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators are altered and down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche maintenance in Arabidopsis.</p>

Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant growth and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phytohormones, especially in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA promotes the accumulation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate AsA biosynthesis via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, <i>ABI4</i> is transcriptionally repressed by EIN3 in ethylene-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated AsA biosynthesis. Via transcriptome analysis and molecular and genetic experiments, we identified <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i>as the direct target of ABI4 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of AsA biosynthesis and ROS accumulation. Thus, the EIN3-ABI4- <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i> transcriptional cascade involves a mechanism by which ethylene and ABA antagonistically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate AsA biosynthesis and ROS accumulation in response to complex environmental stimuli.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis
<p><i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce plant defenses and modulate plant growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on plant growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of plant growth and modulation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated plant growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation during its interaction with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of plant-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Importin β4 Mediates Nuclear Import of GRF-Interacting Factors to Control Ovule Development in Arabidopsis

After their synthesis, TFs are transported into the nucleus a process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by karyopherins commonly known as importin alpha and β. Around half of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) importin β-coding genes have been functionally characterized but only two with specific cargos have been identified.

Mutations in <i>IMB4</i> impaired ovule development by affecting integument growth. <i>imb4</i> mutants were also defective in embryo sac development, leading to partial female sterility. IMB4 directly interacts with GIFs and is critical for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of GIF1. Finally, functional loss of <i>GIF</i>s resulted in ovule defects similar to those in <i>imb4</i> mutants, whereas enhanced expression of <i>GIF1</i> partially restored the fertility of <i>imb4</i>.

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>lers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including phytochrome. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf acts as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many auxin-responsive genes, suggesting that various physiological/developmental processes might be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was irradiated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was irradiated with far-red light. Most of the auxin-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local irradiation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain position in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be irradiated. This result was consistent with a previous report that auxin synthesis genes are up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, auxin acts as an important intraorgan signaling factor that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful fertilization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther opening (dehiscence), results in male sterility, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and fertility. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and fertility rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther opening.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

A PIF1/PIF3-HY5-BBX23 Transcription Factor Cascade Affects Photomorphogenesis
<p>Light signaling plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling higher plants’ early developmental process termed as photomorphogenesis. Transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation is a vital mechanism that is orchestrated by transcription factors and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory proteins working in concert to finely tune gene expression. Although many transcription factors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators have been characterized in the light-signaling pathway, their inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and PIF1 transcription factors directly bind to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory regions of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and a B-box gene BBX23 and activate their expression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that BBX23 and its close homolog gene BBX22 play a redundant role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating hypocotyl growth, and that plants overexpressing BBX23 display reduced hypocotyl elongation under red, far-red, and blue light conditions. Intriguingly, BBX23 transcription is inhibited by light, whereas its protein is degraded in darkness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HY5 physically interacts with BBX23, and these two proteins coordinately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the expression of both light-induced and light-repressed genes. BBX23 is also recruited to the promoter sequences of the light-responsive genes in a partial HY5-dependent manner. Taken together, our study reveals that the transcriptional cascade consisting of PIF1/PIF3, HY5, and BBX23 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s photomorphogenesis, providing a transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory layer by which plants fine-tune their growth in response to changing light environment.</p>

Brassinosteroid Biosynthesis Is Modulated via a Transcription Factor Cascade of COG1, PIF4, and PIF5
<p>Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential phytohormones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating various developmental and physiological processes during normal growth and development. <i>cog1-3D</i> (<i>cogwheel1-3D</i>) was identified as an activation-tagged genetic modifier of <i>bri1-5</i>, an intermediate BR receptor mutant in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>COG1</i> encodes a Dof-type transcription factor found previously to act as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of the phytochrome signaling pathway. <i>cog1-3D</i> single mutants show an elongated hypocotyl phenotype under light conditions. A loss-of-function mutant or inducible expression of a dominant negative form of <i>COG1</i> in the wild type results in an opposite phenotype. A BR profile assay indicated that BR levels are elevated in <i>cog1-3D</i> seedlings. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that several key BR biosynthetic genes are significantly up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in <i>cog1-3D</i> compared with those of the wild type. Two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>, were found to be transcriptionally up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in <i>cog1-3D</i>. Genetic analysis indicated that PIF4 and PIF5 were required for COG1 to promote BR biosynthesis and hypocotyl elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that COG1 binds to the promoter regions of <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>, and PIF4 and PIF5 bind to the promoter regions of key BR biosynthetic genes, such as <i>DWF4</i> and <i>BR6ox2</i>, to directly promote their expression. These results demonstrated that COG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates BR biosynthesis via up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the transcription of <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>.</p>

Phosphorylation of SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE by the MPK3/6 Kinase Is Required for Anther Development
<p>Germ cells are indispensable carriers of genetic information from one generation to the next. In contrast to the well-understood process in animals, information on the mechanism of germ cell initiation in plants is very limited. <i>SPOROCYTELESS</i>/<i>NOZZLE</i> was previously identified as an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of diploid germ cell (archesporial cell) differentiation in the stamens and ovules of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Although <i>SPOROCYTELESS</i> (<i>SPL</i>) transcription is activated by the floral organ identity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator AGAMOUS and epigenetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by SET DOMAIN GROUP2, little is known about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the SPL protein. Here, we report that the protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6 can both interact with SPL in vitro and in vivo and can phosphorylate the SPL protein in vitro. In addition, phosphorylation of the SPL protein by MPK3/6 is required for SPL function in the Arabidopsis anther, as measured by its effect on archesporial cell differentiation. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation enhances SPL protein stability. This work not only uncovers the importance of SPL phosphorylation for its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory role in Arabidopsis anther development, but also supports the hypothesis that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of precise spatiotemporal patterning of germ cell initiation and that differentiation is achieved progressively through multiple levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, including transcriptional and posttranslational modification.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat, represents an essential sealing component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed coat. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed coat suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed coat permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator for seed coat suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

A Flowering Locus C Homolog Is a Vernalization-Regulated Repressor in <i>Brachypodium</i> and Is Cold Regulated in Wheat
<p>Winter cereals require prolonged cold to transition from vegetative to reproductive development. This process, referred to as vernalization, has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In Arabidopsis, a key flowering repressor called <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) quantitatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s the vernalization requirement. By contrast, in cereals, the vernalization response is mainly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by the <i>VERNALIZATION</i> genes, <i>VRN1</i> and <i>VRN2</i>. Here, we characterize <i>ODDSOC2</i>, a recently identified <i>FLC</i> ortholog in monocots, knowing that it belongs to the <i>FLC</i> lineage. By studying its expression in a diverse set of <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions, we find that it is a good predictor of the vernalization requirement. Analyses of transgenics demonstrated that <i>BdODDSOC2</i> functions as a vernalization-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated flowering repressor. In most <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions <i>BdODDSOC2</i> is down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by cold, and in one of the winter accessions in which this down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation was evident, <i>BdODDSOC2</i> responded to cold before <i>BdVRN1.</i> When stably down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, the mechanism is associated with spreading H3K27me3 modifications at the <i>BdODDSOC2</i> chromatin. Finally, homoeolog-specific gene expression analyses identify <i>TaAGL33</i> and its splice variant <i>TaAGL22</i> as the <i>FLC</i> orthologs in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) behaving most similar to <i>Brachypodium ODDSOC2</i>. Overall, our study suggests that <i>ODDSOC2</i> is not only phylogenetically related to <i>FLC</i> in eudicots but also functions as a flowering repressor in the vernalization pathway of <i>Brachypodium</i> and likely other temperate grasses. These insights could prove useful in breeding efforts to refine the vernalization requirement of temperate cereals and adapt varieties to changing climates.</p>

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin focus that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2 enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to actin remodeling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin focus size and altered focus morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin focus are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate vasoactivity and blood pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of blood pressure.</p></sec>

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine. Higher platelet PCTP expression is associated with increased platelet responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 thrombin receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects. Little is known about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of platelet <i>PCTP</i>. Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet responses on activation. Platelet expression profiling of a patient with a <i>RUNX1</i> loss-of-function mutation revealed a 10-fold down<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the <i>PCTP</i> gene compared with healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We pursued the hypothesis that <i>PCTP</i> is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by RUNX1 and that <i>PCTP</i> expression is correlated with cardiovascular events. We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies. We assessed the relationship between <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>PCTP</i> in peripheral blood RNA and <i>PCTP</i> and death or myocardial infarction in 2 separate patient cohorts (587 total patients) with cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Platelet PCTP protein in the patient was reduced by ≈50%. DNA-protein binding studies showed RUNX1 binding to consensus sites in ≈1 kB of <i>PCTP</i> promoter. <i>PCTP</i> expression was increased with <i>RUNX1</i> overexpression and reduced with <i>RUNX1</i> knockdown in human erythroleukemia cells, indicating that <i>PCTP</i> is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by RUNX1.

Distinct Regulatory Effects of Myeloid Cell and Endothelial Cell NAPDH Oxidase 2 on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertension caused by increased renin-angiotensin system activation is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production. Previous studies implicate NADPH oxidase (Nox) proteins as important reactive oxygen species sources during renin-angiotensin system activation, with different Nox isoforms being potentially involved. Among these, Nox2 is expressed in multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and microglia. Blood pressure (BP) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated at the central nervous system, renal, and vascular levels, but the cell-specific role of Nox2 in BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We generated a novel mouse model with a floxed Nox2 gene and used Tie2-Cre, LysM Cre, or Cdh5-CreERT2 driver lines to develop cell-specific models of Nox2 perturbation to investigate its role in BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Unexpectedly, Nox2 deletion in myeloid but not endothelial cells resulted in a significant reduction in basal BP.

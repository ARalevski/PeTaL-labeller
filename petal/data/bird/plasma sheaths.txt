Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Torsional instability in the single-chain limit of a transition metal trichalcogenide
<p>The scientific bounty resulting from the successful isolation of few to single layers of two-dimensional materials suggests that related new physics resides in the few- to single-chain limit of one-dimensional materials. We report the synthesis of the quasi–one-dimensional transition metal trichalcogenide NbSe<sub>3</sub> (niobium triselenide) in the few-chain limit, including the realization of isolated single chains. The chains are encapsulated in protective boron nitride or carbon nanotube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>s to prevent oxidation and to facilitate characterization. Transmission electron microscopy reveals static and dynamic structural torsional waves not found in bulk NbSe<sub>3</sub> crystals. Electronic structure calculations indicate that charge transfer drives the torsional wave instability. Very little covalent bonding is found between the chains and the nanotube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>, leading to relatively unhindered longitudinal and torsional dynamics for the encapsulated chains.</p>

Cholesterol crystals impede nerve repair
<p>Damage to the myelin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> that surrounds nerve axons represents the pathological hallmark of the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) and is thought to contribute to a number of other nervous system maladies (<i>1</i>). Remyelination, a regenerative process that forms new myelin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>s around demyelinated axons, restores nerve function and reverses the clinical manifestations associated with demyelination (<i>2</i>). Although remyelination occurs efficiently in young individuals, this restorative process proceeds less well with age (<i>2</i>). Inefficient remyelination results in axonal loss and progressive worsening of neurological symptoms. On page 684 of this issue, Cantuti-Castelvetri <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that insufficient clearance (phagocytosis) of damaged myelin by aged macrophages results in the accumulation of cholesterol crystals in these cells, which elicits a maladaptive inflammatory response that is associated with impaired remyelination. Understanding this process may reveal new therapeutic opportunities for MS and other demyelinating disorders.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>s, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>s—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot development, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem development, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally develop from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall development in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the developing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to develop secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary development in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary development for axillary meristem development. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch development by acting as a boundary gene during ligule development but not during lateral branch development.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>s, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

The Rubisco Chaperone BSD2 May Regulate Chloroplast Coverage in Maize Bundle Sheath Cells
<p>In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), Bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> Defective2 (BSD2) plays an essential role in Rubisco biogenesis and is required for correct bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> (BS) cell differentiation. Yet, BSD2 RNA and protein levels are similar in mesophyll (M) and BS chloroplasts, although Rubisco accumulates only in BS chloroplasts. This raises the possibility of additional BSD2 roles in cell development. To test this hypothesis, transgenic lines were created that overexpress and underexpress BSD2 in both BS and M cells, driven by the cell type-specific Rubisco Small Subunit (RBCS) or Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC) promoters or the ubiquitin promoter. Genetic crosses showed that each of the transgenes could complement Rubisco deficiency and seedling lethality conferred by the <i>bsd2</i> mutation. This was unexpected, as RBCS-BSD2 lines lacked BSD2 in M chloroplasts and PEPC-BSD2 lines expressed half the wild-type BSD2 level in BS chloroplasts. We conclude that BSD2 does not play a vital role in M cells and that BS BSD2 is in excess of requirements for Rubisco accumulation. BSD2 levels did affect chloroplast coverage in BS cells. In PEPC-BSD2 lines, chloroplast coverage decreased 30% to 50%, whereas lines with increased BSD2 content exhibited a 25% increase. This suggests that BSD2 has an ancillary role in BS cells related to chloroplast size. Gas exchange showed decreased photosynthetic rates in PEPC-BSD2 lines despite restored Rubisco function, correlating with reduced chloroplast coverage and pointing to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion changes. Conversely, increased chloroplast coverage did not result in increased Rubisco abundance or photosynthetic rates. This suggests another limitation beyond chloroplast volume, most likely Rubisco biogenesis and/or turnover rates.</p>

Photosynthetic Trichomes Contain a Specific Rubisco with a Modified pH-Dependent Activity
<p>Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is the most abundant enzyme in plants and is responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation during photosynthesis. This enzyme is assembled from eight large subunits (RbcL) encoded by a single chloroplast gene and eight small subunits (RbcS) encoded by a nuclear gene family. Rubisco is primarily found in the chloroplasts of mesophyll (C3 plants), bundle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> (C4 plants), and guard cells. In certain species, photosynthesis also takes place in the secretory cells of glandular trichomes, which are epidermal outgrowths (hairs) involved in the secretion of specialized metabolites. However, photosynthesis and, in particular, Rubisco have not been characterized in trichomes. Here, we show that tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) trichomes contain a specific Rubisco small subunit, NtRbcS-T, which belongs to an uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster (T). This cluster contains RbcS from at least 33 species, including monocots, many of which are known to possess glandular trichomes. Cluster T is distinct from the cluster M, which includes the abundant, functionally characterized RbcS isoforms expressed in mesophyll or bundle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> cells. Expression of NtRbcS-T in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and purification of the full Rubisco complex showed that this isoform conferred higher <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values as well as higher acidic pH-dependent activity than NtRbcS-M, an isoform expressed in the mesophyll. This observation was confirmed with trichome extracts. These data show that an ancient divergence allowed for the emergence of a so-far-uncharacterized RbcS cluster. We propose that secretory trichomes have a particular Rubisco uniquely adapted to secretory cells where CO<sub>2</sub> is released by the active specialized metabolism.</p>

Plant RuBisCo assembly in <i>E. coli</i> with five chloroplast chaperones including BSD2
<p>Plant RuBisCo, a complex of eight large and eight small subunits, catalyzes the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis. The low catalytic efficiency of RuBisCo provides strong motivation to reengineer the enzyme with the goal of increasing crop yields. However, genetic manipulation has been hampered by the failure to express plant RuBisCo in a bacterial host. We achieved the functional expression of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> RuBisCo in <i>Escherichia coli</i> by coexpressing multiple chloroplast chaperones. These include the chaperonins Cpn60/Cpn20, RuBisCo accumulation factors 1 and 2, RbcX, and bundle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> defective-2 (BSD2). Our structural and functional analysis revealed the role of BSD2 in stabilizing an end-state assembly intermediate of eight RuBisCo large subunits until the small subunits become available. The ability to produce plant RuBisCo recombinantly will facilitate efforts to improve the enzyme through mutagenesis.</p>

In situ architecture, function, and evolution of a contractile injection system
<p>Contractile injection systems mediate bacterial cell-cell interactions by a bacteriophage tail–like structure. In contrast to extracellular systems, the type 6 secretion system (T6SS) is defined by intracellular localization and attachment to the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we used cryo-focused ion beam milling, electron cryotomography, and functional assays to study a T6SS in <i>Amoebophilus asiaticus</i>. The in situ architecture revealed three modules, including a contractile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>-tube, a baseplate, and an anchor. All modules showed conformational changes upon firing. Lateral baseplate interactions coordinated T6SSs in hexagonal arrays. The system mediated interactions with host membranes and may participate in phagosome escape. Evolutionary sequence analyses predicted that T6SSs are more widespread than previously thought. Our insights form the basis for understanding T6SS key concepts and exploring T6SS diversity.</p>

Estimating Mesophyll Conductance from Measurements of C<sup>18</sup>OO Photosynthetic Discrimination and Carbonic Anhydrase Activity
<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in leaves catalyzes the <sup>18</sup>O exchange between CO<sub>2</sub> and water during photosynthesis. This feature has been used to estimate the mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i><sub>m</sub>) from measurements of online C<sup>18</sup>OO photosynthetic discrimination (<sup>18</sup>O). Based on CA assays on leaf extracts, it has been argued that CO<sub>2</sub> in mesophyll cells should be in isotopic equilibrium with water in most C<sub>3</sub> species as well as many C<sub>4</sub> dicot species. However, this seems incompatible with <sup>18</sup>O data that would indicate a much lower degree of equilibration, especially in C<sub>4</sub> plants under high light intensity. This apparent contradiction is resolved here using a new model of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic discrimination that includes competition between CO<sub>2</sub> hydration and carboxylation and the contribution of respiratory fluxes. This new modeling framework is used to revisit previously published data sets on C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, including CA-deficient plants. We conclude that (1) newly <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> values are usually close but significantly higher (typically 20% and up to 50%) than those derived assuming full equilibration and (2) despite the uncertainty associated with the respiration rate in light, or the water isotope gradient between mesophyll and bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> cells, robust estimates of <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> can be achieved in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p>

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and distribution to different organs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in rice. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the concentrations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>s of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu concentration in older leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the rice heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed yeast cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the redistribution of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in rice.</p>

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific variation of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural variation in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Variable traits include bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant variation. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative variation than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that variation in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than photosynthesis. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural variation within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated positioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal position and in more distant positions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the positioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

A Mucin-Like Protein of Planthopper Is Required for Feeding and Induces Immunity Response in Plants
<p>The brown planthopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>, is a pest that threatens rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. While feeding on rice plants, planthoppers secrete saliva, which plays crucial roles in nutrient ingestion and modulating plant defense responses, although the specific functions of salivary proteins remain largely unknown. We identified an <i>N. lugens</i>-secreted mucin-like protein (NlMLP) by transcriptome and proteome analyses and characterized its function, both in brown planthopper and in plants. <i>NlMLP</i> is highly expressed in salivary glands and is secreted into rice during feeding. Inhibition of <i>NlMLP</i> expression in planthoppers disturbs the formation of salivary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>s, thereby reducing their performance. In plants, NlMLP induces cell death, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition. These defense responses are related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the MEK2 MAP kinase and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. The active region of NlMLP that elicits plant responses is located in its carboxyl terminus. Our work provides a detailed characterization of a salivary protein from a piercing-sucking insect other than aphids. Our finding that the protein functions in plant immune responses offers new insights into the mechanism underlying interactions between plants and herbivorous insects.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several transporters involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong>. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

Identification of a Second Site of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Biosynthesis in Comfrey to Boost Plant Defense in Floral Stage<sup>,</sup>
<p>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are toxic secondary metabolites that are found in several distantly related families of the angiosperms. The first specific step in PA biosynthesis is catalyzed by homospermidine synthase (HSS), which has been recruited several times independently by duplication of the gene encoding deoxyhypusine synthase, an enzyme involved in the posttranslational activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A. HSS shows highly diverse spatiotemporal gene expression in various PA-producing species. In comfrey (<i>Symphytum officinale</i>; Boraginaceae), PAs are reported to be synthesized in the roots, with HSS being localized in cells of the root endodermis. Here, we show that comfrey plants activate a second site of HSS expression when inflorescences start to develop. HSS has been localized in the bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> cells of specific leaves. Tracer feeding experiments have confirmed that these young leaves express not only HSS but the whole PA biosynthetic route. This second site of PA biosynthesis results in drastically increased PA levels within the inflorescences. The boost of PA biosynthesis is proposed to guarantee optimal protection especially of the reproductive structures.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sheath</span></strong> provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are recognized. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> that may affect the risk for arrhythmias. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> than in men. However, because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> with AF exceeds that of men. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in comparison with men. Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is an independent risk factor for death or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention has similar efficacy for men and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>, but older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in comparison with men. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> with AF are less likely to receive rhythm control antiarrhythmic drug therapy, electric cardioversion, or catheter ablation in comparison with men. The incidence and prevalence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are lower in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> than in men. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death are less likely to experience sustained ventricular arrhythmias in comparison with men. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillator for the treatment of heart failure are more likely to benefit than men. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> are less likely to be referred for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy despite current guideline recommendations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> are more likely to experience a significant complication related to implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation in comparison with men. Whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in treatment decisions reflect patient preferences or treatment biases requires further study.</p>

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> category (Sc, ie, fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-independent thromboembolism risk) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we calculated risks based on the pseudovalue method. Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute risk of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The risk ratio (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> as reference) across points >1 indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> exhibit a higher stroke risk. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is a risk modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> category criterion), but the Sc risk component modifies and accentuates stroke risk in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke risk factors.</p></sec>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> and 54 men) frequency matched for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> but not among men, perhaps reflecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>) from 4 community-based European studies (FINRISK, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common risk factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable risk by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001).

No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable risk of all risk factors combined was 41.9% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> and 46.0% in men.

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism. Similar to humans, fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. In addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> hormones, the X and Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> (XX) versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> (XY) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. AAAs from XY fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. Moreover, aortas from XY fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement in phenotypic fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity.

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> or species with the leg coloration of another. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> pheromones, we were able to deduce whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> recognition template for conspecific fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>, and especially the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>, but that contained a subset of fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> or fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-like features, fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>. Taken together, our data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> identification when a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition among dioecious plants affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> ratios and the spatial distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es in different environments. At present, little is known about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual and inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, or one fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> and one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive ability between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s subjected to intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition were observed, although the growth of fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s was moderately greater under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in competitive ability, especially under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Under salinity stress, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s than in fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. In addition, salt-stressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s growing intermixed with fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s under salt stress can importantly affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

Genetics, Lifestyle, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young and Apparently Healthy Women

Sex Differences in the Presentation and Perception of Symptoms Among Young Patients With Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Some studies report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> are less likely to present with chest pain for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Prevalence of Subclinical Coronary Artery Disease in Masters Endurance Athletes With a Low Atherosclerotic Risk Profile
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies in middle-age and older (masters) athletes with atherosclerotic risk factors for coronary artery disease report higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores compared with sedentary individuals. Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>) and 92 controls of similar age, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC score. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, and only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%).

Excess Cardiovascular Risk in Women Relative to Men Referred for Coronary Angiography Is Associated With Severely Impaired Coronary Flow Reserve, Not Obstructive Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) fatality rates are higher for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> than for men, yet obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is less prevalent in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>. Coronary flow reserve (CFR), an integrated measure of large- and small-vessel CAD and myocardial ischemia, identifies patients at risk for CVD death, but is not routinely measured in clinical practice. We sought to investigate the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>, CFR, and angiographic CAD severity on adverse cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Consecutive patients (n=329, 43% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>) referred for invasive coronary angiography after stress testing with myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography and with left ventricular ejection fraction >40% were followed (median, 3.0 years) for a composite end point of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death and hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction or heart failure. The extent and severity of angiographic CAD were estimated by using the CAD prognostic index, and CFR was quantified by using positron emission tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> in comparison with men had lower pretest clinical scores, rates of prior myocardial infarction, and burden of angiographic CAD (<i>P</i><0.001), they demonstrated greater risk of CVD events, even after adjustment for traditional risk factors, imaging findings, and early revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–4.02; <i>P</i>=0.03).

After also adjusting for CFR, the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> on outcomes was no longer significant.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e genes reveals distinct vegetative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution.</p>

In this study, we assessed the effect of 2-year treatment with rosuvastatin on carotid IMT in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH (age, 6–<18 years) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >4.9 mmol/L or >4.1 mmol/L in combination with other risk factors received rosuvastatin for 2 years, starting at 5 mg once daily, with uptitration to 10 mg (age, 6–<10 years) or 20 mg (age, 10–<18 years). Carotid IMT was assessed by ultrasonography at baseline and 12 and 24 months in all patients and in age-matched unaffected siblings. Carotid IMT was measured at 3 locations (common carotid artery, carotid bulb, internal carotid artery) in both the left and right carotid arteries. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate differences in carotid IMT between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH and the unaffected siblings. <i>P</i> values were adjusted for age, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>, carotid artery site, and family relations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, mean±SD carotid IMT was significantly greater for the 197 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH compared with the 65 unaffected siblings (0.397±0.049 and 0.377±0.045 mm, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.001). During 2 years of follow-up, the change in carotid IMT was 0.0054 mm/y (95% confidence interval, 0.0030–0.0082) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH and 0.0143 mm/y (95% confidence interval, 0.0095–0.0192) in unaffected siblings (<i>P</i>=0.002). The end-of-study difference in mean carotid IMT between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH and unaffected siblings after 2 years was no longer significant (0.408±0.043 and 0.402±0.042 mm, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH who were ≥6 years of age, carotid IMT was significantly greater at baseline compared with unaffected siblings.

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new criteria for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> using these criteria and to compare the findings with a group of Australian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> at low risk for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was performed on high-risk Indigenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia.

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p>Temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is determined by the ambient temperature during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a temperature at which all offspring develop into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s) triggers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-to-fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination in a turtle species.</p>

For each individual with CHD, we identified 10 members of the general population utilizing the Danish Civil Registration System matched on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> and birth year. We computed cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia, adjusting for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> and birth year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cumulative incidence of dementia was 4% by 80 years of age in 10 632 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with CHD (46% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>). The overall HR comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with CHD with the general population cohort was 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3−2.0). The HR among individuals with CHD without extracardiac defects was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1−1.8). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with mild-to-moderate CHD had an HR of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1−2.0), whereas the HR was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2−3.3) for severe CHD, including univentricular hearts. The HR for early onset dementia (<65 years of age) was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.8−3.8), whereas the late-onset HR was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0−1.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CHD was associated with an increased risk of dementia compared with the general population, in particular for early onset dementia.

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children.

In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood.

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differences in the morphological and physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder under stressful conditions. However, little is known about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific differences in responses to nutrient deficiencies. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies on the morphological, physiological and chloroplast ultrastructural traits of <i>P. cathayana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s were investigated. The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher photosynthesis, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in chloroplasts than did fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s when exposed to N- and P-deficiency conditions. Nitrogen-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher glutamate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities, and a more intact chloroplast ultrastructure, but less starch accumulation than did N-deficient fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. Phosphorus-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and acid phosphatase activities, but a lower foliar N : P ratio and less PSII damage than did P-deficient fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. These results suggest that N and P deficiencies cause greater negative effects on fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s than on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, and that the different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es of <i>P. cathayana</i> may employ different strategies to cope with N and P deficiencies.</p>

Down-regulation of the Sucrose Transporter <i>CsSUT1</i> Causes Male Sterility by Altering Carbohydrate Supply
<p>In plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility, but it remains unclear whether Suc transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-affinity Suc-H<sup>+</sup> symporter. <i>CsSUT1</i> is expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen, and companion cells of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments, and pedicel. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flowers of <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNA interference (RNAi) lines exhibited a decrease in Suc, hexose, and starch content, relative to those of the wild type, during the later stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flower development, a finding that was highly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport, and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most <i>myeloblastosis</i> (<i>MYB</i>) transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNAi lines relative to wild type. Our findings demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <i>CsSUT1</i> expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific <i>MYB</i> transcription factors. This knowledge provides a new approach for bioengineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility in crop plants.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-to-fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome differentiation has been atypically low.

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e or embryo, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly documented that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic development, the original compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es by micromanipulation, the enucleolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing embryos. After removal of NPBs from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not used in embryonic development and that the nucleoli in developing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>.

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This document provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this document discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal contamination, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s to cadmium (Cd) stress under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> cultivation, plants of opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es exposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Under intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition, fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s performed better under intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition than under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s improved the fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. These results demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> of neighbor plants and competition affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-contaminated soils.</p>

Male sex in houseflies is determined by <i>Mdmd</i>, a paralog of the generic splice factor gene <i>CWC22</i>
<p>Across species, animals have diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination pathways, each consisting of a hierarchical cascade of genes and its associated regulatory mechanism. Houseflies have a distinctive polymorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination system in which a dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> determiner, the M-factor, can reside on any of the chromosomes. We identified a gene, <i>Musca domestica</i> <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> determiner</i> (<i>Mdmd</i>), as the M-factor. <i>Mdmd</i> originated from a duplication of the spliceosomal factor gene <i>CWC22</i> (<i>nucampholin</i>). Targeted <i>Mdmd</i> disruption results in complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal to fertile fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s because of a shift from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> to fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> expression of the downstream genes <i>transformer</i> and <i>double<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong></i>. The presence of <i>Mdmd</i> on different chromosomes indicates that <i>Mdmd</i> translocated to different genomic sites. Thus, an instructive signal in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination can arise by duplication and neofunctionalization of an essential splicing regulator.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive genes that become “co-opted” by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, we screened fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s that is transferred to fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-expressed paralog had no significant effect on fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s by acting on a common, fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-expressed target. After duplication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome

Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX insects to follow the fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s (XX) that are fertile. The virgin fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s mated with these masculinized genetic fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s produced all fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination is present on the Y chromosome.

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in monocytes from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that monocytes from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that monocytes from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in monocytes, because knocking down IRF8 in monocytes from younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in monocytes from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> monocytes was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

Are hormones a “female problem” for animal research?
<p>One of the most deep-seated misconceptions about the human psyche is that men are simple and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> are complicated (<i>1</i>). Gender psychology scholars trace this belief back to at least the 19th century, when the long-standing view that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> were inferior versions of men started to fall out of favor (<i>2</i>). In response, biological theories on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es were restructured into a narrative that characterized the emergent psychological properties of the fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> brain—“sensitivity, perceptual acumen, and emotionality”—as not lesser than, but complementary to, those of men's brains (<i>1</i>). This framed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> as a disordered, unstable yin to men's rational, orderly yang, thus preserving the patriarchy. So-called scientific explanations of why <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>'s mental proclivities deviated from men's relied heavily on the purported influence of reproductive physiology on the fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> mind (<i>3</i>). More than 100 years later, this idea still shapes not just how society perceives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> but also how biomedical scientists approach animal research.</p>

Ductal sex determination
<p>How the physical differences between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es develop is an intriguing process. In mammals, the first important stage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination occurs during fetal life, when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-determining Y chromosome expresses a gene called <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determining region Y</i> (<i>SRY</i>), which acts on the bipotential gonad to initiate testis (instead of ovary) formation (<i>1</i>). Landmark experiments by Jost in the 1950s showed that the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific structures is established by factors produced from the emerging testis, namely androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (<i>2</i>). This suggested that the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> characteristics is an active process, whereas fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific differentiation is passive. On page 717 of this issue, Zhao <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> development is also an active process.</p>

<p>Pregnant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> long have been excluded from vaccine studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new report from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> be included in the trial of experimental Zika vaccines, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The report is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each vaccine and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika vaccine that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>, says a co-author of the report. Other experimental maternal immunizations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, includes pregnant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>. A vaccine against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>, too. A second new report on maternal immunizations issued last week explores the challenges of doing safety studies in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> and their babies.</p>

Cognitive science in the field: A preschool intervention durably enhances intuitive but not formal mathematics
<p>Many poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> are underprepared for demanding primary school curricula. Research in cognitive science suggests that school achievement could be improved by preschool pedagogy in which numerate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s engage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s spontaneous, nonsymbolic mathematical concepts. To test this suggestion, we designed and evaluated a game-based preschool curriculum intended to exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s emerging skills in number and geometry. In a randomized field experiment with 1540 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (average age 4.9 years) in 214 Indian preschools, 4 months of math game play yielded marked and enduring improvement on the exercised intuitive abilities, relative to no-treatment and active control conditions. Math-trained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> also showed immediate gains on symbolic mathematical skills but displayed no advantage in subsequent learning of the language and concepts of school mathematics.</p>

Gender stereotypes about intellectual ability emerge early and influence children’s interests
<p>Common stereotypes associate high-level intellectual ability (brilliance, genius, etc.) with men more than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>. These stereotypes discourage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong>’s pursuit of many prestigious careers; that is, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">women</span></strong> are underrepresented in fields whose members cherish brilliance (such as physics and philosophy). Here we show that these stereotypes are endorsed by, and influence the interests of, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> as young as 6. Specifically, 6-year-old girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are “really, really smart.” Also at age 6, girls begin to avoid activities said to be for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who are “really, really smart.” These findings suggest that gendered notions of brilliance are acquired early and have an immediate effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s interests.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Gibberellin Induces Diploid Pollen Formation by Interfering with Meiotic Cytokinesis
<p>The plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) controls many physiological processes, including cell differentiation, cell elongation, seed germination, and response to abiotic stress. In this study, we report that exogenous treatment of flowering Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with GA specifically affects the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis leading to meiotic restitution and the production of diploid (2n) pollen grains. Similar defects in meiotic cell division and reproductive ploidy stability occur in Arabidopsis plants depleted of RGA and GAI, two members of the DELLA family that function as suppressor of GA signaling. Cytological analysis of the double <i>rga-24 gai-t6</i> mutant revealed that defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis are not caused by alterations in meiosis I (MI or meiosis II (MII) chromosome dynamics, but instead result from aberrations in the spatial organization of the phragmoplast-like radial microtubule arrays (RMAs) at the end of meiosis II. In line with a role for GA in the genetic regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive system, we additionally show that DELLA downstream targets MYB33 and MYB65 are redundantly required for functional RMA biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis. By analyzing the expression of <i>pRGA::GFP-RGA</i> in the wild-type Landsberg <i>erecta</i> background, we demonstrate that the GFP-RGA protein is specifically expressed in the anther cell layers surrounding the meiocytes and microspores, suggesting that appropriate GA signaling in the somatic anther tissue is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cell wall formation and thus plays an important role in consolidating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> gametophytic ploidy consistency.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s fighting. We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, a shallower gradient was observed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s as compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. Cancer prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident cancer in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related cancer cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident cancer in the population of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for radiation surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

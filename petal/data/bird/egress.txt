Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> approach less popular. However, the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the mean SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group (91% of mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; mean SST score 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>   group (mean ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> group;   mean 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tunnel EVH, and 6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Red Light-Induced Phosphorylation of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in Stomatal Guard Cells
<p>Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing is stimulated by red and blue light. Blue light activates plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by phosphorylating its penultimate residue, threonine, via a blue light photoreceptor phototropin-mediated signaling pathway in guard cells. Blue light-activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase promotes the accumulation of osmolytes and, thus, the osmotic influx of water into guard cells, driving stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. Red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing is thought to be dependent on photosynthesis in both guard cell chloroplasts and mesophyll cells; however, how red light induces stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and whether PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is involved in this process have remained unclear. In this study, we established an immunohistochemical technique to detect the phosphorylation level of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and unexpectedly found that red light induces PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves. Red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves was correlated with stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing under red light and was inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid. In <i>aha1</i>-<i>9</i>, a knockout mutant of one of the major isoforms of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells, red light-dependent stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing was delayed in whole leaves. Furthermore, the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibited red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation as well as red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in whole leaves. Our results indicate that red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in guard cells promotes stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in whole leaves, providing insight into the photosynthetic regulation of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing under red light.</p>

Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme
<p>Embryos of medaka <i>Oryzias latipes</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hatch</span></strong> in freshwater, while those of killifish <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hatch</span></strong> in brackish water. Medaka and <i>Fundulus</i> possess two kinds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hatch</span></strong>ing enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), which cooperatively digest their egg envelope at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hatch</span></strong>ing. Optimal salinity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two <i>Fundulus</i> HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each salinity at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hatch</span></strong>ing. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope digestion in various salinities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single site at position 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two enzymes. Superimposition of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that position 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active site cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that position 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with recognition of primary structure around the cleavage site, but with recognition of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair of the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-operatively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-operatively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-tear was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256).

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

De novo phosphorylation and conformational opening of the tyrosine kinase Lck act in concert to initiate T cell receptor signaling
<p>The enzymatic activity of the Src family tyrosine kinase p56<sup>Lck</sup> (Lck) is tightly controlled by differential phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues, Tyr<sup>394</sup> and Tyr<sup>505</sup>. Phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> and the conformational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing of Lck are believed to activate the kinase, whereas Tyr<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation is thought to generate a closed, inactive conformation of Lck. We investigated whether the conformation of Lck and its phosphorylation state act in concert to regulate the initiation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. With a sensitive biosensor, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to investigate the conformations of wild-type Lck and its phosphorylation-deficient mutants Y394F and Y505F and the double mutant Y394F/Y505F in unstimulated T cells and after TCR stimulation. With this approach, we separated the conformational changes of Lck from the phosphorylation state of its regulatory tyrosines. We showed that the conformational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing of Lck alone was insufficient to initiate signaling events in T cells. Rather, Lck additionally required phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> to induce T cell activation. Consistent with the FLIM measurements, an optimized immunofluorescence microscopy protocol revealed that the TCR-stimulated phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr<sup>394</sup> occurred preferentially at the plasma membrane of Jurkat cells and primary human T cells. Our study supports the hypothesis that T cell activation through the TCR complex is accompanied by the de novo activation of Lck and that phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> plays a role in Lck function that goes beyond inducing an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> conformation of the kinase.</p>

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> and close, and it has been assumed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA melting. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal motions control the promoter search and drive DNA melting in the absence of external energy sources.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frame after translation of the upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

The Role of ENHANCED RESPONSES TO ABA1 (ERA1) in Arabidopsis Stomatal Responses Is Beyond ABA Signaling
<p>Proper stomatal responses are essential for plant function in an altered environment. The core signaling pathway for abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure involves perception of the hormone that leads to the activation of guard cell anion channels by the protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> STOMATA1. Several other regulators are suggested to modulate the ABA signaling pathway, including the protein ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA1 (ERA1), that encodes the farnesyl transferase β-subunit. The <i>era1</i> mutant is hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and shows a more closed stomata phenotype. Using a genetics approach with the double mutants <i>era1 abi1-1</i> and <i>era1 ost1</i>, we show that while <i>era1</i> suppressed the high stomatal conductance of <i>abi1-1</i> and <i>ost1</i>, the ERA1 function was not required for stomatal closure in response to ABA and environmental factors. Further experiments indicated a role for ERA1 in blue light-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing. In addition, we show that ERA1 function in disease resistance was independent of its role in stomatal regulation. Our results indicate a function for ERA1 in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing and pathogen immunity.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing valves reminiscent of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the event of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), mortality is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day mortality after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day mortality in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower mortality. Long-term mortality in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair. Mortality after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of mortality after elective AAA repair, but results of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair have improved as well. However, late mortality from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope
<p>The identification of isotopic labels by conventional macroscopic techniques lacks spatial resolution and requires relatively large quantities of material for measurements. We recorded the vibrational spectra of an α amino acid, <sc>l</sc>-alanine, with damage-free “aloof” electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to directly resolve carbon-site–specific isotopic labels in real space with nanoscale spatial resolution. An isotopic red shift of 4.8 ± 0.4 milli–electron volts in C–O asymmetric stretching modes was observed for <sup>13</sup>C-labeled <sc>l</sc>-alanine at the carboxylate carbon site, which was confirmed by macroscopic infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

Solid-state experiments can, therefore, yield insights into the behavior of quantum-relativistic matter under extreme conditions.</p>

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening tool that could greatly reduce the need for six common animal tests. Those tests account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million animals used annually in risk testing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of animal tests for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal testing.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">door</span></strong> to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

Activation mechanism of a human SK-calmodulin channel complex elucidated by cryo-EM structures
<p>Small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels mediate neuron excitability and are associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity. They also regulate immune responses and the size of blood cells. Activation of SK channels requires calmodulin (CaM), but how CaM binds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>s SK channels has been unclear. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a human SK4-CaM channel complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one channel tetramer. Each lobe of CaM serves a distinct function: The C-lobe binds to the channel constitutively, whereas the N-lobe interacts with the S4-S5 linker in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The S4-S5 linker, which contains two distinct helices, undergoes conformational changes upon CaM binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> the channel pore. These structures reveal the gating mechanism of SK channels and provide a basis for understanding SK channel pharmacology.</p>

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of topology have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

Unnaturally aglow with a bright inner light
<p>Bioluminescent insects, fungi, and sea creatures must have seemed mysterious and supernatural to the people of antiquity. It was not until the late 19th century that science began to displace the magic by demonstrating that bioluminescence in insects, such as the firefly (<i>Photinus pyralis</i>), is a chemical reaction that requires a protein (a luciferase) and substrates [adenosine triphosphate (ATP), O<sub>2</sub>, and a luciferin, <sc>d</sc>-luciferin] (<i>1</i>). Understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of bioluminescence has grown over the past century, as has appreciation of its widespread prevalence in nature. Since cloning the gene for firefly luciferase (<i>2</i>), researchers have sought to exploit this molecular lightbulb for bioanalysis applications and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) in model animals (<i>3</i>). On page 935 of this issue, Iwano <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) report the development of a luciferase-luciferin pair that, due to its brightness and red-colored glow, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>s the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">door</span></strong> to a range of biomedical applications, such as detection of single cells deep within tissue, that were not previously feasible with BLI.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

State-to-state chemistry for three-body recombination in an ultracold rubidium gas

Here we prepare an ultracold few-body quantum state of reactants and demonstrate state-to-state chemistry for the recombination of three spin-polarized ultracold rubidium (Rb) atoms to form a weakly bound Rb<sub>2</sub> molecule. The measured product distribution covers about 90% of the final products, and we are able to discriminate between product states with a level splitting as small as 20 megahertz multiplied by Planck’s constant. Furthermore, we formulate pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity rules for the distribution of products, and we develop a theoretical model that predicts many of our experimental observations.

Second-scale nuclear spin coherence time of ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K molecules

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric ion channels assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transitions from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> to a closed conformation. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in ion channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformation of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporation of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interactions, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and function, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>s the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">door</span></strong> to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

A uORF Represses the Transcription Factor AtHB1 in Aerial Tissues to Avoid a Deleterious Phenotype
<p>AtHB1 is an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor that participates in hypocotyl elongation under short-day conditions. Here, we show that its expression is posttranscriptionally regulated by an upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frame (uORF) located in its 5′ untranslated region. This uORF encodes a highly conserved peptide (CPuORF) that is present in varied monocot and dicot species. The Arabidopsis uORF and its maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) homolog repressed the translation of the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reading frame in cis, independent of the sequence of the latter. Published ribosome footprinting results and the analysis of a frame-shifted uORF, in which the repression capability was lost, indicated that the uORF causes ribosome stalling. The regulation exerted by the CPuORF was tissue specific and did not act in the absence of light. Moreover, a photosynthetic signal is needed for the CPuORF action, since plants with uncoupled chloroplasts did not show uORF-dependent repression. Plants transformed with the native <i>AtHB1</i> promoter driving <i>AtHB1</i> expression did not show differential phenotypes, whereas those transformed with a construct in which the uORF was mutated exhibited serrated leaves, compact rosettes, and, most significantly, short nondehiscent anthers and siliques containing fewer or no seeds. Thus, we propose that the uncontrolled expression of <i>AtHB1</i> is deleterious for the plant and, hence, finely repressed by a translational mechanism.</p>

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful fertilization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing (dehiscence), results in male sterility, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 regulates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and fertility. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly regulates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of regulation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-regulates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and fertility rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this regulation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of regulatory controls through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing.</p>

Fast, Accurate and Automatic Ancient Nucleosome and Methylation Maps with epiPALEOMIX
<p>The first epigenomes from archaic hominins (AH) and ancient anatomically modern humans (AMH) have recently been characterized, based, however, on a limited number of samples. The extent to which ancient genome-wide epigenetic landscapes can be reconstructed thus remains contentious. Here, we present epiPALEOMIX, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>-source and user-friendly pipeline that exploits post-mortem DNA degradation patterns to reconstruct ancient methylomes and nucleosome maps from shotgun and/or capture-enrichment data. Applying epiPALEOMIX to the sequence data underlying 35 ancient genomes including AMH, AH, equids and aurochs, we investigate the temporal, geographical and preservation range of ancient epigenetic signatures. We first assess the quality of inferred ancient epigenetic signatures within well-characterized genomic regions. We find that tissue-specific methylation signatures can be obtained across a wider range of DNA preparation types than previously thought, including when no particular experimental procedures have been used to remove deaminated cytosines prior to sequencing. We identify a large subset of samples for which DNA associated with nucleosomes is protected from post-mortem degradation, and nucleosome positioning patterns can be reconstructed. Finally, we describe parameters and conditions such as DNA damage levels and sequencing depth that limit the preservation of epigenetic signatures in ancient samples. When such conditions are met, we propose that epigenetic profiles of CTCF binding regions can be used to help data authentication. Our work, including epiPALEOMIX, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>s for further investigations of ancient epigenomes through time especially aimed at tracking possible epigenetic changes during major evolutionary, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural shifts.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>ing events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

The use of an anterior pelvic internal fixator to treat disruptions of the anterior pelvic ring
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator is increasingly used for   the treatment of unstable, or displaced, injuries of the anterior   pelvic ring. The evidence for its use, however, is limited. The   aim of this paper is to describe the indications for its use, how   it is applied and its complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the case notes and radiographs of 50 patients treated   with an anterior pelvic internal fixator between April 2010 and   December 2015 at a major trauma centre in the United Kingdom. The   median follow-up time was 38 months (interquartile range 24 to 51).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three patients were excluded from the analysis leaving 47 patients   with complete follow-up data. Of the 47 patients, 46 achieved radiological   union and one progressed to an asymptomatic nonunion. Of the remaining patients,   45 required supplementary posterior fixation with percutaneous iliosacral   screws, 2 of which required sacral plating. The incidence of injury   to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) was 34%. The rate   of infection was 2%. There were no other significant complications.   Without this treatment, 44 patients (94%) would have needed unilateral   or bilateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction and plate fixation extending laterally   to the hip joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator reduces the need for extensive   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> surgery and is a useful addition to the armamentarium for the   treatment of anterior pelvic injuries.

A case–control study of surgical site infection following operative fixation of fractures of the ankle in a large UK trauma unit
<p>Most of the literature on surgical site infections   following the surgical treatment of fractures of the ankle is based   on small series of patients, focusing on diabetics or the elderly.   None have described post-operative functional scores in those patients   who develop an infection. We performed an age- and gender-matched   case–control study to identify patient- and surgery-related risk   factors for surgical site infection following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction and   internal fixation of a fracture of the ankle. Logistic regression   analysis was used to identify significant risk factors for infection   and to calculate odds ratios (OR). Function was assessed using the   Olerud and Molander Ankle Score. The incidence of infection was   4% (29/717) and 1.1% (8/717) were deep infections. The median ankle   score was significantly lower in the infection group compared with   the control group (60 <i>vs</i> 90, Mann–Whitney test   p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that diabetes   (OR = 15, p = 0.031), nursing home residence (OR = 12, p = 0.018)   and Weber C fractures (OR = 4, p = 0.048) were significant risk   factors for infection.</p><p>A low incidence of infection following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction and internal   fixation of fractures of the ankle was observed.

Prevalence, Incidence, and Mortality of Stroke in China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>China bears the biggest stroke burden in the world. However, little is known about the current prevalence, incidence, and mortality of stroke at the national level, and the trend in the past 30 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 2013, a nationally representative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">door</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">door</span></strong> survey was conducted in 155 urban and rural centers in 31 provinces in China, totaling 480 687 adults aged ≥20 years. All stroke survivors were considered as prevalent stroke cases at the prevalent time (August 31, 2013). First-ever strokes that occurred during 1 year preceding the survey point-prevalent time were considered as incident cases. According to computed tomography/MRI/autopsy findings, strokes were categorized into ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke of undetermined type.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 480 687 participants, 7672 were diagnosed with a prevalent stroke (1596.0/100 000 people) and 1643 with incident strokes (345.1/100 000 person-years). The age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates were 1114.8/100 000 people, 246.8 and 114.8/100 000 person-years, respectively. Pathological type of stroke was documented by computed tomography/MRI brain scanning in 90% of prevalent and 83% of incident stroke cases. Among incident and prevalent strokes, ischemic stroke constituted 69.6% and 77.8%, intracerebral hemorrhage 23.8% and 15.8%, subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.4% and 4.4%, and undetermined type 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Age-specific stroke prevalence in men aged ≥40 years was significantly greater than the prevalence in women (<i>P</i><0.001). The most prevalent risk factors among stroke survivors were hypertension (88%), smoking (48%), and alcohol use (44%). Stroke prevalence estimates in 2013 were statistically greater than those reported in China 3 decades ago, especially among rural residents (<i>P</i>=0.017). The highest annual incidence and mortality of stroke was in Northeast (365 and 159/100 000 person-years), then Central areas (326 and 154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest incidence was in Southwest China (154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest mortality was in South China (65/100 000 person-years) (<i>P</i><0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Stroke burden in China has increased over the past 30 years, and remains particularly high in rural areas. There is a north-to-south gradient in stroke in China, with the greatest stroke burden observed in the northern and central regions.</p></sec>

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No reliable comparative data exist between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms (MAAAs). This nationwide study assessed outcomes after OR and EVAR for MAAA in a population-based cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for MAAAs in Sweden between 1994 and 2014 were identified in the Swedish vascular registry. The primary aim was to assess survival after MAAA with OR and EVAR. Secondary aims were analyses of the rate of recurrent infections and reoperations, and time trends in surgical treatment. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. A pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score–weighted correction for risk factor differences in the 2 groups was performed, including the operation year to account for differences in treatment and outcomes over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 132 patients (0.6% of all operated abdominal aortic aneurysms in Sweden). Mean age was 70 years (standard deviation, 9.2), and 50 presented with rupture. Survival at 3 months was 86% (95% confidence interval, 80%–92%), at 1 year 79% (72%–86%), and at 5 years 59% (50%–68%). The preferred operative technique shifted from OR to EVAR after 2001 (proportion EVAR 1994–2000 0%, 2001–2007 58%, 2008–2014 60%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> repair was performed in 62 patients (47%): aortic resection and extra-anatomic bypass (n=7), in situ reconstruction (n=50), and patch plasty (n=3); 2 patients died intraoperatively. EVAR was performed in 70 patients (53%): standard EVAR (n=55), fenestrated/branched EVAR (n=8), and visceral deviation with stent grafting (n=7); no deaths occurred intraoperatively. Survival at 3 months was lower for OR than for EVAR (74% versus 96%, <i>P</i><0.001), with a similar trend present at 1 year (73% versus 84%, <i>P</i>=0.054). A pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong>sity score–weighted risk-adjusted analysis confirmed the early better survival associated with EVAR. During median follow-up of 36 and 41 months for OR and EVAR, respectively, there was no difference in long-term survival (5 years 60% versus 58%, <i>P</i>=0.771), infection-related complications (18% versus 24%, <i>P</i>=0.439), or reoperation (21% versus 24%, <i>P</i>=0.650).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in treatment of MAAA in Sweden, with EVAR being the preferred treatment modality.

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to test the null hypothesis that there   is no difference, from the payer perspective, in the cost of treatment   of a distal radial fracture in an elderly patient, aged > 65 years,   between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and closed reduction (CR).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Data relating to the treatment of these injuries in the elderly   between January 2007 and December 2015 were extracted using the   Humana and Medicare Advantage Databases. The primary outcome of   interest was the cost associated with treatment. Secondary analysis included   the cost of common complications. Statistical analysis was performed   using a non-parametric <i>t</i>-test and chi-squared test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our search yielded 8924 patients treated with ORIF and 5629 patients   treated with CR. The mean cost of an uncomplicated ORIF was more   than a CR ($7749 <i>versus</i> $2161). The mean additional   cost of a complication in the ORIF group was greater than in the   CR group ($1853 <i>versus</i> $1362).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings show that there are greater payer fees associated   with ORIF than CR in patients aged > 65 years with a distal radial   fracture. CR may be a higher-value intervention in these patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:205–11.</p></sec>

The role of a small posterior malleolar fragment in trimalleolar fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a posterior   malleolar fragment (PMF), with < 25% ankle joint surface, on   pressure distribution and joint-stability. There is still little   scientific evidence available to advise on the size of PMF, which   is essential to provide treatment. To date, studies show inconsistent   results and recommendations for surgical treatment date from 1940.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 12 cadaveric ankles were assigned to two study groups.   A trimalleolar fracture was created, followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction   and internal fixation. PMF was fixed in Group I, but not in Group   II. Intra-articular pressure was measured and cyclic loading was   performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Contact area decreased following each fracture, while anatomical   fixation restored it nearly to its intact level. Contact pressure   decreased significantly with fixation of the PMF. In plantarflexion,   the centre of force shifted significantly posteriorly in Group II   and anteriorly in Group I. Load to failure testing showed no difference   between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Surgical reduction of a small PMF with less than 25% ankle joint   surface improves pressure distribution but does not affect ankle   joint stability.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:95–100.</p></sec>

Fractures of the femoral shaft in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of closed   isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children, and to compare   the treatment and length of stay (LOS) between major trauma centres   (MTCs) and trauma units (TUs) in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>National data were obtained from the Trauma and Audit Research   Network for all isolated, closed fractures of the femoral shaft   in children from birth to 15 years of age, between 2012 and 2015.   Age, gender, the season in which the fracture occurred, non-accidental   injury, the mechanism of injury, hospital trauma status, LOS and   type of treatment were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1852 fractures were identified. The mean annual incidence   was 5.82 per 100 000 children (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.20   to 6.44). The age of peak incidence was two years for both boys   and girls; this decreased with increasing age. Children aged four   to six years treated in MTCs were more likely to be managed with   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">open</span></strong> reduction and internal fixation compared with those treated   in TUs (odds ratio 3.20; 95% CI 1.12 to 9.14; p = 0.03). The median LOS   was significantly less in MTCs than in TUs for children aged between   18 months and three years treated in both a spica (p = 0.005) and   traction (p = 0.0004). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the current national trends in the management   of closed isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children following   activation of major trauma networks in 2012. Future studies focusing   on the reasons for the differences which have been identified may   help to achieve more consistency in the management of these injuries across   the trauma networks.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:109–18.</p></sec>

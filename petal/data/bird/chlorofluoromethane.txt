Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to value-added products.</p>

Particulate methane monooxygenase contains only mononuclear copper centers
<p>Bacteria that oxidize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol are central to mitigating emissions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, a potent greenhouse gas. The nature of the copper active site in the primary metabolic enzyme of these bacteria, particulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e monooxygenase (pMMO), has been controversial owing to seemingly contradictory biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic results. We present biochemical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (Cu<sub>B</sub>) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (Cu<sub>C</sub>). On the basis of these results, we propose that a monocopper site is able to catalyze <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e oxidation in pMMO.</p>

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More oxygenated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol using molecular oxygen is possible.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol
<p>Direct functionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in natural gas remains a key challenge. We present a direct stepwise method for converting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (~97%) over a copper-containing zeolite, based on partial oxidation with water. The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by water with concurrent formation of hydrogen.</p>

Methane production from coal by a single methanogen
<p>Coal-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e is one of the largest unconventional natural gas resources. Although microbial activity may greatly contribute to coal-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e formation, it is unclear whether the complex aromatic organic compounds present in coal can be used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis. We show that deep subsurface–derived <i>Methermicoccus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogens can produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from more than 30 types of methoxylated aromatic compounds (MACs) as well as from coals containing MACs. In contrast to known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis pathways involving one- and two-carbon compounds, this “methoxydotrophic” mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis couples <i>O</i>-demethylation, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and possibly acetyl–coenzyme A metabolism. Because MACs derived from lignin may occur widely in subsurface sediments, methoxydotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis would play an important role in the formation of natural gas not limited to coal-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and in the global carbon cycle.</p>

Selective functionalization of methane, ethane, and higher alkanes by cerium photocatalysis
<p>With the recent soaring production of natural gas, the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and other light hydrocarbon feedstocks as starting materials in synthetic transformations is becoming increasingly economically attractive, although it remains chemically challenging. We report the development of photocatalytic C–H amination, alkylation, and arylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, ethane, and higher alkanes under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature. High catalytic efficiency (turnover numbers up to 2900 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and 9700 for ethane) and selectivity were achieved using abundant, inexpensive cerium salts as photocatalysts. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation generated alkoxy radicals from simple alcohols that in turn acted as hydrogen atom transfer catalysts. The mixed-phase gas/liquid reaction was adapted to continuous flow, enabling the efficient use of gaseous feedstocks in scalable photocatalytic transformations.</p>

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products.

There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ation, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ated soils.</p>

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Structural basis for methylphosphonate biosynthesis
<p>Methylphosphonate synthase (MPnS) produces methylphosphonate, a metabolic precursor to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in the upper ocean. Here, we determine a 2.35-angstrom resolution structure of MPnS and discover that it has an unusual 2-histidine-1-glutamine iron-coordinating triad. We further solve the structure of a related enzyme, hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase from <i>Streptomyces albus</i> (<i>Sa</i>HEPD), and find that it displays the same motif. <i>Sa</i>HEPD can be converted into an MPnS by mutation of glutamine-adjacent residues, identifying the molecular requirements for methylphosphonate synthesis. Using these sequence markers, we find numerous putative MPnSs in marine microbiomes and confirm that MPnS is present in the abundant <i>Pelagibacter ubique.</i> The ubiquity of MPnS-containing microbes supports the proposal that methylphosphonate is a source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in the upper, aerobic ocean, where phosphorus-starved microbes catabolize methylphosphonate for its phosphorus.</p>

Estimating the health benefits of environmental regulations

Benefits analysis, one side of benefit-cost analysis (BCA), can be relatively straightforward when sufficient data are available on dose-response relationships, changes in exposure expected from a proposed policy, and other key inputs. But despite progress, benefits analysis for health effects is needlessly constrained by analytic practices that are scientifically outdated and inconsistent with economic theory. These limitations can result in exclusion of important health effects from the estimated benefits of reducing exposure to toxic environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants, which, in turn, affects net benefits calculations that inform public policy.

The biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme F430 in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea
<p>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the key enzyme of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis and anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e oxidation. The activity of MCR is dependent on the unique nickel-containing tetrapyrrole known as coenzyme F430. We used comparative genomics to identify the coenzyme F430 biosynthesis (<i>cfb</i>) genes and characterized the encoded enzymes from <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>osarcina acetivorans</i> C2A. The pathway involves nickelochelation by a nickel-specific chelatase, followed by amidation to form Ni-sirohydrochlorin <i>a</i>,<i>c</i>-diamide. Next, a primitive homolog of nitrogenase mediates a six-electron reduction and γ-lactamization reaction before a Mur ligase homolog forms the six-membered carbocyclic ring in the final step of the pathway. These data show that coenzyme F430 can be synthesized from sirohydrochlorin using Cfb enzymes produced heterologously in a non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogen host and identify several targets for inhibitors of biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e formation.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of food allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ating other foods can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG antibodies have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant antibodies, identified the peanut allergen–specific antibodies, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated antibodies could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Predicting global killer whale population collapse from PCB pollution

Using an individual-based model framework and globally available data on PCB concentrations in killer whale tissues, we show that PCB-mediated effects on reproduction and immune function threaten the long-term viability of >50% of the world’s killer whale populations. PCB-mediated effects over the coming 100 years predicted that killer whale populations near industrialized regions, and those feeding at high trophic levels regardless of location, are at high risk of population collapse. Despite a near-global ban of PCBs more than 30 years ago, the world’s killer whales illustrate the troubling persistence of this chemical class.</p>

The South Asian monsoon—pollution pump and purifier
<p>Air pollution is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast pollution haze, but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth’s surface. However, some pollutants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan
<p>A strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever has become resistant to most every drug and is spreading through Pakistan, causing at least 2000 confirmed cases. The so-called extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous drugs that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops resistance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic resistance and spread are a result of poor sanitation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ated water supplies, which reflect the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start spreading outside of Pakistan.</p>

Dunes on Pluto
<p>The surface of Pluto is more geologically diverse and dynamic than had been expected, but the role of its tenuous atmosphere in shaping the landscape remains unclear. We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to mountainous regions and are orthogonal to nearby wind streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e ice in moderate winds (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent geological past.</p>

Methanogenic heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC-MvhAGD) uses two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters for reduction
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenic archaea, the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e-forming steps are linked through the heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC)–[NiFe]-hydrogenase (MvhAGD) complex that uses flavin-based electron bifurcation to reduce ferredoxin and the heterodisulfide of coenzymes M and B. Here, we present the structure of the native heterododecameric HdrABC-MvhAGD complex at 2.15-angstrom resolution. HdrB contains two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters composed of fused [3Fe-4S]-[2Fe-2S] units sharing 1 iron (Fe) and 1 sulfur (S), which were coordinated at the CCG motifs. Soaking experiments showed that the heterodisulfide is clamped between the two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters and homolytically cleaved, forming coenzyme M and B bound to each iron. Coenzymes are consecutively released upon one-by-one electron transfer. The HdrABC-MvhAGD atomic model serves as a structural template for numerous HdrABC homologs involved in diverse microbial metabolic pathways.</p>

Controlling guest conformation for efficient purification of butadiene
<p>Conventional adsorbents preferentially adsorb the small, high-polarity, and unsaturated 1,3-butadiene molecule over the other C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbons from which it must be separated. We show from single-crystal x-ray diffraction and computational simulation that a hydrophilic metal-organic framework, [Zn<sub>2</sub>(btm)<sub>2</sub>], where H<sub>2</sub>btm is bis(5-methyl-1<i>H</i>-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, has quasi-discrete pores that can induce conformational changes in the flexible guest molecules, weakening 1,3-butadiene adsorption through a large bending energy penalty. In a breakthrough operation at ambient temperature and pressure, this guest conformation–controlling adsorbent eluted 1,3-butadiene first, then butane, butene, and isobutene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene can be efficiently purified (≥99.5%) while avoiding high-temperature conditions that can lead to its undesirable polymerization.</p>

HAT-P-26b: A Neptune-mass exoplanet with a well-constrained heavy element abundance
<p>A correlation between giant-planet mass and atmospheric heavy elemental abundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System and has served as a cornerstone of planet-formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed atmospheric study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H<sub>2</sub>O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the transmission spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b’s atmospheric heavy element content ([Formula] times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b’s atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ation from metal-rich planetesimals.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, phenyl cation intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylation reactions. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl cation equivalents have received limited attention in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered applications in selective intermolecular processes. We report a reaction design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cation equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This reaction manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylation of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild conditions (30° to 100°C).</p>

Seagrass ecosystems reduce exposure to bacterial pathogens of humans, fishes, and invertebrates
<p>Plants are important in urban environments for removing pathogens and improving water quality. Seagrass meadows are the most widespread coastal ecosystem on the planet. Although these plants are known to be associated with natural biocide production, they have not been evaluated for their ability to remove microbiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ation. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA gene, we found that when seagrass meadows are present, there was a 50% reduction in the relative abundance of potential bacterial pathogens capable of causing disease in humans and marine organisms. Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 reef-building corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold reductions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters
<p>Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e formation starts with a challenging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–independent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation process. We explored this enzymatic process by solving the x-ray crystal structure of formyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ofuran dehydrogenase, determined here as Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>2</sub> and Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>4</sub> complexes, from <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>othermobacter wolfeii</i>. The latter 800-kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4Fe-4S] clusters. Catalysis is separately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase. CO<sub>2</sub> is first reduced to formate in FwdBD, which then diffuses through a 43-angstrom-long tunnel to FwdA, where it condenses with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ofuran to formyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ofuran. The arrangement of [4Fe-4S] clusters functions as an electron relay but potentially also couples the four tungstopterin active sites over 206 angstroms.</p>

Direct Proteomic Quantification of the Secretome of Activated Immune Cells
<sec><title>Tracking Secreted Proteins</title><p>The proteins secreted by cells provide a flow of information within tissues and are thus of particular interest. However, systematic detection of secreted proteins is tricky because they tend to be present in small amounts within complex mixtures of proteins where other components are very abundant. <bold>Meissner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 475) developed a method for screening the secreted proteins from cultured mouse macrophages in response to cues that cause inflammation. The amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ating proteins was reduced by culturing the cells without added serum and then sensitive mass spectrometry techniques were used to detect and quantify secretion of nearly 800 different proteins. Secretion was compared from cells lacking the signaling adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF, or both. Secretion of some proteins were regulated redundantly and were secreted without one of the adaptors, but others required both signals for release. Some anti-inflammatory proteins were released at later times in response to synergistic signals from both adaptor proteins, perhaps as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent excessive inflammation.</p></sec>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify the protein interactors of AGB1. After eliminating proteins present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants, and organellar proteins, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated proteins were confidently identified. We identified all of the G protein subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related proteins, and 14-3-3-like proteins, all of which may couple with or modulate G protein signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G protein-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G protein-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G proteins.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 25 distal tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es.   Of the distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   than in distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>ming a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-operation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 167 B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with revision   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-operation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, the treatment in 160 (95.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without revision. A total of 23 patients (14.4%) treated   with revision arthroplasty and two (28.6%) treated only with internal   fixation required re-operation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A significant proportion, particularly of B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, were   treated without revision of the stem. These were associated with   a higher rate of re-operation. The treatment of B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es without   revision of the stem resulted in a high rate of re-operation. This   demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation and accurate characterisation   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e at the time of presentation to ensure the correct   management. There is a need for improvement in the reporting of   data in case series recording the outcome of the surgical treatment   of periprosthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es.

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are a variant of tarsometatarsal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is reliable and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   Revisions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e but not of liner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.

The prevention of a lateral hinge fracture as a complication of a medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to investigate factors related to the technique of medial   opening wedge high tibial osteotomy which might predispose to the   development of a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 71 patients with 82 osteotomies were included in the   study. Their mean age was 62.9 years (37 to 80). The classification   of the type of osteotomy was based on whether it extended beyond   the fibular head. The level of the osteotomy was classified according   to the height of its endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 20 months (6 to 52), a total of 15 lateral   hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (18.3%) were identified.

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the proximal humerus. We divided   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es into three types: avulsion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> and   depression type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es is more reliable   than the Neer or AO classifications. These distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

Plate fixation <i>versus</i> intramedullary nailing of completely displaced midshaft fractures of the clavicle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the   functional outcomes of plate fixation and elastic stable intramedullary   nailing (ESIN) of completely displaced mid-shaft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the   clavicle in the active adult population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively recruited 123 patients and randomised them to   either plate fixation or ESIN. Patients completed the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one to six weeks post-operatively.   They were followed up at six weeks, three and six months and one   year with radiographs, and their clinical outcome was assessed using   both the DASH and the Constant Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Plate fixation provided a faster functional recovery during the   first six months compared with ESIN, but there was no difference   after one year. The duration of surgery was shorter for ESIN (mean   53.4 minutes, 22 to 120) than for plate fixation (mean 69.7 minutes,   35 to 106, p < 0.001). The recovery after ESIN was slower with   increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ion and with open reduction (p <   0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both methods return the patients to their pre-injury functional   levels, but plate fixation has a faster recovery period in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ed   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es than ESIN.

An evolution in the management of fractures of the ankle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There has been an evolution recently in the management of unstable   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the ankle with a trend towards direct fixation of a   posterior malleolar fragment. Within these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, Haraguchi   type 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es extend medially and often cannot be fixed using   a standard posterolateral approach. Our aim was to describe the   posteromedial approach to address these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and to assess   its efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med a review of 15 patients with a Haraguchi type 2   posterior malleolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e which was fixed using a posteromedial   approach. Five patients underwent initial temporary spanning external   fixation.

An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were managed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e management (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival.

The changing face of fractures of the hip in Northern Ireland
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We reviewed all patients who sustained a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the hip   and were treated in Northern Ireland over a period of 15 years to   identify trends in incidence, the demographics of the patients,   the rates of mortality, the configuration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e and the   choice of implant.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Since 01 January 2001 data about every <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the hip sustained   in an adult have been collected centrally in Northern Ireland.

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e   classification and operative information including weight-bearing   status, rates of union, re-operation, failure of implants and mortality   rate, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es were identified in 122 patients.

Long-term survival and risk factors for failure of the native hip joint after operatively treated displaced acetabular fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim in this study was to describe the long-term survival   of the native hip joint after open reduction and internal fixation   of a displaced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the acetabulum. We also present long-term   clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with a poor outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 285 patients underwent surgery for a displaced acetabular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e between 1993 and 2005. For the survival analysis 253 were   included, there were 197 men and 56 women with a mean age of 42   years (12 to 78). The mean follow-up of 11 years (1 to 20) was identified   from our pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e registry. There were 99 elementary and 154   associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e types. For the long-term clinical follow-up,   192 patients with complete data were included. Their mean age was   40 years (13 to 78) with a mean follow-up of 12 years (5 to 20).

There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible.

Single-cell profiling of the developing mouse brain and spinal cord with split-pool barcoding
<p>To facilitate scalable profiling of single cells, we developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq), a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method that labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial barcoding. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq is compatible with fixed cells or nuclei, allows efficient sample multiplexing, and requires no customized equipment. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.</p>

Increase in predator-prey size ratios throughout the Phanerozoic history of marine ecosystems
<p>The escalation hypothesis posits that predation by increasingly powerful and metabolically active carnivores has been a major driver of metazoan evolution. We test a key tenet of this hypothesis by analyzing predatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong> holes in fossil marine shells, which provide a ~500-million-year record of individual predator-prey interactions. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>-hole size is a robust predictor of body size among modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing predators and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>-hole size (and thus inferred predator size and power) rose substantially from the Ordovician to the Quaternary period, whereas the size of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ed prey remained stable. Together, these trends indicate a directional increase in predator-prey size ratios. We hypothesize that increasing predator-prey size ratios reflect increases in prey abundance, prey nutrient content, and predation among predators.</p>

The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This information can be used in the surgical planning   and operative reconstruction of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the proximal humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

Predictors of mortality following conservatively managed fractures of the odontoid in elderly patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rates of mortality as high as 25% to 30% have been described   following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the odontoid in the elderly population. The   aim of this study was to examine whether easily identifiable variables   present on admission are associated with mortality. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A consecutive series of 83 elderly patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of   the odontoid following a low-impact injury was identified retrospectively.

The impact of age on major orthopaedic trauma
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the early management and mortality of older patients   sustaining major orthopaedic trauma with that of a younger population   with similar injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Trauma Audit Research Network database was reviewed to identify   eligible patients admitted between April 2012 and June 2015. Distribution   and severity of injury, interventions, comorbidity, critical care   episodes and mortality were recorded. The population was divided   into young (64 years or younger) and older (65 years and older) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 142 765 adults sustaining major trauma, 72 942 (51.09 %) had   long bone or pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 45.81% of these were > 65 years   old. Road traffic collision was the most common mechanism in the   young (40.4%) and, in older people, fall from standing height (80.4%)   predominated. The 30 day mortality in older patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   is greater (6.8% <i>versus</i> 2.5%), although critical   care episodes are more common in the young (18.2% <i>versus</i> 9.7%).   Older people are less likely to be admitted to critical care beds   and are often managed in isolation by surgeons.

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> stress. We showed that fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flake</span></strong>s of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flake</span></strong>s into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>ting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>ting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect transistors, with single-atom thickness resolution.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>mance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> waves, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> waves that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> properties. However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> waves in the earthquake coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong>-wave speeds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong>ing auxetics that tile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong>s, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong>ing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Hip hemiarthroplasty is a standard treatment for intracapsular   proximal femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in the frail elderly. In this study we   have explored the implications of early return to theatre, within   30 days, on patient outcome following hip hemiarthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of all hip hemiarthroplasties   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med in our unit between January 2010 and January 2015. Demographic   details, medical backround, details of the primary procedure, complications,   subsequent procedures requiring return to theatre, re-admissions,   discharge destination and death were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 705 procedures were included; 428 Austin Moore and   277 Exeter Trauma Stems were used. A total of 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (in 33   patients) required early return to theatre within 30 days. Age,   gender, laterality, time from admission to primary procedure, American   Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and implant type were similar   for those requiring early return to theatre and those who did not.   Early return to theatre was associated with a significantly higher   length of stay (mean 33.6 days (7 to 107) <i>versus</i> 18.6   days (0 to 152), p < 0.001), re-admission rate (38.2% <i>versus</i> 8.6%,   p < 0.001), and subsequent revision rate (17.6% <i>versus</i> 1.3%,   p < 0.001). We found no difference in level of care required   on discharge or mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Proximal femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are common in the elderly population,   with far-reaching medical and economic implications. Factors such   as infection or dislocation may require early return to theatre,   and this is associated with outcomes which may be both medically   and economically detrimental. This illustrates the importance of   avoiding early complications to improve longer term outcome.</p><p>Return to theatre within 30 days is associated with longer length   of stay, higher re-admission rate, and higher subsequent revision   rate.

Cardiac disease and advanced age increase the mortality risk following surgery for periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e is a significant complication of total   hip and knee arthroplasty. This study aimed to describe the survival   of patients sustaining periprosthetic femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and compare   this with that of the general population, as well as to identify   the factors that influence survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 151 patients (women: men 116:35, mean age 74.6 years,   standard deviation 11.5) that sustained a periprosthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e   between January 2005 and October 2012 were retrospectively analysed.

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e in whom a CT scan was indicated.

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and arterial stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on arterial stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow stiffens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical testing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med under oscillatory and laminar wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong> stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-flow and stable flow were tested ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced arterial stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified transforming growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to transforming growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo testing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of transforming growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial stiffening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong>-mediated arterial stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit arterial stiffening and the progression of disease in arteries exposed to d-flow.</p></sec>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

A Trihelix Family Transcription Factor Is Associated with Key Genes in Mixed-Linkage Glucan Accumulation
<p>Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) is a polysaccharide that is highly abundant in grass endosperm cell walls and present at lower amounts in other tissues. <i>Cellulose synthase-like F</i> (<i>CSLF</i>) and <i>cellulose synthase-like H</i> genes synthesize MLG, but it is unknown if other genes participate in the production and restructuring of MLG. Using <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> transcriptional profiling data, we identified a <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> trihelix family transcription factor (<i>BdTHX1</i>) that is highly coexpressed with the <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon CSLF6</i> gene (<i>BdCSLF6</i>), which suggests that BdTHX1 is involved in the regulation of MLG biosynthesis. To determine the genes regulated by this transcription factor, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using immature <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> seeds and an anti-BdTHX1 polyclonal antibody. The ChIP-seq experiment identified the second intron of <i>BdCSLF6</i> as one of the most enriched sequences. The binding of BdTHX1 to the <i>BdCSLF6</i> intron sequence was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). ChIP-seq also showed that a gene encoding a grass-specific glycoside hydrolase family 16 endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<i>BdXTH8</i>) is bound by BdTHX1, and the binding was confirmed by EMSA. Radiochemical transglucanase assays showed that BdXTH8 exhibits predominantly MLG:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity, a hetero-transglycosylation reaction, and can thus produce MLG-xyloglucan covalent bonds; it also has a lower xyloglucan:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity. <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> shoots regenerated from transformed calli overexpressing <i>BdTHX1</i> showed an abnormal arrangement of vascular tissue and seedling-lethal phenotypes. These results indicate that the transcription factor BdTHX1 likely plays an important role in MLG biosynthesis and restructuring by regulating the expression of <i>BdCSLF6</i> and <i>BdXTH8</i>.</p>

Division Plane Orientation Defects Revealed by a Synthetic Double Mutant Phenotype
<p>TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOTS9 (AIR9) are microtubule-binding proteins that localize to the division site in plants. Their function in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) remained unclear because neither <i>tan1</i> nor <i>air9</i> single mutants have a strong phenotype. We show that <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have a synthetic phenotype consisting of short, twisted roots with disordered cortical microtubule arrays that are hypersensitive to a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. The <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have significant defects in division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientation due to failures in placing the new cell wall at the correct division site. Full-length TAN1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein, <i>TAN1-YFP</i>, and several deletion constructs were transformed into the double mutant to assess which regions of TAN1 are required for its function in root growth, root twisting, and division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientation. <i>TAN1-YFP</i> expressed in <i>tan1 air9</i> significantly rescued the double mutant phenotype in all three respects. Interestingly, TAN1 missing the first 126 amino acids, TAN1-ΔI-YFP, failed to rescue the double mutant phenotype, while TAN1 missing a conserved middle region, TAN1-ΔII-YFP, significantly rescued the mutant phenotype in terms of root growth and division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientation but not root twisting. We use the <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutant to discover new functions for TAN1 and AIR9 during phragmoplast guidance and root morphogenesis.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual genes. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Multivariable propensity-adjusted   logistic regressions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med to determine associations between early   surgery within 24 hours and post-operative complications, controlling   for selection bias in patients undergoing early surgery based on   observable characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 051 patients were included in the study; 5921 (22.7%)   had surgery within 24 hours of admission, while 20 130 (77.3%) patients   had surgery after 24 hours. Propensity-adjusted multivariable logistic   regressions demonstrated that surgery within 24 hours was independently   associated with lower odds of respiratory complications including   pneumonia, failure to extubate, or reintubation (odds ratio (OR)   0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.90), and extended length   of stay (LOS) defined as ≥ 6 days (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In elderly patients with hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, early surgery within   24 hours of admission is independently associated with less pulmonary   complications including pneumonia, failure to extubate, and reintubation,   as well as shorter LOS.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1216–22.</p></sec>

Mid-term outcomes of 77 modular radial head prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radial head arthroplasty (RHA) may be used in the treatment of   non-reconstructable radial head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es. The aim of this study   was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic results of   RHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 77 RHAs were implanted in 54 men and 23   women with either acute injuries (54) or with traumatic sequelae   (23) of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the radial head. Four designs of RHA were   used, including the Guepar (Small Bone Innovations (SBi)/Stryker;   36), Evolutive (Aston Medical; 24), rHead RECON (SBi/Stryker; ten)   or rHead STANDARD (SBi/Stryker; 7) prostheses. The mean follow-up   was 74.0 months (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 38.6; 24 to 141).   The indication for further surgery, range of movement, mean Mayo   Elbow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>mance (MEP) score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (quickDASH) score, osteolysis and positioning of the implant   were also assessed according to the design, and acute or delayed   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean MEP and quickDASH scores were 90.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 14;   45 to 100), and 14.0 points (<sc>sd</sc> 12; 1.2 to 52.5), respectively. There   were no significant differences between RHA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med in acute or   delayed fashion. There were 30 re-operations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-operative years.   Painful loosening was the primary indication for removal in 14 patients.   Short-stemmed prostheses (16 mm to 22 mm in length) were also associated   with an increased risk of painful loosening (odds ratio 3.54 (1.02   to 12.2), p = 0.045). Radiocapitellar instability was the primary   indication for re-operation with retention of the implant (5). The   overall survival of the RHA, free from re-operation, was 60.8% (<sc>sd</sc> 5.7%)   at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bipolar and press-fit RHA gives unsatisfactory mid-term outcomes   in the treatment of acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the radial head or their   sequelae. The outcome may vary according to the design of the implant.   The rate of re-operation during the first three years is predictive   of the long-term survival in tight-fitting RHAs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B1197–1203.</p></sec>

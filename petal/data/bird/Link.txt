The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>s GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events to successfully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> a cellular response. On average, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that are an order of magnitude longer than the average agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing dwell time distribution rather than its average properties.</p>

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple steroid ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to and regulate the activity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced activation or inhibition of MR activity, we studied the response to eight steroids (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d by the steroids, and others required higher steroid concentrations for activation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained activity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the activation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist activity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Analysis of Posttranslational Activation of Alternative Oxidase Isoforms
<p>Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) in plants is a non-proton-motive ubiquinol oxidase that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. A comparative analysis of the AOX isoenzymes AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) revealed that cysteine residues, CysI and CysII, are both involved in 2-oxo acid activation, with AOX1A activity being more increased by 2-oxo acids than that of AOX1C and AOX1D. Substitution of cysteine in AOX1A by glutamate mimicked its activation by pyruvate or glyoxylate, but not in AOX1C and AOX1D. CysIII, only present in AOX1A, is not involved in activation by reduction or metabolites, but substitutions at this position affected activity. AOX1A carrying a serine residue at position CysI was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d by succinate, while correspondingly substituted variants of AOX1C and AOX1D were insensitive. Activation by glutamate at CysI and CysII is consistent with the formation of the thiohemiacetal, while succinate activation after changing CysI to serine suggests hemiacetal formation. Surprisingly, in AOX1A, replacement of CysI by alanine, which cannot form a (thio)hemiacetal, led to even higher activities, pointing to an alternative mechanism of activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AOX isoforms are differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d and that activation at CysI and CysII is additive.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an activator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the activation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that activation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively active transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong activation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II activity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that activation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK activation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>s JNK upon Rok activation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that controls osteoclast activity and bone mass in vivo
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts is essential for bone homeostasis. The kinase Src promotes osteoclast activity and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d in osteoclasts by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. In other contexts, however, PTPROt can inhibit Src activity. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that PTPROt is bifunctional and can dephosphorylate Src both at its inhibitory residue Tyr<sup>527</sup> and its activating residue Tyr<sup>416</sup>. Whereas wild-type and PTPROt knockout mice exhibited similar bone masses, mice in which a putative C-terminal phosphorylation site, Tyr<sup>399</sup>, in endogenous PTPROt was replaced with phenylalanine had increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast activity. Osteoclasts from the knock-in mice also showed reduced Src activity. Experiments in cultured cells and in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains demonstrated that the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>399</sup> caused PTPROt to dephosphorylate Src at the activating site pTyr<sup>416</sup>. In contrast, phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> enabled PTPROt to recruit Src through Grb2 and to dephosphorylate Src at the inhibitory site Tyr<sup>527</sup>, thus stimulating Src activity. We conclude that reversible phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that selects between its opposing activities toward Src and maintains a coherent signaling output, and that blocking this phosphorylation event can induce physiological effects in vivo. Because most receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases contain potential phosphorylation sites at their C termini, we propose that preventing phosphorylation at these sites or its consequences may offer an alternative to inhibiting their catalytic activity to achieve therapeutic benefit.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate synapse formation and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

TGF-β promotes PI3K-AKT signaling and prostate cancer cell migration through the TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation of p85α
<p>Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) is a pluripotent cytokine that regulates cell fate and plasticity in normal tissues and tumors. The multifunctional cellular responses evoked by TGF-β are mediated by the canonical SMAD pathway and by noncanonical pathways, including mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. We found that TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d PI3K in a manner dependent on the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 polyubiquitylated the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α and promoted the formation of a complex between the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and p85α, which led to the activation of PI3K and AKT. Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked polyubiquitylation of p85α on Lys<sup>513</sup> and Lys<sup>519</sup> in the iSH2 (inter–Src homology 2) domain was required for TGF-β–induced activation of PI3K-AKT signaling and cell motility in prostate cancer cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d macrophages. Unlike the activation of SMAD pathways, the TRAF6-mediated activation of PI3K and AKT was not dependent on the kinase activity of TβRI. In situ proximity ligation assays revealed that polyubiquitylation of p85α was evident in aggressive prostate cancer tissues. Thus, our data reveal a molecular mechanism by which TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>s the PI3K-AKT pathway to drive cell migration.</p>

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, activity, or interaction partners. However, how this SUMO conjugation activity concentrates the proteins involved and the substrates into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the requirements for SUMO NB formation and for their subsequent colocalization with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a master regulator of plant growth. COP1 activity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation activity alone was sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO conjugation activity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 docks in the substrate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>s COP1 and SUMO conjugation activity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation stimulates COP1 activity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Loss and Gain of Human Acidic Mammalian Chitinase Activity by Nonsynonymous SNPs
<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is implicated in asthma, allergic inflammation, and food processing. Little is known about genetic and evolutional regulation of chitinolytic activity of AMCase. Here, we relate human AMCase polymorphisms to the mouse AMCase, and show that the highly active variants encoded by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are consistent with the mouse AMCase sequence. The chitinolytic activity of the recombinant human AMCase was significantly lower than that of the mouse counterpart. By creating mouse-human chimeric AMCase protein we found that the presence of the N-terminal region of human AMCase containing conserved active site residues reduced the enzymatic activity of the molecule. We were able to significantly increase the activity of human AMCase by amino acid substitutions encoded by nsSNPs (N45, D47, and R61) with those conserved in the mouse homologue (D45, N47, and M61). For abolition of the mouse AMCase activity, introduction of M61R mutation was sufficient. M61 is conserved in most of primates other than human and orangutan as well as in other mammals. Orangutan has I61 substitution, which also markedly reduced the activity of the mouse AMCase, indicating that the M61 is a crucial residue for the chitinolytic activity. Altogether, our data suggest that human AMCase has lost its chitinolytic activity by integration of nsSNPs during evolution and that the enzyme can be re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d by introducing amino acids conserved in the mouse counterpart.</p>

Development
Co-activation of microRNAs by Zelda is essential for early <i>Drosophila</i> development
<p>Transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two important classes of <i>trans</i>-regulators in differential gene expression. Transcription factors occupy <i>cis</i>-regulatory motifs in DNA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> or repress gene transcription, whereas miRNAs specifically pair with seed sites in target mRNAs to trigger mRNA decay or inhibit translation. Dynamic spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors and miRNAs during development point to their stage- and tissue-specific functions. Recent studies have focused on miRNA functions during development; however, much remains to explore regarding how the expression of miRNAs is initiated and how dynamic miRNA expression patterns are achieved by transcriptional regulatory networks at different developmental stages. Here, we focused on the identification, regulation and function of miRNAs during the earliest stage of <i>Drosophila</i> development, when the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) takes place. Eleven miRNA clusters comprise the first set of miRNAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d in the blastoderm embryo. The transcriptional activator Zelda is required for their proper activation and regulation, and Zelda <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing observed in genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing profiles is predictive of enhancer activity. In addition, other blastoderm transcription factors, comprising both activators and repressors, the activities of which are potentiated and coordinated by Zelda, contribute to the accurate temporal and spatial expression of these miRNAs, which are known to function in diverse developmental processes. Although previous genetic studies showed no early phenotypes upon loss of individual miRNAs, our analysis of the <i>miR-1; miR-9a</i> double mutant revealed defects in gastrulation, demonstrating the importance of co-activation of miRNAs by Zelda during the MZT.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the activity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity.

Targeting nucleotide exchange to inhibit constitutively active G protein α subunits in cancer cells
<p>Constitutively active G protein α subunits cause cancer, cholera, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other disorders. Therapeutic intervention by targeted inhibition of constitutively active Gα subunits in these disorders has yet to be achieved. We found that constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in uveal melanoma (UM) cells was inhibited by the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). FR allosterically inhibited guanosine diphosphate–for–guanosine triphosphate (GDP/GTP) exchange to trap constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in inactive, GDP-bound Gαβγ heterotrimers. Allosteric inhibition of other Gα subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site. In UM cells driven by constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub>, FR inhibited second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and stimulated apoptosis. In contrast, FR had no effect on <i>BRAF</i>-driven UM cells. FR promoted UM cell differentiation by reactivating polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)–mediated gene silencing, a heretofore unrecognized effector system of constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> in UM. Constitutively active Gα<sub>q</sub> and PRC2 therefore provide therapeutic targets for UM. The development of FR analogs specific for other Gα subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively active Gα subunits or multiple G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) where targeting a single receptor is ineffective.</p>

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G proteins would enable the manipulation of RGS-G protein interactions, explore their functions, and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS proteins are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered proteins exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS protein increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα proteins.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat

On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combine</span></strong>d stresses (i.e. common stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combine</span></strong>d stresses (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combine</span></strong>d stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">combine</span></strong>d. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress genes were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

AIK1, A Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Modulates Abscisic Acid Responses through the MKK5-MPK6 Kinase Cascade<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module involved in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus for appropriate cellular adjustment. This cascade essentially consists of three components: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ed to each other by the event of phosphorylation. Here, we report the characterization of a MAPKKK, ABA-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (AIK1), which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). T-DNA insertion mutants of AIK1 showed insensitivity to ABA in terms of both root growth and stomatal response. AIK1 functions in ABA responses via regulation of root cell division and elongation, as well as stomatal responses. The activity of AIK1 is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>), and the Arabidopsis protein phosphatase type 2C, ABI1, a negative regulator of ABA signaling, restricts AIK1 activity by dephosphorylation. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis showed that MPK3, MPK6, and AIK1 interact with MKK5. The single mutant seedlings of <i>mpk6</i> and <i>mkk5</i> have similar phenotypes to <i>aik1</i>, but <i>mkk4</i> does not. AIK1 was localized in the cytoplasm and shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> MKK5 by protein phosphorylation, which was an ABA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d process. Constitutively active MKK5 in <i>aik1</i> mutant seedlings complements the ABA-insensitive root growth phenotype of <i>aik1</i>. The activity of MPK6 was increased by ABA in wild-type seedlings, but its activation by ABA was impaired in <i>aik1</i> and <i>aik1 mkk5</i> mutants. These findings clearly suggest that the AIK1-MKK5-MPK6 cascade functions in the ABA regulation of primary root growth and stomatal response.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attach</span></strong>ment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants.

By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing without influencing gating. Channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exercise promotes metabolic remodeling in the heart, which is associated with physiological cardiac growth; however, it is not known whether or how physical activity–induced changes in cardiac metabolism cause myocardial remodeling. In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism are important for physiological cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, metabolomic, and biochemical assays to measure changes in myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic activity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, metabolism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. Metabolomic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify metabolic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic activity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase activity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional activation of the physiological cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase activity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, metabolic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase activity caused modest mitochondrial damage. Transcriptomic analyses showed that glycolysis regulates the expression of key genes involved in cardiac metabolism and remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Exercise-induced decreases in glycolytic activity stimulate physiological cardiac remodeling, and metabolic flexibility is important for maintaining mitochondrial health in the heart.</p></sec>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk.

MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt.

Phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) links energy sensing to anti-inflammatory signaling
<p>Adenosine 5′-monophosphate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d protein kinase (AMPK) is a pivotal regulator of metabolism at cellular and organismal levels. AMPK also suppresses inflammation. We found that pharmacological activation of AMPK rapidly inhibited the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in various cells. In vitro kinase assays revealed that AMPK directly phosphorylated two residues (Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup>) within the Src homology 2 domain of JAK1. Activation of AMPK enhanced the interaction between JAK1 and 14-3-3 proteins in cultured vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, an effect that required the presence of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> and was abolished in cells lacking AMPK catalytic subunits. Mutation of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> abolished AMPK-mediated inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling stimulated by either the sIL-6Rα/IL-6 complex or the expression of a constitutively active V658F-mutant JAK1 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Clinically used AMPK activators metformin and salicylate enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of endogenous JAK1 and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in primary vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, our findings reveal a mechanism by which JAK1 function and inflammatory signaling may be suppressed in response to metabolic stress and provide a mechanistic rationale for the investigation of AMPK activators in a range of diseases associated with enhanced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.</p>

Noncanonical NF-κB Activation by the Oncoprotein Tio Occurs Through a Nonconserved TRAF3-Binding Motif

Activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway blocks the constitutive degradation of the kinase NIK (NF-κB–inducing kinase), which leads to the generation of an NF-κB subunit required for target gene expression. The viral oncoprotein Tio mimics a constitutively active receptor upstream of NF-κB signaling, and de Jong <i>et al</i>. found that it contains a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motif not conserved in other proteins that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3), an inhibitor of noncanonical NF-κB signaling.

Tio signaling did not result in TRAF3 degradation; rather, it induced the sequestration of a TRAF3-containing degradative complex from NIK to stimulate the noncanonical pathway. These data suggest that Tio might be used as a tool to examine the specific activation of genes targeted by noncanonical NF-κB signaling in the context of viral transformation. </p></sec>

Transcriptional activation of elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor by corticosteroids, progesterone, and spironolactone
<p>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a nuclear receptor and part of a large and diverse family of transcription factors that also includes receptors for glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, and estrogens. The corticosteroid aldosterone is the physiological activator of the MR in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates; however, its activator is not known in cartilaginous fish, the oldest group of extant jawed vertebrates. Here, we analyzed the ability of corticosteroids and progesterone to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> the full-length MR from the elephant shark (<i>Callorhinchus milii</i>). On the basis of their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone, and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fish. Although progesterone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>s MRs in ray-finned fish, progesterone does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> MRs in humans, amphibians, or alligator, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> the MR.

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 activation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in activating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 activation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 stimulation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with activation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 activation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in activation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (NBD) and a substrate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (SBD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ed by a linker that couples the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the release of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker activity generates phasic contractions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract.

Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker activity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker activity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC activation. Blocking CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying current with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d current (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>). An inhibitory peptide that interfered with the STIM-Orai interaction blocked <i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub> in HEK 293 cells expressing STIM1 and Orai1 and blocked spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) and slow wave currents in ICC. STICs, which are fundamental pacemaker events in ICC, were blocked by an Orai antagonist. Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients linked to pacemaker activity in ICC in intact muscles showed that the Orai antagonist blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery through STIM-Orai interactions is necessary to maintain ICC pacemaker activity.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas activation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, activation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> T1R in the airway.

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with activating receptor signaling to induce NK cell activation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d immune cells.</p>

We found that the tyrosine kinase Src promoted the phosphorylation of TBK1 on Tyr<sup>179</sup> upon viral infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. Mutation of Tyr<sup>179</sup> to alanine resulted in impaired autophosphorylation of TBK1 at Ser<sup>172</sup>, which is required for TBK1 activation. The TBK1 Y179A mutant failed to rescue type I IFN production by virally infected RAW264.7 macrophages deficient in TBK1. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with AZD0530 and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9–mediated knockout of Src demonstrated that Src was critical for activating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway and stimulating type I IFN production. However, Src did not directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to recombinant TBK1 in vitro but instead bound to the proline-X-X-proline motifs within key PRR adaptor proteins, such as TRIF, MAVS, and STING, which formed complexes with TBK1 after PRR engagement. Together, our data suggest that Src is the major tyrosine kinase that primes TBK1 for autophosphorylation and activation, thus providing mechanistic insights into the regulation of TBK1 activity by various PRRs as part of the innate antiviral response.</p>

Functional degradation: A mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation by diverse pathogen enzymes
<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that initiate innate immunity by recruitment and activation of caspase-1. The NLRP1B inflammasome is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d upon direct cleavage by the anthrax lethal toxin protease. However, the mechanism by which cleavage results in NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we find that cleavage results in proteasome-mediated degradation of the amino-terminal domains of NLRP1B, liberating a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is a potent caspase-1 activator. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NLRP1B is both necessary and sufficient for NLRP1B activation. Consistent with our functional degradation model, we identify IpaH7.8, a <i>Shigella flexneri</i> ubiquitin ligase secreted effector, as an enzyme that induces NLRP1B degradation and activation. Our results provide a unified mechanism for NLRP1B activation by diverse pathogen-encoded enzymatic activities.</p>

A molecular assembly phase transition and kinetic proofreading modulate Ras activation by SOS
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (SOS) is a key Ras activator that is autoinhibited in the cytosol and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>s upon membrane recruitment. Autoinhibition release involves structural rearrangements of the protein at the membrane and thus introduces a delay between initial recruitment and activation. In this study, we designed a single-molecule assay to resolve the time between initial receptor-mediated membrane recruitment and the initiation of GEF activity of individual SOS molecules on microarrays of Ras-functionalized supported membranes. The rise-and-fall shape of the measured SOS activation time distribution and the long mean time scale to activation (~50 seconds) establish a basis for kinetic proofreading in the receptor-mediated activation of Ras. We further demonstrate that this kinetic proofreading is modulated by the LAT (linker for activation of T cells)–Grb2–SOS phosphotyrosine-driven phase transition at the membrane.</p>

Lysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that quiescent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d NSCs exhibited differences in their protein homeostasis network. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d NSCs had active proteasomes, quiescent NSCs contained large lysosomes.

During aging, quiescent NSCs displayed defects in their lysosomes, increased accumulation of protein aggregates, and reduced ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>.

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive

Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency.

Thus, the activity of dehydration-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

The MAPK Kinase Kinase GmMEKK1 Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses
<p>MAPK signaling pathways play critical roles in plant immunity. Here, we silenced multiple genes encoding MAPKs using virus-induced gene silencing mediated by <i>Bean pod mottle virus</i> to identify MAPK genes involved in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) immunity. Surprisingly, a strong hypersensitive response (HR) cell death was observed when soybean <i>MAPK KINASE KINASE1</i> (<i>GmMEKK1</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>MEKK1</i>, was silenced. The HR was accompanied by the overaccumulation of defense signaling molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide. Genes involved in primary metabolism, translation/transcription, photosynthesis, and growth/development were down-regulated in <i>GmMEKK1-</i>silenced plants, while the expression of defense-related genes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d. Accordingly, <i>GmMEKK1</i>-silenced plants were more resistant to downy mildew (<i>Peronospora manshurica</i>) and <i>Soybean mosaic virus</i> compared with control plants. Silencing <i>GmMEKK1</i> reduced the activation of GmMPK6 but enhanced the activation of <i>Gm</i>MPK3 in response to flg22 peptide. Unlike Arabidopsis MPK4, <i>Gm</i>MPK4 was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d by either flg22 or SA. Interestingly, transient overexpression of <i>GmMEKK1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> also induced HR. Our results indicate that <i>Gm</i>MEKK1 plays both positive and negative roles in immunity and appears to differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> downstream MPKs by promoting <i>Gm</i>MPK6 activation but suppressing GmMPK3 activation in response to flg22. The involvement of <i>Gm</i>MPK4 kinase activity in cell death and in flg22- or SA-triggered defense responses in soybean requires further investigation.</p>

Multiplex Fluorescent, Activity-Based Protein Profiling Identifies Active α-Glycosidases and Other Hydrolases in Plants
<p>With nearly 140 α-glycosidases in 14 different families, plants are well equipped with enzymes that can break the α-glucosidic bonds in a large diversity of molecules. Here, we introduce activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of α-glycosidases in plants using α-configured cyclophellitol aziridine probes carrying various fluorophores or biotin. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), these probes label members of the GH31 family of glycosyl hydrolases, including endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidase-II Radial Swelling3/Priority for Sweet Life5 (RSW3/PSL5) and Golgi-resident α-mannosidase-II Hybrid Glycosylation1 (HGL1), both of which trim <i>N</i>-glycans on glycoproteins. We detected the active state of extracellular α-glycosidases such as α-xylosidase XYL1, which acts on xyloglucans in the cell wall to promote cell expansion, and α-glucosidase AGLU1, which acts in starch hydrolysis and can suppress fungal invasion. Labeling of α-glycosidases generates pH-dependent signals that can be suppressed by α-glycosidase inhibitors in a broad range of plant species. To demonstrate its use on a nonmodel plant species, we applied ABPP on saffron crocus (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), a cash crop for the production of saffron spice. Using a combination of biotinylated glycosidase probes, we identified and quantified 67 active glycosidases in saffron crocus stigma, of which 10 are differentially active. We also uncovered massive changes in hydrolase activities in the corms upon infection with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> using multiplex fluorescence labeling in combination with probes for serine hydrolases and cysteine proteases. These experiments demonstrate the ease with which active α-glycosidases and other hydrolases can be analyzed through ABPP in model and nonmodel plants.</p>

BEND6 is a nuclear antagonist of Notch signaling during self-renewal of neural stem cells
<p>The activity of the Notch pathway revolves around a CSL-class transcription factor, which recruits distinct complexes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> or repress target gene expression. The co-activator complex is deeply conserved and includes the cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Mastermind. By contrast, numerous CSL co-repressor proteins have been identified, and these are mostly different between invertebrate and vertebrate systems. In this study, we demonstrate that mammalian BEND6 is a neural BEN-solo factor that shares many functional attributes with <i>Drosophila</i> Insensitive, a co-repressor for the <i>Drosophila</i> CSL factor. BEND6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s the mammalian CSL protein CBF1 and antagonizes Notch-dependent target activation. In addition, its association with Notch- and CBF1-regulated enhancers is promoted by CBF1 and antagonized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d Notch. <i>In utero</i> electroporation experiments showed that ectopic BEND6 inhibited Notch-mediated self-renewal of neocortical neural stem cells and promoted neurogenesis. Conversely, knockdown of BEND6 increased NSC self-renewal in wild-type neocortex, and exhibited genetic interactions with gain and loss of Notch pathway activity. We recapitulated all of these findings in cultured neurospheres, in which overexpression and depletion of BEND6 caused reciprocal effects on neural stem cell renewal and neurogenesis. These data reveal a novel mammalian CSL co-repressor in the nervous system, and show that the Notch-inhibitory activity of certain BEN-solo proteins is conserved between flies and mammals.</p>

Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 induce hydrocephalus in a catalytically dependent manner
<p>Catalytically activating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i>, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas inactivating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i> are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but distinct, developmental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease mutations are gain-of-function mutations because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic activity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated mutations on the development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a <i>Ptpn11</i> allele encoding the active SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K mutation were suppressed by the additional mutation C459S, which abolished the catalytic activity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the inactive SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected. Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced developmental defects in ependymal cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription activator STAT3. Whereas STAT3 activity was reduced in <i>Ptpn11</i><sup><i>E76K/+</i></sup> cells, the activities of the kinases ERK and AKT were enhanced, and neural cell–specific <i>Stat3</i> knockout mice also manifested developmental defects in ependymal cells and cilia. These genetic and biochemical data demonstrate a catalytic-dependent role of SHP2 gain-of-function disease mutants in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.</p>

Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells
<p>The retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological processes. To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream activation sequence–green fluorescent protein (UAS-GFP) reporter mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed reporter activity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. Reporter activity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)–induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d Gal4-UAS reporter cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of reporter activation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA reporter activity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced reporter activity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA ligands. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand that was greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together, these data suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.</p>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p>Acidic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly acidic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> PhoP in mildly acidic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> PhoP under mildly acidic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP activation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to acidic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly acidic pH, PhoP activation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

Protein kinase N3 promotes bone resorption by osteoclasts in response to Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling
<p>Cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts to form actin rings is necessary for these cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attach</span></strong> to bone and resorb bone matrices. We delineated the pathway through which Wnt5a signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) promoted the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts.

Subsequently, the Rho effector kinase Pkn3 bound to and enhanced the activity of c-Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is critical for actin ring formation. Mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in <i>Ror2</i> (<i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup>) had increased bone mass. Osteoclasts derived from these mice exhibited impaired bone resorption and actin ring formation, defects that were rescued by overexpression of constitutively active RhoA. These osteoclasts also exhibited reduced interaction between c-Src and Pkn3 and reduced c-Src kinase activity. Similar to <i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup> mice, mice with a global deficiency of <i>Pkn3</i> (<i>Pkn3</i><sup>−/−</sup>) had increased bone mass. The proline-rich region and kinase domain of Pkn3 were required to restore the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts derived from <i>Pkn3</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice.

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the immunological synapse.</p>

Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>–EP2–NF-κB signaling in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for intracranial aneurysms
<p>Intracranial aneurysms are common but are generally untreated, and their rupture can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because of the poor prognosis associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, preventing the progression of intracranial aneurysms is critically important. Intracranial aneurysms are caused by chronic inflammation of the arterial wall due to macrophage infiltration triggered by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage activation mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and inflammatory signaling involving prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin E receptor subtype 2 (EP2). We correlated EP2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with macrophage infiltration in human intracranial aneurysm lesions. Monitoring the spatiotemporal pattern of NF-κB activation during intracranial aneurysm development in mice showed that NF-κB was first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d in macrophages in the adventitia and in endothelial cells and, subsequently, in the entire arterial wall. Mice with a macrophage-specific deletion of <i>Ptger2</i> (which encodes EP2) or macrophage-specific expression of an IκBα mutant that restricts NF-κB activation had fewer intracranial aneurysms with reduced macrophage infiltration and NF-κB activation. In cultured cells, EP2 signaling cooperated with tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong> NF-κB and synergistically induce the expression of proinflammatory genes, including <i>Ptgs2</i> (encoding COX-2). EP2 signaling also stabilized <i>Ccl2</i> (encoding MCP-1) by activating the RNA-stabilizing protein HuR. Rats administered an EP2 antagonist had reduced macrophage infiltration and intracranial aneurysm formation and progression. This signaling pathway in macrophages thus facilitates intracranial aneurysm development by amplifying inflammation in intracranial arteries. These results indicate that EP2 antagonists may therefore be a therapeutic alternative to surgery.</p>

Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation by PKA stimulates the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia and diabetes
<p>Hypercontractility of arterial myocytes and enhanced vascular tone during diabetes are, in part, attributed to the effects of increased glucose (hyperglycemia) on L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. In murine arterial myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity in response to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel pore-forming subunit (α1<sub>C</sub>) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity were associated with PKA activity, leading to α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup>. Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)–fed mice and nondiabetic patients, arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice and from diabetic patients had increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity. Arterial myocytes and arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> PKA did not exhibit increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin mice expressing a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with Ser<sup>1928</sup> mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the HFD-induced increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup> in stimulating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity and vasoconstriction by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to increased glucose and in diabetes.</p>

Embryonic neural activity wires the brain
<p>The development of many sensory systems commonly involves patterned spontaneous activity of neurons, in which nearby neurons fire synchronously, forming waves of activity that propagate throughout a neural circuit. In concert with sensory experience and molecular factors, patterned spontaneous activity is critical for the formation of sensory maps, which are spatial representations in the brain of the sensory features they encode. The initial establishment of sensory maps is thought to be driven by molecular cues and later refined by neural activity, initially through patterned spontaneous activity and later by sensory-evoked activity. On page 987 of this issue, Antón-Bolaños <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the mouse whisker system to show that at the earliest stages of innervation to the cortex during brain development, patterned spontaneous activity is required for the formation of functional sensory maps.</p>

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>s innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activate</span></strong>d. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase separation by increasing the valencies of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase separation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA phase separation. These results demonstrated that the DNA-induced phase transition of cGAS promotes cGAMP production and innate immune signaling.</p>

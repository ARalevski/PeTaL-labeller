Existence, Functional Impairment, and Lung Repair Potential of Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells in Oxygen-Induced Arrested Alveolar Growth
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening diseases resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Human fetal and neonatal rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth–arrested rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human cord blood–derived ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> function, alveolar and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored. Low ECFC engraftment and the protective effect of cell-free ECFC-derived conditioned media suggest a paracrine effect. Long-term (10 months) assessment of ECFC therapy showed no adverse effects with persistent improvement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> structure, exercise capacity, and pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Impaired ECFC function may contribute to arrested alveolar growth.

Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein KLEIP regulates late-stage pulmonary maturation via Hif-2α in mice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory distress syndrome (RDS) caused by preterm delivery is a major clinical problem with limited mechanistic insight. Late-stage embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development is driven by hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors Hif-1α and Hif-2α, which act as important regulators for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development. Expression of the BTB-and kelch-domain-containing (BTB-kelch) protein KLEIP (Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein; also named Klhl20) is controlled by two hypoxia response elements, and KLEIP regulates stabilization and transcriptional activation of Hif-2α. Based on the available data, we hypothesized an essential role for KLEIP in murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development and function. Therefore, we have performed a functional, histological, mechanistic and interventional study in embryonic and neonatal <i>KLEIP</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Here, we show that about half of the <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates die due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory failure that is caused by insufficient aeration, reduced septal thinning, reduced glycogenolysis, type II pneumocyte immaturity and reduced surfactant production. Expression analyses in embryonic day (E) 18.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s identified KLEIP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> capillaries, and showed strongly reduced mRNA and protein levels for Hif-2α and VEGF; such reduced levels are associated with embryonic endothelial cell apoptosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> bleedings. Betamethasone injection in pregnant females prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory failure in <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates, normalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> maturation, vascularization, aeration and function, and increased neonatal Hif-2α expression. Thus, the experimental study shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory failure in <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates is determined by insufficient angiocrine Hif-2α–VEGF signaling and that betamethasone activates this newly identified signaling cascade in late-stage embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development.</p>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s (n=4).

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation.</p>

The balance between immunity and inflammation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s execute two critical functions that can be at odds with one another: eliminating harmful toxins, particulates, and microbes; and exchanging gas through uninflamed structures—alveoli—to collect oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s have a multilayered response to unwanted invaders, offering physical barriers as well as arranging immune cells at airway surfaces. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s have the “Goldilocks” challenge of deploying this armory with just the right amount of inflammation. Consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> immunity must be choreographed so that invaders are purged quickly, inflammation tempered, and homeostasis preserved. In this issue, two papers reveal how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> immunity handles these tasks and what happens when things go awry. Shlezinger <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) on page 1037 unveil a clever trick that neutrophils play on inhaled fungal spores to resist life-threatening infections. This may reveal new treatment strategies. On page 1014, Sinclair <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report metabolic derangements in dendritic cells (DCs) that reprogram the allergic response to inhaled particulates, with implications for asthma.</p>

Temporal and spatial patterns of internal and external stem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a sub-Mediterranean oak
<p>To accurately estimate stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation (<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>), measurements of both carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux to the atmosphere (<i>E</i><sub>A</sub>) and internal CO<sub>2</sub> flux through xylem (<i>F</i><sub>T</sub>) are needed because xylem sap transports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ed CO<sub>2</sub> upward. However, reports of seasonal dynamics of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, temperature, sap flow and shoot water potential, were measured in <i>Quercus pyrenaica</i> Willd. in four measurement campaigns during one growing season. Substantial daytime depressions in temperature-normalized <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> were observed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel hysteresis between stem temperature and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the transpiration stream. Low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> throughout the growing season, and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> was mainly explained by <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> (>90%). Internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] was found to vary vertically along the stems. Seasonality in resistance to radial CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion was related to shoot water potential. The low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> observed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in response to a legacy of coppicing as well as high radial diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low water content of stems.

MEG3-4 is a miRNA decoy that regulates IL-1β abundance to initiate and then limit inflammation to prevent sepsis during lung infection
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of lncRNAs in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s. We identified the lncRNA MEG3 as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses during bacterial infection. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3, transcript 4 (referred to as MEG3-4) encodes the isoform with the lowest abundance in mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA miR-138 in a competitive manner with mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby increasing IL-1β abundance and intensifying inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in alveolar macrophages and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> epithelial cells in culture and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> tissue in mice. MEG3-4–mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 abundance and inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 abundance tempered proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial infection, preventing the progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of immune response genes, extending the decoy and sponge mechanism associated with lncRNAs to antibacterial immunity, which affects both response and disease progression.</p>

Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks
<p>Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell signaling pathways somehow integrate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer cell lines compared to normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, integrative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered network (CFN) approach revealed that cell signaling pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then integrated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell signaling pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell signaling pathways in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer cells that were not present in normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive “OR” gates determine a large number of signal transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings reveal that cell signaling pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated immunosuppression model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant transplant immunosuppression model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were immunosuppressed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant immunosuppression model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with immunosuppression using hydrocortisone only. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

KIF22 coordinates CAR and EGFR dynamics to promote cancer cell proliferation
<p>The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a transmembrane receptor that plays a key role in cell-cell adhesion. CAR is found in normal epithelial cells and is increased in abundance in various human tumors, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> carcinomas. We investigated the potential mechanisms by which CAR contributes to cancer cell growth and found that depletion of CAR in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer cells reduced anchorage-independent growth, epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent proliferation, and tumor growth in vivo. EGF induced the phosphorylation of CAR and its subsequent relocalization to cell junctions through the activation of the kinase PKCδ. EGF promoted the binding of CAR to the chromokinesin KIF22. KIF22-dependent regulation of microtubule dynamics led to delayed EGFR internalization, enhanced EGFR signaling, and coordination of CAR dynamics at cell-cell junctions. These data suggest a role for KIF22 in the coordination of membrane receptors and provide potential new therapeutic strategies to combat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> tumor growth.</p>

<p>The use of potent therapies inhibiting critical oncogenic pathways active in epithelial cancers has led to multiple resistance mechanisms, including the development of highly aggressive, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC). SCNC patients have a dismal prognosis due in part to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving this malignancy and the lack of effective treatments. Here, we demonstrate that a common set of defined oncogenic drivers reproducibly reprograms normal human prostate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> epithelial cells to small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) and small cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer (SCLC), respectively. We identify shared active transcription factor binding regions in the reprogrammed prostate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> SCNCs by integrative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes. These results suggest that neuroendocrine cancers arising from distinct epithelial tissues may share common vulnerabilities that could be exploited for the development of drugs targeting SCNCs.</p>

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils
<p>Bone marrow–derived myeloid cells can accumulate within tumors and foster cancer outgrowth. Local immune-neoplastic interactions have been intensively investigated, but the contribution of the systemic host environment to tumor growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show in mice and cancer patients (<i>n</i> = 70) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> adenocarcinomas increase bone stromal activity in the absence of bone metastasis. Animal studies reveal that the cancer-induced bone phenotype involves bone-resident osteocalcin-expressing (Ocn<sup>+</sup>) osteoblastic cells. These cells promote cancer by remotely supplying a distinct subset of tumor-infiltrating SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils, which exhibit cancer-promoting properties. Experimentally reducing Ocn<sup>+</sup> cell numbers suppresses the neutrophil response and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> tumor outgrowth. These observations posit osteoblasts as remote regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer and identify SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils as myeloid cell effectors of the osteoblast-driven protumoral response.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale mold conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human mold pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>.</p>

Impaired Mitochondrial Transcription Termination Disrupts the Stromal Redox Poise in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the metabolite exchange between chloroplast and mitochondria ensures efficient photosynthesis under saturating light conditions. The <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant <i>stm6</i> is devoid of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor MOC1 and aberrantly expresses the mitochondrial genome, resulting in enhanced photosynthetic hydrogen production and diminished light tolerance. We analyzed the modulation of mitochondrial and chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation during the acclimation of <i>stm6</i> and the <i>MOC1</i>-complemented strain to excess light. Although light stress stimulated mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation via the energy-conserving cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway in both strains, the mutant was unable to fine-tune the expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation complex I in excess light, which was accompanied by an increased mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation via the alternative oxidase pathway. Furthermore, <i>stm6</i> failed to fully activate chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and cyclic electron flow due to a more oxidized state of the chloroplast stroma, which is caused by an increased mitochondrial electron sink capacity. Increased susceptibility to photoinhibition of PSII in <i>stm6</i> demonstrates that the MOC1-dependent modulation of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation helps control the stromal redox poise as a crucial part of high-light acclimation in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

Targeting NOTCH activation in small cell lung cancer through LSD1 inhibition
<p>Small cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) inhibitors were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the <i>NOTCH1</i> locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 inhibitor reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological inhibitor-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001–induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 inhibitors function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.</p>

MEK inhibitor trametinib does not prevent the growth of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)–addicted neuroblastomas
<p>Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several inhibitors targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or polyagent therapies for patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK inhibitor trametinib, which is included as a rational polytherapy strategy for treating EML4-ALK–positive, EGFR-activated, or KRAS-mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancers and neuroblastomas that also contain activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In addition, in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate of mutations in <i>ALK</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, leading to increased activation of RAS-MAPK signaling. Co-targeting ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attractive option, because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to MEK-ERK pathway inhibition by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with trametinib showed increased activation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2–associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival and proliferation that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice, trametinib inhibited the growth of EML4-ALK–positive non–small cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our results advise against the seemingly rational option of using MEK inhibitors to treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.</p>

Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation
<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the control of histone modification and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of CBP reduced the extent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14) stabilized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the stability of CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14. Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and attenuated LPS-stimulated histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms through which CBP stability is regulated by FBXL19 and USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes.</p>

Two distinct interstitial macrophage populations coexist across tissues in specific subtissular niches

NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination
<p>Molecularly targeted therapies aim to obstruct cell autonomous programs required for tumor growth. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors act in combination to suppress the proliferation of KRAS-mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer cells while simultaneously provoking a natural killer (NK) cell surveillance program leading to tumor cell death. The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components tumor necrosis factor–α and intercellular adhesion molecule–1 are required for NK cell surveillance of drug-treated tumor cells, which contributes to tumor regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> cancer mouse model. Therefore, molecularly targeted agents capable of inducing senescence can produce tumor control through non–cell autonomous mechanisms involving NK cell surveillance.</p>

Viscous control of cellular respiration by membrane lipid composition

Single-cell Wnt signaling niches maintain stemness of alveolar type 2 cells
<p>Alveoli, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory units, are tiny sacs where oxygen enters the bloodstream. They are lined by flat alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, which mediate gas exchange, and AT2 cells, which secrete surfactant. Rare AT2s also function as alveolar stem cells. We show that AT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> stem cells display active Wnt signaling, and many of them are near single, Wnt-expressing fibroblasts. Blocking Wnt secretion depletes these stem cells. Daughter cells leaving the Wnt niche transdifferentiate into AT1s: Maintaining Wnt signaling prevents transdifferentiation, whereas abrogating Wnt signaling promotes it. Injury induces AT2 autocrine Wnts, recruiting “bulk” AT2s as progenitors. Thus, individual AT2 stem cells reside in single-cell fibroblast niches providing juxtacrine Wnts that maintain them, whereas injury induces autocrine Wnts that transiently expand the progenitor pool. This simple niche maintains the gas exchange surface and is coopted in cancer.</p>

mTOR regulates metabolic adaptation of APCs in the lung and controls the outcome of allergic inflammation
<p>Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) occupy diverse anatomical tissues, but their tissue-restricted homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, working with mouse models of inflammation, we found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–dependent metabolic adaptation was required at discrete locations. mTOR was dispensable for dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis in secondary lymphoid tissues but necessary to regulate cellular metabolism and accumulation of CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and alveolar macrophages in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>. Moreover, while numbers of mTOR-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs were not changed, they were metabolically reprogrammed to skew allergic inflammation from eosinophilic T helper cell 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) to neutrophilic T<sub>H</sub>17 polarity. The mechanism for this change was independent of translational control but dependent on inflammatory DCs, which produced interleukin-23 and increased fatty acid oxidation. mTOR therefore mediates metabolic adaptation of APCs in distinct tissues, influencing the immunological character of allergic inflammation.</p>

Local amplifiers of IL-4Rα–mediated macrophage activation promote repair in lung and liver

In the peritoneal cavity and liver, C1q enhancement of type 2 macrophage activation was required for liver repair after bacterial infection, but resulted in fibrosis after peritoneal dialysis. IL-4 drives production of these structurally related defense collagens, SP-A and C1q, and the expression of their receptor, myosin 18A. These findings reveal the existence within different tissues of an amplification system needed for local type 2 responses.</p>

On the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration in Cyanobacteria

All members of the <i>Melainabacteria</i> and <i>Sericytochromatia</i> lack photosynthetic machinery, indicating that phototrophy was not an ancestral feature of the Cyanobacteria and that <i>Oxyphotobacteria</i> acquired the genes for photosynthesis relatively late in cyanobacterial evolution.

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Acclimation to High CO<sub>2</sub> Requires the <i>ω</i> Subunit of the RNA Polymerase in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Inactivation of the nonessential ω-subunit of the RNA polymerase core in the ΔrpoZ strain of the model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 leads to a unique high-CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive phenotype. Supplementing air in the growth chamber with 30 mL L<sup>−1</sup> (3%) CO<sub>2</sub> accelerated the growth rate of the control strain (CS) 4-fold, whereas ΔrpoZ did not grow faster than under ambient air. The slow growth of ΔrpoZ during the first days in high CO<sub>2</sub> was due to the inability of the mutant cells to adjust photosynthesis to high CO<sub>2</sub>. The light-saturated photosynthetic activity of ΔrpoZ in high CO<sub>2</sub> was only half of that measured in CS, Rubisco content was one-third lower, and cells of ΔrpoZ were not able to increase light-harvesting phycobilisome antenna like CS upon high-CO<sub>2</sub> treatment. In addition, altered structural and functional organization of photosystem I and photosystem II were detected in the ΔrpoZ strain compared with CS when cells were grown in high CO<sub>2</sub> but not in ambient air. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation of ΔrpoZ did not acclimate to high CO<sub>2</sub>. Unlike the photosynthetic complexes, the RNA polymerase complex and ribosomes were produced in high CO<sub>2</sub> similarly as in CS. Our results indicate that the deletion of the ω-subunit specifically affects photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation, but transcription and translation remain active. Thus, the specific effect of the ω-subunit on photosynthesis but not on all household processes suggests that the ω-subunit might have a regulatory function in cyanobacteria.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Cathepsin G Controls Arterial But Not Venular Myeloid Cell Recruitment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Therapeutic targeting of arterial leukocyte recruitment in the context of atherosclerosis has been disappointing in clinical studies. Reasons for such failures include the lack of knowledge of arterial-specific recruitment patterns. Here we establish the importance of the cathepsin G (CatG) in the context of arterial myeloid cell recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Intravital microscopy of the carotid artery, the jugular vein, and cremasteric arterioles and venules in <i>Apoe</i><sup><i>–/–</i></sup>and CatG-deficient mice (<i>Apoe</i><sup><i>–/–</i></sup><i>Ctsg</i><sup><i>–/–</i></sup>) was used to study site-specific myeloid cell behavior after high-fat diet feeding or tumor necrosis factor stimulation. Atherosclerosis development was assessed in aortic root sections after 4 weeks of high-fat diet, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> inflammation was assessed after inhalation of lipopolysaccharide. Endothelial deposition of CatG and CCL5 was quantified in whole-mount preparations using 2-photon and confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Our observations elucidated a crucial role for CatG during arterial leukocyte adhesion, an effect not found during venular adhesion. Consequently, CatG deficiency attenuates atherosclerosis but not acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> inflammation. Mechanistically, CatG is immobilized on arterial endothelium where it activates leukocytes to firmly adhere engaging integrin clustering, a process of crucial importance to achieve effective adherence under high-shear flow. Therapeutic neutralization of CatG specifically abrogated arterial leukocyte adhesion without affecting myeloid cell adhesion in the microcirculation. Repetitive application of CatG-neutralizing antibodies permitted inhibition of atherogenesis in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Taken together, these findings present evidence of an arterial-specific recruitment pattern centered on CatG-instructed adhesion strengthening. The inhibition of this process could provide a novel strategy for treatment of arterial inflammation with limited side effects.</p></sec>

Activation of Lung p53 by Nutlin-3a Prevents and Reverses Experimental Pulmonary Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Induction of cellular senescence through activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is a new option for treating proliferative disorders. Nutlins prevent the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (murine double minute 2), a negative p53 regulator, from interacting with p53. We hypothesized that cell senescence induced by Nutlin-3a exerted therapeutic effects in pulmonary hypertension (PH) by limiting the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Nutlin-3a treatment of cultured human PA-SMCs resulted in cell growth arrest with the induction of senescence but not apoptosis; increased phosphorylated p53 protein levels; and expression of p53 target genes including p21, Bax, BTG2, and MDM2. Daily intraperitoneal Nutlin-3a treatment for 3 weeks dose-dependently reduced PH, right ventricular hypertrophy, and distal pulmonary artery muscularization in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia or SU5416/hypoxia. Nutlin-3a treatment also partially reversed PH in chronically hypoxic or transgenic mice overexpressing the serotonin-transporter in SMCs (SM22-5HTT+ mice). In these mouse models of PH, Nutlin-3a markedly increased senescent p21-stained PA-SMCs; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> p53, p21, and MDM2 protein levels; and p21, Bax, PUMA, BTG2, and MDM2 mRNA levels; but induced only minor changes in control mice without PH. Marked MDM2 immunostaining was seen in both mouse and human remodeled pulmonary vessels, supporting the use of Nutlins as a PH-targeted therapy. PH prevention or reversal by Nutlin-3a required <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> p53 stabilization and increased p21 expression, as indicated by the absence of Nutlin-3a effects in hypoxia-exposed p53<sup>−/−</sup> and p21<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Nutlin-3a may hold promise as a prosenescence treatment targeting PA-SMCs in PH.</p></sec>

The secondary aims were to identify predictors of satisfaction   at one year, persistence of patient dissatisfaction, and late onset   dissatisfaction in patients that were originally satisfied at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective cohort consisting of 1369 patients undergoing   a primary TKA for osteoarthritis that had not undergone revision   were identified from an established arthroplasty database. Patient   demographics, comorbidities, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities   Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire   scores were collected preoperatively, and one and five years postoperatively.   In addition, patient satisfaction was assessed at one and five years   postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify   independent predictors of satisfaction at one and five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall rate of satisfaction did not change from one (91.7%,   n = 1255) to five (90.1%, n = 1234) years (p = 0.16).

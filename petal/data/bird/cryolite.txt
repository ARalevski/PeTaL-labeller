Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and the control that the leaf exerts over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution that is preserved in different environments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e ion batteries are potential “next-generation” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operation at high temperatures because suitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e ion–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e ion–conducting electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorination and defluorination reactions in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e ion electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e ion–mediated electrochemistry offers a pathway toward developing capacities beyond that of lithium ion technology.</p>

Fractal-like hierarchical organization of bone begins at the nanoscale
<p>The components of bone assemble hierarchically to provide stiffness and toughness. However, the organization and relationship between bone’s principal components—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al and collagen—has not been clearly elucidated. Using three-dimensional electron tomography imaging and high-resolution two-dimensional electron microscopy, we demonstrate that bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al is hierarchically assembled beginning at the nanoscale: Needle-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al units merge laterally to form platelets, and these are further organized into stacks of roughly parallel platelets. These stacks coalesce into aggregates that exceed the lateral dimensions of the collagen fibrils and span adjacent fibrils as continuous, cross-fibrillar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization. On the basis of these observations, we present a structural model of hierarchy and continuity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al phase, which contributes to the structural integrity of bone.</p>

Altered DNA Methylation of Long Noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Promotes Mineralization by Silencing <i>NOTCH1</i>
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcific aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of <i>NOTCH1</i>, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn concentrations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this concentration inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al nutrition.</p>

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-strength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> alloys are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-strength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> alloys require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of solute clusters. This results in better material strength and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones. These alloys are therefore likely to be more resistant to damage.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong>–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode corrosion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most corrosion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit corrosion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong>–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in corrosion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

A catalytic fluoride-rebound mechanism for C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-CF<sub>3</sub> bond formation
<p>The biological properties of trifluoromethyl compounds have led to their ubiquity in pharmaceuticals, yet their chemical properties have made their preparation a substantial challenge, necessitating innovative chemical solutions.

This feature, combined with the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e-rebound” mechanism, was translated into a protocol for the synthesis of <sup>18</sup>F-radiolabeled aliphatic CF<sub>3</sub>-containing compounds, enabling the preparation of potential tracers for use in positron emission tomography.</p>

Biological control of aragonite formation in stony corals
<p>Little is known about how stony corals build their calcareous skeletons. There are two prevailing hypotheses: that it is a physicochemically dominated process and that it is a biologically mediated one. Using a combination of ultrahigh-resolution three<i>-</i>dimensional imaging and two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al deposition is biologically driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic precipitation of aragonite.</p>

Transformation of bulk alloys to oxide nanowires

We show the transformation of multimicrometer-sized particles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> or magnesium alloys into alkoxide nanowires of tunable dimensions, which are converted into oxide nanowires upon heating in air.

Retrotransposon-Mediated Aluminum Tolerance through Enhanced Expression of the Citrate Transporter OsFRDL4
<p>High <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> (Al) tolerance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is controlled by multiple tolerance genes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these genes are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the factors regulating the expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i>, a gene encoding a citrate efflux transporter involved in Al-induced citrate secretion from the roots. Analysis with chromosome segment substitution lines derived from cv Nipponbare (high <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) and cv Kasalath (low <i>OsFRDL4</i> expression) revealed that the differential expression of <i>OsFRDL4</i> is responsible for the quantitative trait locus for Al tolerance detected previously on chromosome 1. Comparison of the <i>OsFRDL4</i> gene structure in cv Nipponbare and cv Kasalath showed that there was no difference in the position of the transcriptional start site, but a 1.2-kb insertion showing high similarity to the solo long terminal repeat of the retrotransposon was found in the promoter region of <i>OsFRDL4</i> in cv Nipponbare. This insertion showed higher promoter activity and contained nine cis-acting elements for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (ART1). However, this insertion did not alter the spatial expression or cellular localization of OsFRDL4. Furthermore, this insertion was found in most <i>japonica</i> varieties but was largely absent from <i>indica</i> varieties or wild rice species. These results indicate that the 1.2-kb insertion in the <i>OsFRDL4</i> promoter region in <i>japonica</i> subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of <i>OsFRDL4</i> due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1. Our results also suggest that this insertion event happened at the initial stage of domestication of <i>japonica</i> subspecies.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization surface, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al apposition rate and bone formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

We report reflectance spectra of Ryugu’s surface acquired with the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) on Hayabusa2, to provide direct measurements of the surface composition and geological context for the returned samples. A weak, narrow absorption feature centered at 2.72 micrometers was detected across the entire observed surface, indicating that hydroxyl (OH)–bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als are ubiquitous there. The intensity of the OH feature and low albedo are similar to thermally and/or shock-metamorphosed carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field
<p>A study published this week offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can sense Earth's magnetic field. But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious magnetic sense, do we ever use it? And does it arise from an iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al found in our brains, as the authors believe? The experiment recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled magnetic field equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in brain waves of a certain frequency. But some researchers aren't convinced that the brain's reaction to a magnetic field represents a true "sense" unless this reaction also guides our behavior.</p>

Scalable and safe synthetic organic electroreduction inspired by Li-ion battery chemistry
<p>Reductive electrosynthesis has faced long-standing challenges in applications to complex organic substrates at scale. Here, we show how decades of research in lithium-ion battery materials, electrolytes, and additives can serve as an inspiration for achieving practically scalable reductive electrosynthetic conditions for the Birch reduction. Specifically, we demonstrate that using a sacrificial anode material (magnesium or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong>), combined with a cheap, nontoxic, and water-soluble proton source (dimethylurea), and an overcharge protectant inspired by battery technology [tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoramide] can allow for multigram-scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal reductions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metal–type reductive transformations, including McMurry couplings, reductive ketone deoxygenations, and epoxide openings.</p>

Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces
<p>The rational synthesis of nanographenes and carbon nanoribbons directly on nonmetallic surfaces has been an elusive goal for a long time. We report that activation of the carbon (C)–fluorine (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling directly on metal oxide surfaces. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes directly on the rutile titania surface. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting surfaces.</p>

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space.

High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

Here, we report that merging hydrogen bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activation for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on hydrogen bonding complexation to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformation. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea catalyst to form a tridentate hydrogen bonding complex with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e from its cesium salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium ion. This fluorination method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.</p>

Two-billion-year-old evaporites capture Earth’s great oxidation
<p>Major changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry occurred in the Paleoproterozoic era (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago). Increasing oxidation dramatically changed Earth’s surface, but few quantitative constraints exist on this important transition. This study describes the sedimentology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alogy, and geochemistry of a 2-billion-year-old, ~800-meter-thick evaporite succession from the Onega Basin in Russian Karelia. The deposit consists of a basal unit dominated by halite (~100 meters) followed by units dominated by anhydrite-magnesite (~500 meters) and dolomite-magnesite (~200 meters). The evaporite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als robustly constrain marine sulfate concentrations to at least 10 millimoles per kilogram of water, representing an oxidant reservoir equivalent to more than 20% of the modern ocean-atmosphere oxidizing capacity. These results show that substantial amounts of surface oxidant accumulated during this critical transition in Earth’s oxygenation.</p>

Unexpected reversal of C<sub>3</sub> versus C<sub>4</sub> grass response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during a 20-year field experiment
<p>Theory predicts and evidence shows that plant species that use the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway (C<sub>4</sub> species) are less responsive to elevated carbon dioxide (<i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) than species that use only the C<sub>3</sub> pathway (C<sub>3</sub> species). We document a reversal from this expected C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> contrast. Over the first 12 years of a 20-year free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment with 88 C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> grassland plots, we found that biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>3</sub> but not C<sub>4</sub> plots, as expected. During the subsequent 8 years, the pattern reversed: Biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>4</sub> but not C<sub>3</sub> plots. Soil net nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization rates, an index of soil nitrogen supply, exhibited a similar shift: <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> first enhanced but later depressed rates in C<sub>3</sub> plots, with the opposite true in C<sub>4</sub> plots, partially explaining the reversal of the <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> biomass response. These findings challenge the current C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> paradigm and show that even the best-supported short-term drivers of plant response to global change might not predict long-term results.</p>

Ice-VII inclusions in diamonds: Evidence for aqueous fluid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>Water-rich regions in Earth’s deeper mantle are suspected to play a key role in the global water budget and the mobility of heat-generating elements. We show that ice-VII occurs as inclusions in natural diamond and serves as an indicator for such water-rich regions. Ice-VII, the residue of aqueous fluid present during growth of diamond, crystallizes upon ascent of the host diamonds but remains at pressures as high as 24 gigapascals; it is now recognized as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al by the International <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alogical Association.

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper ions exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with reaction at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations to demonstrate that under reaction conditions, mobilized Cu ions can travel through zeolite windows and form transient ion pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> centers limits the volume that each ion can explore and thus its capacity to form an ion pair. The dynamic, reversible formation of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the conventional boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Plants transfer lipids to sustain colonization by mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic fungi
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi facilitate plant uptake of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al nutrients and draw organic nutrients from the plant. Organic nutrients are thought to be supplied primarily in the form of sugars. Here we show that the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> is a fatty acid auxotroph and that fatty acids synthesized in the host plants are transferred to the fungus to sustain mycorrhizal colonization. The transfer is dependent on RAM2 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 2) and the ATP binding cassette transporter–mediated plant lipid export pathway. We further show that plant fatty acids can be transferred to the pathogenic fungus <i>Golovinomyces cichoracerum</i> and are required for colonization by pathogens. We suggest that the mutualistic mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi similarly recruit the fatty acid biosynthesis program to facilitate host invasion.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming
<p>Soil organic carbon harbors three times as much carbon as Earth’s atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al soil, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all soil depths increased with 4°C warming; annual soil respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface soil) and models.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, phenyl cation intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylation reactions. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl cation equivalents have received limited attention in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered applications in selective intermolecular processes. We report a reaction design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cation equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluorid</span></strong>e activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This reaction manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylation of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as methane. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild conditions (30° to 100°C).</p>

Controlled growth and form of precipitating microsculptures

Motivated by a variety of bioinspired coprecipitation patterns of carbonate and silica, we develop a geometrical theory for the kinetics of the growth front that leaves behind thin-walled complex structures. Our theory explains the range of previously observed experimental patterns and, in addition, predicts unexplored assembly pathways. This allows us to design a number of functional base shapes of optical microstructures, which we synthesize to demonstrate their light-guiding capabilities. Overall, our framework provides a way to understand and control the growth and form of functional precipitating microsculptures.</p>

Active sites for CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation to methanol on Cu/ZnO catalysts

We report a direct comparison between the activity of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu model catalysts for methanol synthesis. By combining x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we can identify and characterize the reactivity of each catalyst. Both experimental and theoretical results agree that ZnCu undergoes surface oxidation under the reaction conditions so that surface Zn transforms into ZnO and allows ZnCu to reach the activity of ZnO/Cu with the same Zn coverage. Our results highlight a synergy of Cu and ZnO at the interface that facilitates methanol synthesis via formate intermediates.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the melting point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form basaltic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally.

Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling geophysical observations of the melting regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level.

Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al ion homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffusion of ions between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in ion homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulation is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil conditions.</p>

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial plants form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the plant and enhance the plant’s uptake of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host plants; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that tomato plants have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved plant K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

Characterization of CRISPR Mutants Targeting Genes Modulating Pectin Degradation in Ripening Tomato
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a globally important crop with an economic value in the tens of billions of dollars, and a significant supplier of essential vitamins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, and phytochemicals in the human diet. Shelf life is a key quality trait related to alterations in cuticle properties and remodeling of the fruit cell walls. Studies with transgenic tomato plants undertaken over the last 20 years have indicated that a range of pectin-degrading enzymes are involved in cell wall remodeling. These studies usually involved silencing of only a single gene and it has proved difficult to compare the effects of silencing these genes across the different experimental systems. Here we report the generation of CRISPR-based mutants in the ripening-related genes encoding the pectin-degrading enzymes pectate lyase (PL), polygalacturonase 2a (PG2a), and β-galactanase (TBG4). Comparison of the physiochemical properties of the fruits from a range of <i>PL</i>, <i>PG2a</i>, and <i>TBG4</i> CRISPR lines demonstrated that only mutations in <i>PL</i> resulted in firmer fruits, although mutations in <i>PG2a</i> and <i>TBG4</i> influenced fruit color and weight. Pectin localization, distribution, and solubility in the pericarp cells of the CRISPR mutant fruits were investigated using the monoclonal antibody probes LM19 to deesterified homogalacturonan, INRA-RU1 to rhamnogalacturonan I, LM5 to β-1,4-galactan, and LM6 to arabinan epitopes, respectively. The data indicate that PL, PG2a, and TBG4 act on separate cell wall domains and the importance of cellulose microfibril-associated pectin is reflected in its increased occurrence in the different mutant lines.</p>

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid soil. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid soils. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid soils, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid soils.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in root architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency root phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense root hairs and attenuated primary root growth. Quantitative protein profiling of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type roots using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein profiles. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-root-hair phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive root hair-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the root, which may be causative for the alterations in root hair morphogenesis. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), harboring a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox homeostasis.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression systems can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current systems have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based system with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based system allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

Physiological Responses and Gene Co-Expression Network of Mycorrhizal Roots under K<sup>+</sup> Deprivation
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations enhance the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host plants, but little is known about their role in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. <i>Medicago truncatula</i> plants were cocultured with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> under high and low K<sup>+</sup> regimes for 6 weeks. We determined how K<sup>+</sup> deprivation affects plant development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al acquisition and how these negative effects are tempered by the AM colonization. The transcriptional response of AM roots under K<sup>+</sup> deficiency was analyzed by whole-genome RNA sequencing. K<sup>+</sup> deprivation decreased root biomass and external K<sup>+</sup> uptake and modulated oxidative stress gene expression in <i>M. truncatula</i> roots. AM colonization induced specific transcriptional responses to K<sup>+</sup> deprivation that seem to temper these negative effects. A gene network analysis revealed putative key regulators of these responses. This study confirmed that AM associations provide some tolerance to K<sup>+</sup> deprivation to host plants, revealed that AM symbiosis modulates the expression of specific root genes to cope with this nutrient stress, and identified putative regulators participating in these tolerance mechanisms.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aluminum</span></strong> (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

Thioredoxin-Mediated ROS Homeostasis Explains Natural Variation in Plant Regeneration
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation is fundamental to basic research and agricultural applications. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation capacity of plants varies largely in different genotypes, but the reason for this variation remains elusive. Here, we identified a novel thioredoxin DCC1 in determining the capacity of shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation among Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural variation. Loss of function of <i>DCC1</i> resulted in inhibited shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation. <i>DCC1</i> was expressed mainly in the inner tissues of the callus and encoded a functional thioredoxin that was localized in the mitochondria. DCC1 protein interacted directly with CARBONIC ANHYDRASE2 (CA2), which is an essential subunit of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I). DCC1 regulated Complex I activity via redox modification of CA2 protein. Mutation of <i>DCC1</i> or <i>CA2</i> led to reduced Complex I activity and triggered mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increased ROS level regulated shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation by repressing expression of the genes involved in multiple pathways. Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that DCC1 was a major determinant of the natural variation in shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation among Arabidopsis ecotypes. Thus, our study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism by which thioredoxin-dependent redox modification regulates de novo shoot initiation via the modulation of ROS homeostasis and provides new insights into improving the capacity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation.</p>

Acoel genome reveals the regulatory landscape of whole-body regeneration
<p>Whole-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation is accompanied by complex transcriptomic changes, yet the chromatin regulatory landscapes that mediate this dynamic response remain unexplored. To decipher the regulatory logic that orchestrates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, we sequenced the genome of the acoel worm <i>Hofstenia miamia</i>, a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative member of the sister lineage of other bilaterians. Epigenomic profiling revealed thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation-responsive chromatin regions and identified dynamically bound transcription factor motifs, with the early growth response (EGR) binding site as the most variably accessible during <i>Hofstenia</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation. Combining <i>egr</i> inhibition with chromatin profiling suggests that Egr functions as a pioneer factor to directly regulate early wound-induced genes. The genetic connections inferred by this approach allowed the construction of a gene regulatory network for whole-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, enabling genomics-based comparisons of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation across species.</p>

Self-organization and progenitor targeting generate stable patterns in planarian regeneration
<p>During animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, cells must organize into discrete and functional systems. We show that self-organization, along with patterning cues, govern progenitor behavior in planarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation. Surgical paradigms allowed the manipulation of planarian eye <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation in predictable locations and numbers, generating alternative stable neuroanatomical states for wild-type animals with multiple functional ectopic eyes. We used animals with multiple ectopic eyes and eye transplantation to demonstrate that broad progenitor specification, combined with self-organization, allows anatomy maintenance during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation. We propose a model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative progenitors involving (i) migratory targeting cues, (ii) self-organization into existing or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ating eyes, and (iii) a broad zone, associated with coarse progenitor specification, in which eyes can be targeted by progenitors.

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong>s appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Identification of a regeneration-organizing cell in the <i>Xenopus</i> tail
<p>Unlike mammals, <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpoles have a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative potential. To characterize this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative response, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing after tail amputation. By comparing naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation-competent and -incompetent tadpoles, we identified a previously unrecognized cell type, which we term the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation-organizing cell (ROC). ROCs are present in the epidermis during normal tail development and specifically relocalize to the amputation plane of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation-competent tadpoles, forming the wound epidermis. Genetic ablation or manual removal of ROCs blocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, whereas transplantation of ROC-containing grafts induces ectopic outgrowths in early embryos. Transcriptional profiling revealed that ROCs secrete ligands associated with key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative pathways, signaling to progenitors to reconstitute lost tissue. These findings reveal the cellular mechanism through which ROCs form the wound epidermis and ensure successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation.</p>

Injury-induced <i>ctgfa</i> directs glial bridging and spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish

Regeneration of <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> Plants from Protoplasts Induces Widespread Genome Instability
<p>Nontransgenic genome editing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>able protoplasts, plant cells free of their cell wall, could revolutionize crop improvement because it reduces regulatory and technical complexity. However, plant tissue culture is known to engender frequent unwanted variation, termed somaclonal variation. To evaluate the contribution of large-scale genome instability to this phenomenon, we analyzed potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ated from either protoplasts or stem explants for copy number changes by comparison of Illumina read depth. Whereas a control set of eight plants that had been propagated by cuttings displayed no changes, all 15 protoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ants tested were affected by aneuploidy or structural chromosomal changes. Certain chromosomes displayed segmental deletions and duplications ranging from one to many. Resampling different leaves of the same plant found differences in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ants, indicating frequent persistence of instability. By comparison, 33 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ants from stem explants used for <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation displayed less frequent but still considerable (18%) large-scale copy number changes. Repetition of certain instability patterns suggested greater susceptibility in specific genomic sites. These results indicate that tissue culture, depending on the protocol used, can induce genomic instability resulting in large-scale changes likely to compromise final plant phenotype.</p>

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration

Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative (neonatal) versus non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery.

Building bridges to regenerate axons
<p>After traumatic spinal cord injury, local damage responses have an important effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ating axons. In lower organisms (i.e., zebrafish and newt), glial cells and other non-neuronal cell types proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to form a bridge between the two ends of a transected spinal cord. This glial bridge supports axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation across the lesion site, enabling functional recovery. However, in mammals, a glial scar composed of mixed cell types and extracellular matrix forms to seal such a wound. Although early studies emphasized the inhibitory nature of this scar, recent studies have revealed that in mammals, as in lower organisms, it can also serve as a bridge to facilitate axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). Yet, how this glial reaction is regulated remains largely unknown. On page 630 of this issue, Mokalled <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) report that connective tissue growth factor a (CTGFa) is crucial for directing glial bridging and subsequent axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation in a zebrafish model of spinal cord injury. Although it remains to be determined whether this is the case in mammals, this finding could inform the design of neural repair strategies.</p>

The nociceptin receptor inhibits axonal regeneration and recovery from spinal cord injury
<p>Axonal growth after traumatic spinal cord injury is limited by endogenous inhibitors, selective blockade of which promotes partial neurological recovery. The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in <i>Ngr1</i>, which encodes a receptor for myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation such as Nogo, revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of <i>ORL1</i>, which encodes the receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin. Endogenous and overexpressed ORL1 coimmunoprecipitated with immature NgR1 protein, and ORL1 enhanced the O-linked glycosylation and surface expression of NgR1 in HEK293T and Neuro2A cells and primary neurons. ORL1 overexpression inhibited cortical neuron axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation independently of NgR1. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation was inhibited by an ORL1 agonist and enhanced by the ORL1 antagonist J113397 through a ROCK-dependent mechanism. Mice treated with J113397 after dorsal hemisection of the mid-thoracic spinal cord recovered greater locomotor function and exhibited lumbar raphespinal axon sprouting. These effects were further enhanced by combined <i>Ngr1</i> deletion and ORL1 inhibition. Thus, ORL1 limits neural repair directly and indirectly by enhancing NgR1 maturation, and ORL1 antagonists enhance recovery from traumatic CNS injuries in wild-type and <i>Ngr1</i> null mice.</p>

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation

Precise control of miR-125b levels is required to create a regeneration-permissive environment after spinal cord injury: a cross-species comparison between salamander and rat
<p>Most spinal cord injuries lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative abilities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We focused on upstream regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican axolotl salamander (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels of one of these miRNAs (miR-125b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target <i>Sema4D</i> in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR-125b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated <i>Sema4D</i> and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of <i>miR-125b</i> and <i>Sema4D</i> must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian spinal cord injuries.</p>

Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ate bone after fin amputation. In this process, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, differentiated osteoblasts do not appear to contribute to repair of bone injuries in mammals; rather, osteoblasts form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether osteoblast dedifferentiation is specific to appendage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish bone. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature osteoblasts is not restricted to fin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and skull injuries. In both models, mature osteoblasts surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-osteoblast state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that osteoblasts migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for osteoblast dedifferentiation in reparative bone formation in fish and indicate that adult fish osteoblasts display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian bone-forming cells.</p>

The transcription factor Lef1 switches partners from β-catenin to Smad3 during muscle stem cell quiescence
<p>Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, persist in adult mammals by entering a state of quiescence (G<sub>0</sub>) during the early postnatal period. Quiescence is reversed during damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation and re-established after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation. Entry of cultured myoblasts into G<sub>0</sub> is associated with a specific, reversible induction of Wnt target genes, thus implicating members of the Tcf and Lef1 (Tcf/Lef) transcription factor family, which mediate transcriptional responses to Wnt signaling, in the initiation of quiescence. We found that the canonical Wnt effector β-catenin, which cooperates with Tcf/Lef, was dispensable for myoblasts to enter quiescence. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches in cultured C2C12 myoblasts and in MuSCs, we demonstrated that Tcf/Lef activity during quiescence depended not on β-catenin but on the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) effector and transcriptional coactivator Smad3, which colocalized with Lef1 at canonical Wnt-responsive elements and directly interacted with Lef1 specifically in G<sub>0</sub>. Depletion of Smad3, but not β-catenin, reduced Lef1 occupancy at target promoters, Tcf/Lef target gene expression, and self-renewal of myoblasts. In vivo, MuSCs underwent a switch from β-catenin–Lef1 to Smad3-Lef1 interactions during the postnatal switch from proliferation to quiescence, with β-catenin–Lef1 interactions recurring during damage-induced reactivation. Our findings suggest that the interplay of Wnt-Tcf/Lef and TGF-β–Smad3 signaling activates canonical Wnt target promoters in a manner that depends on β-catenin during myoblast proliferation but is independent of β-catenin during MuSC quiescence.</p>

This is equivalent to an average uptake rate of 2.6 ± 0.3 Pg C year<sup>−1</sup> and represents 31 ± 4% of the global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over this period. Although this global ocean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> estimate is consistent with the expectation of the ocean uptake having increased in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, substantial regional differences in storage rate are found, likely owing to climate variability–driven changes in ocean circulation.</p>

The yeast harvests photogenerated electrons from the illuminated nanoparticles and uses them for the cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation of redox cofactors. This process enables the decoupling of biosynthesis and cofactor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, facilitating a carbon- and energy-efficient production of the metabolite shikimic acid, a common precursor for several drugs and fine chemicals. Our work provides a platform for the rational design of biohybrids for efficient biomanufacturing processes with higher complexity and functionality.</p>

Diatom ooze—A large marine mercury sink
<p>The role of algae for sequestration of atmospheric mercury in the ocean is largely unknown owing to a lack of marine sediment data. We used high-resolution cores from marine Antarctica to estimate Holocene global mercury accumulation in biogenic siliceous sediments (diatom ooze). Diatom ooze exhibits the highest mercury accumulation rates ever reported for the marine environment and provides a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> of anthropogenic mercury, surpassing existing model estimates by as much as a factor of 7. Anthropogenic pollution of the Southern Ocean began ~150 years ago, and up to 20% of anthropogenic mercury emitted to the atmosphere may have been stored in diatom ooze. These findings reveal the crucial role of diatoms as a fast vector for mercury sequestration and diatom ooze as a large marine mercury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong>.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new particles and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> of new particles. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the particle growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong>, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary particle formation in China.</p>

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system
<p>Age-associated decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation capacity limits the restoration of nervous system functionality after injury. In a model for demyelination, we found that old mice fail to resolve the inflammatory response initiated after myelin damage. Aged phagocytes accumulated excessive amounts of myelin debris, which triggered cholesterol crystal formation and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and stimulated inflammasomes. Myelin debris clearance required cholesterol transporters, including apolipoprotein E. Stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity of old mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. Thus, cholesterol-rich myelin debris can overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of cholesterol into crystals and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that impedes tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation.</p>

Regeneration of fat cells from myofibroblasts during wound healing
<p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation through the reprogramming of one cell lineage to another occurs in fish and amphibians, it has not been observed in mammals. We discovered in the mouse that during wound healing, adipocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ate from myofibroblasts, a cell type thought to be differentiated and nonadipogenic. Myofibroblast reprogramming required neogenic hair follicles, which triggered bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and then activation of adipocyte transcription factors expressed during development. Overexpression of the BMP antagonist Noggin in hair follicles or deletion of the BMP receptor in myofibroblasts prevented adipocyte formation. Adipocytes formed from human keloid fibroblasts either when treated with BMP or when placed with human hair follicles in vitro<i>.</i> Thus, we identify the myofibroblast as a plastic cell type that may be manipulated to treat scars in humans.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong>s is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong>s. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide transporters of the SUGAR TRANSPORT PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally transports xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not transport hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to transport <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose transporters for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation through formation of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root formation using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT FORMATION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus formation. Endogenous callus formation precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation model through de novo root formation, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>able Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid transformation provides a rational template to implement plastid transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Transcription Factors WOX11/12 Directly Activate <i>WOX5/7</i> to Promote Root Primordia Initiation and Organogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>De novo organogenesis, which gives rise to adventitious roots and shoots, is a type of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation for survival after wounding. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), two main cell fate transition steps are required to establish the root primordium during de novo root organogenesis from leaf explants. The first step from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation-competent cells to root founder cells involves activation of <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11</i> (<i>WOX11</i>) and <i>WOX12</i> (<i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i>) expression by auxin. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the second step of fate transition from root founder cells to root primordium is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the expression levels of <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> decrease while those of <i>WOX5</i> and <i>7</i> (<i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>) increase during the transition from root founder cells to the root primordium. <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> function genetically upstream of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>, and the WOX11/12 proteins directly bind to the promoters of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> to activate their transcription. Mutations in <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> result in defective primordium formation. Overall, our data indicate that the expression switch from <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> to <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> is critical for initiation of the root primordium during de novo root organogenesis.</p>

Gene Regulation by the AGL15 Transcription Factor Reveals Hormone Interactions in Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>The MADS box transcription factor Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE15</i> (<i>AGL15</i>) and a putative ortholog from soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), <i>GmAGL15</i>, are able to promote somatic embryogenesis (SE) in these plants when ectopically expressed. SE is an important means of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, but many plants, or even particular cultivars, are recalcitrant for this process. Understanding how (Gm)AGL15 promotes SE by identifying and characterizing direct and indirect downstream regulated genes can provide means to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation by SE for crop improvement and to perform molecular tests of genes. Conserved transcription factors and the genes they regulate in common between species may provide the most promising avenue to identify targets for SE improvement. We show that (Gm)AGL15 negatively regulates auxin signaling in both Arabidopsis and soybean at many levels of the pathway, including the repression of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR6</i> (<i>ARF6</i>) and <i>ARF8</i> and <i>TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1</i> as well as the indirect control of components via direct expression of a microRNA-encoding gene. We demonstrate interaction between auxin and gibberellic acid in the promotion of SE and document an inverse correlation between bioactive gibberellic acid and SE in soybean, a difficult crop to transform. Finally, we relate hormone accumulation to transcript accumulation of important soybean embryo regulatory factors such as ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3 and provide a working model of hormone and transcription factor interaction in the control of SE.</p>

Ethylene-Regulated Glutamate Dehydrogenase Fine-Tunes Metabolism during Anoxia-Reoxygenation
<p>Ethylene is an essential hormone in plants that is involved in low-oxygen and reoxygenation responses. As a key transcription factor in ethylene signaling, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) activates targets that trigger various responses. However, most of these targets are still poorly characterized. Through analyses of our microarray data and the published Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EIN3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set, we inferred the putative targets of EIN3 during anoxia-reoxygenation. Among them, <i>GDH2</i>, which encodes one subunit of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), was chosen for further studies for its role in tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment. We demonstrated that both <i>GDH1</i> and <i>GDH2</i> are induced during anoxia and reoxygenation and that this induction is mediated via ethylene signaling. In addition, the results of enzymatic assays showed that the level of GDH during anoxia-reoxygenation decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutants <i>ein2-5</i> and <i>ein3eil1</i>. Global metabolite analysis indicated that the deamination activity of GDH might <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ate 2-oxoglutarate, which is a cosubstrate that facilitates the breakdown of alanine by alanine aminotransferase when reoxygenation occurs. Moreover, ineffective tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment, disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, reduced phytosterol biosynthesis, and delayed energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation were found in <i>gdh1gdh2</i> and ethylene mutants during reoxygenation. Taken together, these data illustrate the essential role of EIN3-regulated GDH activity in metabolic adjustment during anoxia-reoxygenation.</p>

In this study, treatment with a collagen-based matrix stimulated molecular myogenesis in an <i>mdx</i> murine model of necrosis. Matrix-treated animals ran ≥40% further, demonstrating functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation, and expressed increased levels of myogenic transcripts. By contrast, matrix treatment was unable to induce transcriptional or functional changes in an <i>MLC/SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></i> atrophic mouse model. <i>In vitro</i>, satellite cells were cultured under standard conditions, on matrix, in the presence of myocyte debris (to simulate a necrotic-like environment) or with both matrix and necrotic stimuli. Exposure to both matrix and necrotic stimuli induced the greatest increases in <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i>, <i>myoD</i> and myogenin transcripts. Furthermore, conditioned medium collected from satellite cells cultured with both stimuli contained elevated levels of factors that modulate satellite cell activation and proliferation, such as FGF-2, HGF and SDF-1. Application of the conditioned medium to C2C12 myoblasts accelerated maturation, as demonstrated by increased <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i> and myogenin transcripts and fusion indexes. In summary, the collagen matrix required a necrotic stimulus to enhance the maturation of satellite cells and their secretion of a myogenic cocktail. Considering that matrix treatment supports myogenesis only in <i>in vivo</i> models that exhibit necrosis, this study demonstrates that a necrotic environment is required to maximize matrix-mediated myogenesis.</p>

We identify individual animals treated with RNA-guided nucleases that have mutation frequencies close to 100% at targeted sites. We employ this technique to completely functionally ablate EGFP expression in transgenic animals and recapitulate developmental phenotypes produced by loss of the conserved gene <i>brachyury</i>. Thus, this advance allows a reverse genetic approach in the axolotl and will undoubtedly provide invaluable insight into the mechanisms of salamanders' unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ative ability.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regener</span></strong>ation. In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to source leaves and sinks is essential for suppor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> env<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>ments. We analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> storage pools, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in both high and deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> env<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>ments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> partit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing processes is critical for high oilseed product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of polyhydrides with unusually high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ratios. These polyhydrides have complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ic sublattices. We synthesized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> pentahydride (FeH<sub>5</sub>) by a direct react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> and H<sub>2</sub> above 130 gigapascals in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. FeH<sub>5</sub> exhibits a structure built of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> only. It consists of intercalated layers of quasicubic FeH<sub>3</sub> units and four-plane slabs of thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>.

Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb).

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s mimics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indica<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the level at which heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s. Enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zinc</span></strong> (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indica<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cobalt</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nickel</span></strong> altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manganes</span></strong>e evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indica<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manganes</span></strong>e antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic act<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of individual heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s.</p>

Iron-Nicotianamine Transporters Are Required for Proper Long Distance Iron Signaling
<p>The mechanisms of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> uptake and the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al networks that control root-level regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> uptake have been well studied, but the mechanisms by which shoots signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> status to the roots remain opaque. Here, we characterize an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) double mutant, <i>yellow stripe1-like yellow stripe3-like</i> (<i>ysl1ysl3</i>), which has lost the ability to properly regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> deficiency-influenced gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in both roots and shoots. In spite of markedly low tissue levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>, the double mutant does not up- and down-regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> deficiency-induced and -repressed genes. We have used graf<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g experiments to show that wild-type roots grafted to <i>ysl1ysl3</i> shoots do not initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> deficiency-induced gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, indica<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g that the <i>ysl1ysl3</i> shoots fail to send an appropriate long-distance signal of shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> status to the roots. We present a model to explain how impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in leaf veins results in incorrect signals of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> sufficiency being sent to roots and affec<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> there.

Convergent evidence for widespread rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> availability is a pivotal control on terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sequestrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and global climate change.

Evidence drawn from the planet’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> balance, geo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually.

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> control and phase-aligned state manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture.

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–mel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. All solid catalysts previously used for this react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> have been deactivated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> deposit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products.

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, as visualized using the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-specific probe singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor green. The product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. In parallel, gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> changes specific to the presence of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> were observed. The accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of other reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species, namely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, both the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> scavenger His and the lip<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Serpin-protease interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indica<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth of dicotyledonous species improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> acquisit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al-structural modeling in SimRoot indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced root secondary growth reduces root metabolic costs, increases root length, improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> soil. Observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> stress, resource allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is shifted from secondary to primary root growth, genetic variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exists for this response, and reduced secondary growth improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> capture from low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> soil. Under low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary growth had 39% smaller root cross-sect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al area, 60% less root respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, 27% greater root length, 78% greater shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. In the field under low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong>, these genotypes had 43% smaller root cross-sect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al area, 32% greater root length, 58% greater shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. Secondary growth eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth is an adaptive response to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorus</span></strong> availability and merits investigat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as a potential breeding target.</p>

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in many essential metabolic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. In mammals, the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulator is linked mainly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent hydroxylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiqui<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g bioengineered vers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of this mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent fash<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in plants.

Wheat Vacuolar Iron Transporter TaVIT2 Transports Fe and Mn and Is Effective for Biofortification
<p>Increasing the intrinsic nutrit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al quality of crops, known as biofortificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> content of staple crops such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of wheat, we funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally characterized homologs of the <i>VACUOLAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> TRANSPORTER</i> (<i>VIT</i>). The wheat genome contains two <i>VIT</i> paralogs, <i>TaVIT1</i> and <i>TaVIT2</i>, which have different express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) mutant defective in vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> transport. TaVIT2 also complemented a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manganes</span></strong>e transporter mutant but not a vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zinc</span></strong> transporter mutant. By overexpressing <i>TaVIT2</i> under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> in white flour fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, exceeding minimum legal fortificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>utrient phytate was not increased and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> in the white flour fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was bioavailable in vitro, sugges<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g that food products made from the biofortified flour could contribute to improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> nutrit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> transport in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing exis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

Atomically dispersed Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites catalyze efficient CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction to CO
<p>Currently, the most active electrocatalysts for the convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gold</span></strong>-based nanomaterials, whereas non–precious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> catalysts have shown low to modest activity. Here, we report a catalyst of dispersed single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> sites that produces CO at an overpotential as low as 80 millivolts. Partial current density reaches 94 milliamperes per square centimeter at an overpotential of 340 millivolts. Operando x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe<sup>3+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, coordinated to pyrrolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> (N) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s of the N-doped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> support, that maintain their +3 oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> state during electrocatalysis, probably through electronic coupling to the conductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> support. Electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al data suggest that the Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites derive their superior activity from faster CO<sub>2</sub> adsorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and weaker CO absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> than that of convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al Fe<sup>2+</sup> sites.</p>

Observation of alkaline earth complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) that mimic transition metals
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkaline earth met</span></strong>als <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> (Ca), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strontium</span></strong> (Sr), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barium</span></strong> (Ba) typically engage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al bonding as classical main-group <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s through their <i>n</i>s and <i>n</i>p valence orbitals, where <i>n</i> is the principal quantum number.

Analysis of the electronic structure of these cubic <i>O<sub>h</sub></i>-symmetric complexes reveals that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide (CO) bonds arise mainly from [M(d<sub>π</sub>)] → (CO)<sub>8</sub> π backdonat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which explains the strong observed red shift of the C-O stretching frequencies. The corresponding radical cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> complexes were also prepared in gas phase and characterized by mass-selected infrared photodissociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, confirming adherence to the 18-electron rule more convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally associated with transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> chemistry.</p>

Cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of enamides enabled by single-electron reduction

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The water-gas shift (WGS) react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide plus water yields di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide) is an essential process for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide removal in various energy-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. This equilibrium-limited react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is favored at a low working temperature. Potential applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the working temperature of on-site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> units. We synthesized layered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gold</span></strong> (Au) clusters on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molybdenum</span></strong> carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>-transpor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g protein funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that diminishes transmembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> flux in dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>ct sites and direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Because other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>-transport proteins remain active, labile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in DMT1-deficient rats and ferropor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small molecule–mediated site- and direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-selective restorat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> transport. They also suggest that small molecules that partially mimic the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of missing protein transporters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>, and possibly other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, may have potential in trea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g human diseases.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>ctive quantum effects expected to arise in them.

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is achieved through synchronous contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> release from intracellular stores and subsequent activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> channel with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as a transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction of a single molecule
<p>Plasmon-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of molecules adsorbed on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> nanostructures are attrac<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g increased attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for photocatalytic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.

The biosynthesis of methanobactin
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> homeostasis poses a major challenge to microbes, which must acquire scarce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s for core metabolic processes. Methanobac<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>, an extensively modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">copper</span></strong>-chela<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g peptide, was one of the earliest natural products shown to enable microbial acquisit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> other than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>.

Synthesis of ultrasmall, homogeneously alloyed, bimetallic nanoparticles on silica supports
<p>Supported nanoparticles containing more than one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> have a variety of applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. Common synthesis techniques for this type of material often result in large, unalloyed nanoparticles that lack the interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that give the particles their desired characteristics. We demonstrate a relatively simple, effective, generalizable method to produce highly dispersed, well-alloyed bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic nanoparticles.

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of methane, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis.

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy

Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn miss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we determined the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>, and potassium on Ceres.

The non-icy port<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Ceres’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> to those present in aqueously altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>aceous chondrites; however, the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> on Ceres is lower than in the aforement<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed chondrites.

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p>Soil is the largest terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sink by 2100, yet the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sequestrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> stabilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simula<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g future atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide dynamics.</p>

Calcium Pumps and Interacting BON1 Protein Modulate Calcium Signature, Stomatal Closure, and Plant Immunity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signaling is essential for env<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>mental responses including immune responses. Here, we provide evidence that the evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>arily conserved protein BONZAI1 (BON1) funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s together with autoinhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ATPase10 (ACA10) and ACA8 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signals in Arabidopsis. BON1 is a plasma membrane localized protein that negatively regulates the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of immune receptor genes and positively regulates stomatal closure. We found that BON1 interacts with the autoinhibitory domains of ACA10 and ACA8, and the <i>aca10</i> loss-of-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (LOF) mutants have an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of the <i>bon1</i> LOF mutants. Genetic evidences indicate that BON1 positively regulates the activities of ACA10 and ACA8. Consistent with this idea, the steady level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is increased in both <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Most strikingly, cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> oscillat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> imposed by external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> treatment was altered in <i>aca10</i>, <i>aca8</i>, and <i>bon1</i> mutants in guard cells. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>- and pathogen-induced stomatal closure was compromised in the <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Taken together, this study indicates that ACA10/8 and BON1 physically interact on plasma membrane and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of cytosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signatures that are critical for stomatal movement and impact plant immunity.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in seeds is a prerequisite for germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> transport processes and their interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in seeds, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manganes</span></strong>e (Mn) subclade of cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In mutant embryos lacking express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>VACUOLAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong> (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, sugges<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g that MTP8 transports Fe in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjec<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, MTP8 promoted reallocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stores as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> homeostasis and germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency under challenging env<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iron</span></strong>mental condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-limi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, a fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ality of the filament, as an associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>, and fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. The predicted growth rate under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-replete and -deplete condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, as well as the effect of external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After considerat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>uous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding with minimal sample consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Results indicate a downregulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, sugges<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g increased phosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Results suggest a set of controls regula<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tin</span></strong>g mitochondrial funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

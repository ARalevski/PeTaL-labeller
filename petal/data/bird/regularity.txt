Gene Tree Discordance Can Generate Patterns of Diminishing Convergence over Time
<p>Phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence is an exciting outcome of adaptive evolution, occurring when different species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the molecular basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which molecular evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> of diminishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence over time, ascribing this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an alternative cause of changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence levels over time in a primate dataset. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of diminishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence makes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence in primates. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, discordance due to errors in species tree inference can drive similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s. Though intramolecular epistasis could in principle create a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence over time, our results suggest a possible alternative explanation for this widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene tree discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of molecular evolution.</p>

Development
Anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning are coordinated by an identical patterning clock
<p>Establishment of the body plan in vertebrates depends on the temporally coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing of tissues along the body axes. We have previously shown that dorsoventral (DV) tissues are temporally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed progressively from anterior to posterior by a BMP signaling pathway. Here we report that DV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing along the zebrafish anteroposterior (AP) axis is temporally coordinated with AP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing by an identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing clock. We altered AP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing by inhibiting or activating FGF, Wnt or retinoic acid signaling combined with inhibition of BMP signaling at a series of developmental time points, which revealed that the temporal progression of DV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing is directly coordinated with AP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing. We investigated how these signaling pathways are integrated and suggest a model for how DV and AP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing are temporally coordinated. It has been shown that in <i>Xenopus</i> dorsal tissues FGF and Wnt signaling quell BMP signaling by degrading phosphorylated (P) Smad1/5, the BMP pathway signal transducer, via phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region. We show that in zebrafish FGF/MAPK, but not Wnt/GSK3, phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region localizes to a ventral vegetal gastrula region that could coordinate DV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing with AP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing ventrally without degrading P-Smad1/5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the MAPK phosphorylation sites in the Smad5 linker causes precocious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing of DV tissues along the AP axis during gastrulation. Thus, DV and AP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing are intimately coordinated to allow cells to acquire both positional and temporal information simultaneously.</p>

Role of Glycosyltransferases in Pollen Wall Primexine Formation and Exine Patterning
<p>The pollen cell wall is important for protection of male sperm from physical stresses and consists of an inner gametophyte-derived intine layer and a sporophyte-derived exine layer. The polymeric constituents of the robust exine are termed sporopollenin. The mechanisms by which sporopollenin is anchored onto microspores and polymerized in specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s are unknown, but the primexine, a transient cell wall matrix formed on the surface of microspores at the late tetrad stage, is hypothesized to play a key role. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>spongy</i> (<i>spg</i>) and <i>uneven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> of exine</i> (<i>upex</i>) mutants exhibit defective and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irregular</span></strong> exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s. <i>SPG2</i> (synonymous with <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irregular</span></strong> XYLEM9-LIKE</i> [<i>IRX9L</i>]) encodes a family GT43 glycosyltransferase involved in xylan backbone biosynthesis, while <i>UPEX1</i> encodes a family GT31 glycosyltransferase likely involved in galactosylation of arabinogalactan proteins. Imaging of developing <i>irx9l</i> microspores showed that the earliest detectable defect was in primexine formation. Furthermore, wild-type microspores contained primexine-localized epitopes indicative of the presence of xylan, but these were absent in <i>irx9l</i>. These data, together with the <i>spg</i> phenotype of a mutant in <i>IRX14L</i>, which also plays a role in xylan backbone elongation, indicate the presence of xylan in pollen wall primexine, which plays a role in exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing on the microspore surface. We observed an aberrant primexine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irregular</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of incipient sporopollenin deposition in <i>upex1</i>, suggesting that primexine-localized arabinogalactan proteins could play roles in sporopollenin adhesion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing early in microspore wall development. Our data provide new insights into the biochemical and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of the primexine component of the microspore cell wall.</p>

Tree Physiology
Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from inclined trees, along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood and opposite wood, cell wall crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension wood in all the lines contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic lines when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

A Cycloheximide-Sensitive Step in Transverse Microtubule Array Patterning
<p>The growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of individual cells within a tissue determine plant morphology, and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubule arrays, determines cellular growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. We investigated the mechanisms governing the formation of transverse microtubule array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s in axially growing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epidermal hypocotyl cells. Using quantitative imaging approaches, we mapped the transition of the cortical microtubule arrays into a transverse coaligned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> after induction with auxin and gibberellic acid. Hormone induction led to an early loss of microtubule plus end density and a rotation toward oblique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s. Beginning 30 min after induction, transverse microtubules appeared at the cell’s midzone concurrently with the loss of longitudinal polymers, eventually progressing apically and basally to remodel the array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>. Based on the timing and known hormone-signaling pathways, we tested the hypothesis that the later events require de novo gene expression and, thus, constitute a level of genetic control over transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing. We found that the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in a selective and reversible loss of transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s that were replaced with radial-like pinwheel arrays exhibiting a split bipolar architecture centered at the cell’s midzone. Experiments using hormone induction and CHX revealed that pinwheel arrays occur when transverse microtubules increase at the midzone but longitudinal microtubules in the split bipolar architecture are not suppressed. We propose that a key regulatory mechanism for creating the transverse microtubule coalignment in axially growing hypocotyls involves the expression of a CHX-sensitive factor that acts to suppress the nucleation of the longitudinally oriented polymers.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> knees during   high-flexion activities.

Agouti-related peptide 2 facilitates convergent evolution of stripe patterns across cichlid fish radiations
<p>The color <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of African cichlid fishes provide notable examples of phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ence. Across the more than 1200 East African rift lake species, melanic horizontal stripes have evolved numerous times. We discovered that regulatory changes of the gene <i>agouti-related peptide 2</i> (<i>agrp2</i>) act as molecular switches controlling this evolutionarily labile phenotype. Reduced <i>agrp2</i> expression is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ently associated with the presence of stripe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s across species flocks. However, cis-regulatory mutations are not predictive of stripes across radiations, suggesting independent regulatory mechanisms. Genetic mapping confirms the link between the <i>agrp2</i> locus and stripe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s. The crucial role of <i>agrp2</i> is further supported by a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout that reconstitutes stripes in a nonstriped cichlid. Thus, we unveil how a single gene affects the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ent evolution of a complex color <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>.</p>

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer formulations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed materials can be metals, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth compositions. No organic impurities are present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed layers, which helps achieve good electronic and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. The conductivity, carrier mobility, dielectric, and luminescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of optically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed layers are on par with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of state-of-the-art solution-processed materials. The ability to directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule arrays form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy defects in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant defect in the timing of transitions between array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s but no substantive defect in the array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule array architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate array transitions.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic mutations in cancer genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, genetic errors in cancer cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from cancer genomes have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of genetic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

Evidence for a neural law of effect
<p>Thorndike’s law of effect states that actions that lead to reinforcements tend to be repeated more often. Accordingly, neural activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s leading to reinforcement are also reentered more frequently. Reinforcement relies on dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and animals shape their behavior to receive dopaminergic stimulation. Seeking evidence for a neural law of effect, we found that mice learn to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s that trigger optogenetic VTA self-stimulation. Learning was accompanied by gradual shaping of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s, with participating neurons progressively increasing and aligning their covariance to that of the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>. Motor cortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s that lead to phasic dopaminergic VTA activity are progressively reinforced and shaped, suggesting a mechanism by which animals select and shape actions to reliably achieve reinforcement.</p>

The Patterned Structure of Galactoglucomannan Suggests It May Bind to Cellulose in Seed Mucilage
<p>The interaction between mannan polysaccharides and cellulose microfibrils contributes to cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es in some vascular plants, but the molecular arrangement of mannan in the cell wall and the nature of the molecular bonding between mannan and cellulose remain unknown. Previous studies have shown that mannan is important in maintaining Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed mucilage architecture, and that Cellulose Synthase-Like A2 (CSLA2) synthesizes a glucomannan backbone, which Mannan α-Galactosyl Transferase1 (MAGT1/GlycosylTransferase-Like6/Mucilage Related10) might decorate with single α-Gal branches. Here, we investigated the ratio and sequence of Man and Glc and the arrangement of Gal residues in Arabidopsis mucilage mannan using enzyme sequential digestion, carbohydrate gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. We found that seed mucilage galactoglucomannan has a backbone consisting of the repeating disaccharide [4)-β-Glc-(1,4)-β-Man-(1,], and most of the Man residues in the backbone are substituted by single α-1,6-Gal. CSLA2 is responsible for the synthesis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed glucomannan backbone and MAGT1 catalyses the addition of α-Gal. In vitro activity assays revealed that MAGT1 transferred α-Gal from UDP-Gal only to Man residues within the CSLA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed glucomannan backbone acceptor. These results indicate that CSLAs and galactosyltransferases are able to make precisely defined galactoglucomannan structures. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed galactoglucomannan is able to bind stably to some hydrophilic faces and to hydrophobic faces of cellulose microfibrils. A specialization of the biosynthetic machinery to make galactoglucomannan with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed structure may therefore regulate the mode of binding of this hemicellulose to cellulose fibrils.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>-triggered immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array architecture in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>. We discovered that all nontransverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s share a common underlying array architecture, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s and morpho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical traits were shaped by heat stress. Response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of differentially expressed genes, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress genes were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Transmembrane voltage potential is an essential cellular parameter for the detection and control of tumor development in a <i>Xenopus</i> model
<p>Understanding mechanisms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage potential gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control mechanisms that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> formation. We tested the role of transmembrane potential in tumorigenesis mediated by canonical oncogenes in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Depolarized membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>) was a characteristic of induced tumor-like structures (ITLSs) generated by overexpression of <i>Gli1</i>, <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i>, <i>Xrel3</i> or <i>p53<sup>Trp248</sup></i>. This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor ITLS sites. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a bioelectric marker that reveals ITLSs before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> and significantly reduced ITLS formation <i>in vivo</i>. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> change regulates ITLS phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>-regulated activity of SLC5A8, a sodium-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of ITLSs by hyperpolarization. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a convenient cellular parameter by which tumors induced by human oncogenes can be detected <i>in vivo</i> and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane potential is functionally involved in the process by which oncogene-bearing cells depart from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> morphogenesis programs to form tumors. Modulation of <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> levels is a novel and promising strategy for tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ization.</p>

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We evaluated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic evaluation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> or mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ity). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.

Moderate and severe ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ities in both arms robustly predicted events (moderate: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99–6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC test (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ity on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64).

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host plants, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host plant, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> plants infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific plants without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled plants which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated plants and plants that were non-acclimated. Galled plants displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated plants compared with acclimated ones. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes in host plant were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical parameters in the galled plants, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes on the plant foliage, which may in turn increase plant defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host plant acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host plant, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

Transcriptional activation of elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor by corticosteroids, progesterone, and spironolactone
<p>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a nuclear receptor and part of a large and diverse family of transcription factors that also includes receptors for glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, and estrogens. The corticosteroid aldosterone is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical activator of the MR in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates; however, its activator is not known in cartilaginous fish, the oldest group of extant jawed vertebrates. Here, we analyzed the ability of corticosteroids and progesterone to activate the full-length MR from the elephant shark (<i>Callorhinchus milii</i>). On the basis of their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone, and 19-norprogesterone are potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fish. Although progesterone activates MRs in ray-finned fish, progesterone does not activate MRs in humans, amphibians, or alligator, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR. Both elephant shark MR and human MR are expressed in the brain, heart, ovary, testis, and other nonepithelial tissues, suggesting that MR expression in diverse tissues evolved in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Our data suggest that 19-norprogesterone– and progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Embryonic neural activity wires the brain
<p>The development of many sensory systems commonly involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed spontaneous activity of neurons, in which nearby neurons fire synchronously, forming waves of activity that propagate throughout a neural circuit. In concert with sensory experience and molecular factors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed spontaneous activity is critical for the formation of sensory maps, which are spatial representations in the brain of the sensory features they encode. The initial establishment of sensory maps is thought to be driven by molecular cues and later refined by neural activity, initially through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ed spontaneous activity and later by sensory-evoked activity.

Serotype-specific immunity explains the incidence of diseases caused by human enteroviruses

On the basis of our findings, we are able to predict outbreaks 2 years ahead of time (2015–2016). These results have implications for the impact of vaccines under development.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

Morphogen gradient reconstitution reveals Hedgehog pathway design principles
<p>In developing tissues, cells estimate their spatial position by sensing graded concentrations of diffusible signaling proteins called morphogens. Morphogen-sensing pathways exhibit diverse molecular architectures, whose roles in controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing dynamics and precision have been unclear. In this work, combining cell-based in vitro gradient reconstitution, genetic rewiring, and mathematical modeling, we systematically analyzed the distinctive architectural features of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. We found that the combination of double-negative regulatory logic and negative feedback through the PTCH receptor accelerates gradient formation and improves robustness to variation in the morphogen production rate compared with alternative designs. The ability to isolate morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing from concurrent developmental processes and to compare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing behaviors of alternative, rewired pathway architectures offers a powerful way to understand and engineer multicellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing.</p>

Analysis of the observed responses indicates that the underlying interpretation strategy minimizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing errors in response to the joint input of noisy opposing gradients.

<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development data and identifying developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s.</p>

Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the foundation of coral-reef ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can grow photoautotrophically, it can grow mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ly transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and alterations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes were correlated with changes in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little change in their abundances. However, the altered carbon metabolism in Glc-supplemented cells was correlated with modest alterations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy metabolism and cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes that are not reflected by major changes in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably reflect posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated positioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> position and in more distant positions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the positioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es, possibly through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">converg</span></strong>ent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of land plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving land plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing. This supports an ancient and tightly conserved genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing across land plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous land plants.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y.</p>

The IQD Family of Calmodulin-Binding Proteins Links Calcium Signaling to Microtubules, Membrane Subdomains, and the Nucleus
<p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential processes for the coordination and control of plant cell shape and cell growth. Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal sensors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The plant-specific IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular sites, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-specific localization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s coincide with the subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to specific subcellular sites for precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-specific MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell shape, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function, shape, and growth.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s and damage-associated molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s to activate innate immune signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate immune signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the immune signals that impinge on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s and damage-associated molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>s represent a conserved plant immune response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric capping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate immunity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback loop between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste development have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> development of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ly and markers of early taste development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing of taste placodes.</p>

Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule
<p>Morphogen gradients guide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing of tissues and organs during the development of multicellular organisms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for tissue growth. The consequences of this interplay between growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing are not well understood. In the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong>ing and is also required for tissue growth. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen gradient formation in a growing tissue, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen gradient scales with the growing tissue size, tissue growth becomes spatially uniform and the tissue naturally attains a finite size. This model is consistent with many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of the wing disc. However, we find that the MDDR is not consistent with the phenotype of scaling-defective mutants, supporting the view that temporal increase in Dpp signaling is not the driver of cell division during late phases of disc development. More generally, our results show that local coupling of cell division with morphogen signaling can lead to gradient scaling and uniform growth even in the absence of global feedbacks. The MDDR scaling mechanism might be particularly beneficial during rapid proliferation, when global feedbacks are hard to implement.</p>

Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> CAC score. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irregular</span></strong>ity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male athletes (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.15; <i>P</i>=0.016); 15 (14%) male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pattern</span></strong> consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> CAC scores. Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different patho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men. Coronary plaques are more abundant in athletes, whereas their stable nature could mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exercise promotes metabolic remodeling in the heart, which is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac growth; however, it is not known whether or how physical activity–induced changes in cardiac metabolism cause myocardial remodeling. In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, metabolomic, and biochemical assays to measure changes in myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic activity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, metabolism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. Metabolomic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify metabolic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic activity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase activity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase activity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, metabolic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase activity caused modest mitochondrial damage. Transcriptomic analyses showed that glycolysis regulates the expression of key genes involved in cardiac metabolism and remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Exercise-induced decreases in glycolytic activity stimulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac remodeling, and metabolic flexibility is important for maintaining mitochondrial health in the heart.</p></sec>

In Vivo Functional Selection Identifies Cardiotrophin-1 as a Cardiac Engraftment Factor for Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transplantation of cells into the infarcted heart has significant potential to improve myocardial recovery; however, low efficacy of cell engraftment still limits therapeutic benefit. Here, we describe a method for the unbiased, in vivo selection of cytokines that improve mesenchymal stromal cell engraftment into the heart both in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> conditions and after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An arrayed library of 80 secreted factors, including most of the currently known interleukins and chemokines, were individually cloned into adeno-associated viral vectors. Pools from this library were then used for the batch transduction of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo, followed by intramyocardial cell administration in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> and infarcted mice. Three weeks after injection, vector genomes were recovered from the few persisting cells and identified by sequencing DNA barcodes uniquely labeling each of the tested cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The most effective molecule identified by this competitive engraftment screening was cardiotrophin-1, a member of the interleukin-6 family. Intracardiac injection of mesenchymal stromal cells transiently preconditioned with cardiotrophin-1 preserved cardiac function and reduced infarct size, parallel to the persistence of the transplanted cells in the healing hearts for at least 2 months after injection. Engraftment of cardiotrophin-1–treated mesenchymal stromal cells was consequent to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3–mediated activation of the focal adhesion kinase and its associated focal adhesion complex and the consequent acquisition of adhesive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es by the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results support the feasibility of selecting molecules in vivo for their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es with adeno-associated viral vector libraries and identify cardiotrophin-1 as a powerful cytokine promoting cell engraftment and thus improving cell therapy of the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec>

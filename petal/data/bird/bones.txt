Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss either on both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>   (13 knees), or on either the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss on both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to regenerate bone after fin amputation. In this process, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, differentiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s do not appear to contribute to repair of bone injuries in mammals; rather, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish bone. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">skull</span></strong> injuries. In both models, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> dedifferentiation in reparative bone formation in fish and indicate that adult fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian bone-forming cells.</p>

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication remain unclear. Here, we identified that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26) increases valvular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We obtained the aortic valve tissues from humans and murine models (wild-type and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice) and cultured the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and valvular endothelial cells from the cusps. We induced osteogenic differentiation in the primary cultured VICs and examined the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor on the osteogenic changes in vitro and aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice. We also induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic stenosis in male New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) by a cholesterol-enriched diet+vitamin D2 (25 000 IU, daily). Echocardiography was performed to assess the aortic valve area and the maximal and mean transaortic pressure gradients at baseline and 3-week intervals thereafter. After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric oxide depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs. Consequently, the NF-κB promotes DPP-4 expression, which then induces the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. The inhibition of DPP-4 enzymatic activity blocked the osteogenic changes in VICs in vitro and reduced the aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication in vivo in a mouse model. Sitagliptin administration in a rabbit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease model led to significant improvements in the rate of change in aortic valve area, transaortic peak velocity, and maximal and mean pressure gradients over 12 weeks. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the therapeutic effect of Sitagliptin in terms of reducing the calcium deposits in the rabbit aortic valve cusps. In rabbits receiving Sitagliptin, the plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 levels were significantly increased, in line with DPP-4 inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DPP-4-dependent insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibition in VICs contributes to aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication, suggesting that DPP-4 could serve as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease progression.</p></sec>

Increased activity of TNAP compensates for reduced adenosine production and promotes ectopic calcification in the genetic disease ACDC
<p>ACDC (arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication due to deficiency of CD73) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from loss-of-function mutations in <i>NT5E</i>, which encodes CD73, a 5′-ectonucleotidase that converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate to adenosine. ACDC patients display progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication of lower extremity arteries, causing limb ischemia. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which converts pyrophosphate (PPi) to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and extracellular purine metabolism play important roles in other inherited forms of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. Compared to cells from healthy subjects, induced pluripotent stem cell–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) from ACDC patients displayed accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication and increased TNAP activity when cultured under conditions that promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteogenesi</span></strong>s. TNAP activity generated adenosine in iMSCs derived from ACDC patients but not in iMSCs from control subjects, which have CD73. In response to osteogenic stimulation, ACDC patient–derived iMSCs had decreased amounts of the TNAP substrate PPi, an inhibitor of extracellular matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication, and exhibited increased activation of AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), a pathway that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. In vivo, teratomas derived from ACDC patient cells showed extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication and increased TNAP activity. Treating mice bearing these teratomas with an A2b adenosine receptor agonist, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or the bisphosphonate etidronate reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. These results show that an increase of TNAP activity in ACDC contributes to ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication by disrupting the extracellular balance of PPi and Pi and identify potential therapeutic targets for ACDC.</p>

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the effect of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the effect of light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene <i>FMR1</i> on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> structure, and caused disease-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with abnormal dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of <i>Fmr1</i>-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> phenotype and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> density associated with FXS.</p>

Pin1 mediates Aβ<sub>42</sub>-induced dendritic spine loss
<p>Early-stage Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the loss of dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s in the neocortex of the brain. This phenomenon precedes tau pathology, plaque formation, and neurodegeneration and likely contributes to synaptic loss, memory impairment, and behavioral changes in patients. Studies suggest that dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> loss is induced by soluble, multimeric amyloid-β (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), which, through postsynaptic signaling, activates the protein phosphatase calcineurin. We investigated how calcineurin caused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> pathology and found that the cis-trans prolyl isomerase Pin1 was a critical downstream target of Aβ<sub>42</sub>-calcineurin signaling. In dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s, Pin1 interacted with and was dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which rapidly suppressed its isomerase activity. Knockout of Pin1 or exposure to Aβ<sub>42</sub> induced the loss of mature dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s, which was prevented by exogenous Pin1. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocked dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> loss in Aβ<sub>42</sub>-treated wild-type cells but had no effect on <i>Pin1</i>-null neurons. These data implicate Pin1 in dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> maintenance and synaptic loss in early Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoporosi</span></strong>s and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoporosi</span></strong>s, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s in aged mice showed a similar number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong>s compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoporosi</span></strong>s.</p>

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils
<p>Bone marrow–derived myeloid cells can accumulate within tumors and foster cancer outgrowth. Local immune-neoplastic interactions have been intensively investigated, but the contribution of the systemic host environment to tumor growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show in mice and cancer patients (<i>n</i> = 70) that lung adenocarcinomas increase bone stromal activity in the absence of bone metastasis. Animal studies reveal that the cancer-induced bone phenotype involves bone-resident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteocalcin</span></strong>-expressing (Ocn<sup>+</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>ic cells. These cells promote cancer by remotely supplying a distinct subset of tumor-infiltrating SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils, which exhibit cancer-promoting properties. Experimentally reducing Ocn<sup>+</sup> cell numbers suppresses the neutrophil response and lung tumor outgrowth.

Human-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exoskeleton</span></strong>s and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded. Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exoskeleton</span></strong> assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exoskeleton</span></strong> worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exoskeleton</span></strong>s worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.</p>

Pre-operative functional status as a predictor of morbidity and mortality after elective cervical spine surgery
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients seeking cervical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> surgery are thought to be increasing   in age, comorbidities and functional debilitation.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arthriti</span></strong>s   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss documented   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs.

However,   if a patient does have full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs.

Measuring the migration of the components and polyethylene wear after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong>   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the components and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Osteoarticular tissue infection and development of skeletal pathology in murine brucellosis
<p>Brucellosis, a frequent bacterial zoonosis, can produce debilitating chronic disease with involvement of multiple organs in human patients. Whereas acute brucellosis is well studied using the murine animal model, long-term complications of host-pathogen interaction remain largely elusive. Human brucellosis frequently results in persistent, chronic osteoarticular system involvement, with complications such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arthriti</span></strong>s, spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Here, we focused on identifying infectious sites in the mouse that parallel <i>Brucella melitensis</i> foci observed in patients. <i>In vivo</i> imaging showed rapid bacterial dispersal to multiple sites of the murine axial skeleton. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of bacteria in bones and limbs, and in the lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> vertebrae of the axial skeleton where they were preferentially located in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>. Surprisingly, some animals developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arthriti</span></strong>s in paws and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> after infection, but without obvious bacteria in these sites. The identification of <i>Brucella</i> in the bones of mice corroborates the findings in humans that these osteoarticular sites are important niches for the persistence of <i>Brucella</i> in the host, but the mechanisms that mediate pathological manifestations in these sites remain unclear. Future studies addressing the immune responses within osteoarticular tissue foci could elucidate important tissue injury mediators and <i>Brucella</i> survival strategies.</p>

The development of zebrafish tendon and ligament progenitors
<p>Despite the importance of tendons and ligaments for transmitting movement and providing stability to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">musculoskeletal system</span></strong>, their development is considerably less well understood than that of the tissues they serve to connect. Zebrafish have been widely used to address questions in muscle and skeletal development, yet few studies describe their tendon and ligament tissues. We have analyzed in zebrafish the expression of several genes known to be enriched in mammalian tendons and ligaments, including <i>scleraxis</i> (<i>scx</i>), <i>collagen 1a2</i> (<i>col1a2</i>) and <i>tenomodulin</i> (<i>tnmd</i>), or in the tendon-like myosepta of the zebrafish (<i>xirp2a</i>). Co-expression studies with muscle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e markers demonstrate the presence of <i>scxa</i>, <i>col1a2</i> and <i>tnmd</i> at sites between the developing muscle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e, and <i>xirp2a</i> at the myotendinous junctions. We determined that the zebrafish craniofacial tendon and ligament progenitors are neural crest derived, as in mammals. Cranial and fin tendon progenitors can be induced in the absence of differentiated muscle or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e, although neighboring muscle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e are required for tendon cell maintenance and organization, respectively. By contrast, myoseptal <i>scxa</i> expression requires muscle for its initiation. Together, these data suggest a conserved role for muscle in tendon development. Based on the similarities in gene expression, morphology, collagen ultrastructural arrangement and developmental regulation with that of mammalian tendons, we conclude that the zebrafish tendon populations are homologous to their force-transmitting counterparts in higher vertebrates. Within this context, the zebrafish model can be used to provide new avenues for studying tendon biology in a vertebrate genetic system.</p>

Altered DNA Methylation of Long Noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Promotes Mineralization by Silencing <i>NOTCH1</i>
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal mineralization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of <i>NOTCH1</i>, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to document the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to document the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We documented that lncRNA <i>H19 (H19</i>) was increased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with <i>H19</i> expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that <i>H19</i> induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that <i>H19</i> silenced <i>NOTCH1</i> by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of <i>H19</i> in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> and decreased the level of <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>, 2 downstream targets repressed by <i>NOTCH1</i>. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented <i>H19</i>-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of <i>H19</i> during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ic aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of <i>NOTCH1.</i></p></sec>

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo
<p>Plasticity of cortical responses in vivo involves activity-dependent changes at synapses, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic plasticity act together to create functional changes in neurons remains unknown. We found that spike timing–induced receptive field plasticity of visual cortex neurons in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic strength of identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s. This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>s involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century
<p>Ocean acidification refers to the lowering of the ocean’s pH due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Coral reef <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication is expected to decrease as the oceans become more acidic. Dissolving calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) sands could greatly exacerbate reef loss associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication but is presently poorly constrained. Here we show that CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution in reef sediments across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state (Ω<sub>ar</sub>) of overlying seawater and that CaCO<sub>3</sub> sediment dissolution is 10-fold more sensitive to ocean acidification than coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcif</span></strong>ication. Consequently, reef sediments globally will transition from net precipitation to net dissolution when seawater Ω<sub>ar</sub> reaches 2.92 ± 0.16 (expected circa 2050 CE). Notably, some reefs are already experiencing net sediment dissolution.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamella</span></strong>e of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamella</span></strong>. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamella</span></strong>, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong>   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and modes of failure. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arthriti</span></strong>s progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64).

The objective of this study   was make a prospective assessment of the safety of our early appropriate   care (EAC) strategy and to evaluate the potential benefit of additional   laboratory data to determine readiness for surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A cohort of 335 patients with fractures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s, acetabulum,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong>, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> were included. Patients underwent definitive fixation   within 36 hours if one of the following three parameters were met:   lactate < 4.0 mmol/L; pH ≥ 7.25; or base excess (BE) ≥ -5.5 mmol/L.   If all three parameters were met, resuscitation was designated full   protocol resuscitation (FPR). If less than all three parameters   were met, it was designated an incomplete protocol resuscitation   (IPR). Complications were assessed by an independent adjudication   committee and included infection; sepsis; PE/DVT; organ failure;   pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 66 patients (19.7%) developed 90 complications. An   historical cohort of 1441 patients had a complication rate of 22.1%.   The complication rate for patients with only one EAC parameter at   the point of protocol was 34.3%, which was higher than other groups   (p = 0.041).

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> in nine, the distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> in 13 and the proximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong> in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a mean of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of bone are required in the surgical   management of tumours, and in revision cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

Accuracy of CT-navigated pedicle screw positioning in the cervical and upper thoracic region with and without prior anterior surgery and ventral plating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to retrospectively assess the accuracy and safety of   CT navigated pedicle screws and to compare accuracy in the cervical   and thoracic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> (C2-T8) with (COMB) and without (POST) prior   anterior surgery (anterior cervical discectomy or corpectomy and   fusion with ventral plating: ACDF/ACCF).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 592 pedicle screws, which were used in 107 consecutively   operated patients (210 COMB, 382 POST), were analysed. The accuracy   of positioning was determined according to the classification of   Gertzbein and Robbins on post-operative CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High accuracy was achieved in 524 screws (88.5%), 192 (87.7%)   in the cervical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong> and 332 (89%) in the thoracic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spine</span></strong>, respectively.   The results in the two surgical groups were compared and a logistic   regression mixed model was performed to analyse the risk of low   accuracy. Significantly lower accuracy was found in the COMB group   with 82.9% <i>versus</i> 91.6% in the POST group (p =   0.036). There were no neurological complications, but two vertebral artery   lesions were recorded. Three patients underwent revision surgery   for malpositioning of a screw.

A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a mean   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The mean follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved recording pain on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.   Any adverse effects were documented with particular emphasis on   residual pain, limitation of movement, infection, dislocation and   the need for revision surgery.</p><p>Radiographic assessment was performed pre-operatively and at   three, six and 12 months post-operatively, and annually thereafter.

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femoro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong> and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l   plateau. This method evaluates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong>s displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of normal knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications. Accordingly, caution   should be observed in generalizing our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:50–5.</p></sec>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain data are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">skull</span></strong> morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data recorded from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously recorded bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">skull</span></strong> morphology.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>e. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>e of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified.

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>c chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing risk model, our objective   was to identify risk factors for the development of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 years (one week to 23.1 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died. Overall survival was 76%, 55% and 45% at one, five and   ten years post-operatively, respectively. In a competing risk model   the cumulative risk of the development of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one year, post-operatively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic reconstruction was a significant risk factor for   the development of complications (p = 0.006). Complications were   not significantly related to age or the location or grade of the   tumour (p = 0.823, p = 0.976, p = 0.858).

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong> fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong> fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Total hip arthroplasty using a monobloc cementless femoral stem for patients with childhood Perthes’ disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Modular or custom-made femoral components have been preferred   for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with a history of Perthes’   disease because of the distortion in the anatomy of the proximal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong>. However, it has not been established whether a monobloc cementless   stem will fit the distorted proximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> or whether the results   of the procedure are satisfactory in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 68 consecutive patients who had undergone THA for   childhood Perthes’ disease between June 2003 and December 2008.   There were 35 men and 33 women with a mean age of 48 years (16 to   73) at the time of index arthroplasty. Their mean body mass index   was 24.4 (18.3 to 32.9). Of the 68 hips, 32 were classified as Stulberg   class III and 36 as class IV. The mean pre-operative shortening   of the affected leg was 17.2 mm (5 to 34). The minimum follow-up   was five years (mean 8.5 years; 5.2 to 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An intra-operative calcar fracture occurred in eight hips (11.8%)   and was successfully treated by cerclage wiring. The mean stem version   was 14.6° (-2.3 to 30; standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 7.3). The   mean acetabular component abduction was 40.2° (23.7 to 56.0; <sc>sd</sc> 6.5)   and the mean anteversion 28.3° (6.4 to 43.0; <sc>sd</sc> 7.6), respectively.   The mean follow-up was 8.5 years (5.2 to 10). No dislocations occurred   and no hips were revised during the course of the study. At final   follow-up, the mean Harris Hip Score was 91 points (59 to 100) and   the mean University of California, Los Angeles activity score was   3.2 (2 to 8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monobloc cementless stems reliably restore the anatomy in Perthes’   disease at THA without the need for custom-made or modular implants.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:440–444.</p></sec>

Bone penetration of intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin as antibiotic prophylaxis during total hip and knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate the bone penetration of intravenous antibiotic   prophylaxis with flucloxacillin and gentamicin during hip and knee   arthroplasty, and their efficacy against <i>Staphylococcus</i> (<i>S.</i>) <i>aureus</i> and <i>S.   epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Bone samples from the femoral head, neck and acetabulum were   collected from 18 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong> in 21 patients during total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). The concentration of both antibiotics in the samples was   analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. Penetration   was expressed as a percentage of venous blood concentration. The   efficacy against common infecting organisms was measured against   both the minimum inhibitory concentration 50, and the more stringent epidemiological   cutoff value for resistance (ECOFF).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The bone penetration of gentamicin was higher than flucloxacillin.   Relative to ECOFF, flucloxacillin concentrations were effective   against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. epidermidis</i> in   all THAs and 20 (95%) TKAs. Gentamicin concentrations were effective   against <i>S. epidermidis</i> in all bone samples. Gentamicin   was effective against <i>S. aureus</i> in 11 (61.1%) femoral   neck samples in THA. Effective concentrations of gentamicin against <i>S.   aureus</i> were only achieved in four (19%) femoral and six   (29%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tibia</span></strong>l samples in TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Flucloxacillin and gentamicin were found to penetrate bone during   THA and TKA. Gentamicin was effective against <i>S. epidermidis</i> in   both THA and TKA, while levels were subtherapeutic against <i>S.   aureus</i> in most TKAs. Bone penetration of both antibiotics   was less in TKA than THA, and may relate to the use of a tourniquet.   Using this antibiotic combination, effective cover against the two   common infective organisms was achieved in all THAs and all but   one TKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:358–64.</p></sec>

Instability of the hip after anatomical  re-alignment in patients with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Several studies have reported the safety and efficacy of subcapital   re-alignment for patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis   (SCFE) using surgical dislocation of the hip and an extended retinacular   flap. Instability of the hip and dislocation as a consequence of   this surgery has only recently gained attention. We discuss this   problem with some illustrative cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We explored the literature on the possible pathophysiological   causes and surgical steps associated with the risk of post-operative   instability and articular damage. In addition, we describe supplementary   steps that could be used to avoid these problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The causes of instability may be divided into three main groups:   the first includes causes directly related to SCFE (acetabular labral   damage, severe abrasion of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cartilag</span></strong>e, flattening   of the acetabular roof and a bell-shaped deformity of the epiphysis);   the second, causes not related to the SCFE (acetabular orientation   and poor quality of the soft tissues); the third, causes directly   related to the surgery (capsulotomy, division of the ligamentum teres,   shortening of the femoral neck, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>-trochanteric impingement,   previous proximal femoral osteotomy and post-operative positioning   of the leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present examples drawn from our clinical practice, as well   as possible ways of reducing the risks of these complications, and   of correcting them if they happen.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:16–21.</p></sec>

Metaphyseal debonding of the Corail collarless cementless stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Corail stem has good long-term results. After four years   of using this stem, we have detected a small group of patients who   have presented with symptomatic metaphyseal debonding. The aim of   this study was to quantify the incidence of this complication, to   delineate the characteristics of patients presenting with this complication   and to compare these patients with asymptomatic controls to determine   any important predisposing factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Of 855 Corail collarless cementless stems implanted for osteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arthriti</span></strong>s,   18 presented with symptomatic metaphyseal debonding.

Monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur
<p>Monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the proximal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong> has a variable clinical course, despite its reported limited tendency   to progress.</p><p>We investigated the natural history and predisposing factors   for progression of dysplasia in a group of 76 patients with a mean   follow-up of 8.5 years (2.0 to 15.2). Of these, 31 (41%) presented   with an asymptomatic incidental lesion while 45 (59%) presented   with pain or a pathological fracture.

Three-dimensional morphology and bony range of movement in hip joints in patients with hip dysplasia
<p>To confirm whether developmental dysplasia of   the hip has a risk of hip impingement, we analysed maximum ranges   of movement to the point of bony impingement, and impingement location   using three-dimensional (3D) surface models of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femur</span></strong>   in combination with 3D morphology of the hip joint using computer-assisted methods.   Results of computed tomography were examined for 52 hip joints with   DDH and 73 normal healthy hip joints. DDH shows larger maximum extension   (p = 0.001) and internal rotation at 90° flexion (p < 0.001).   Similar maximum flexion (p = 0.835) and external rotation (p = 0.713)   were observed between groups, while high rates of extra-articular   impingement were noticed in these directions in DDH (p < 0.001).   Smaller cranial acetabular anteversion (p = 0.048), centre-edge   angles (p < 0.001), a circumferentially shallower acetabulum,   larger femoral neck anteversion (p < 0.001), and larger alpha   angle were identified in DDH. Risk of anterior impingement in retroverted   DDH hips is similar to that in retroverted normal hips in excessive   adduction but minimal in less adduction. These findings might be   borne in mind when considering the possibility of extra-articular   posterior impingement in DDH being a source of pain, particularly   for patients with a highly anteverted femoral neck.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:580–9.</p>

Mid-term outcomes of routine proximal row carpectomy compared with proximal row carpectomy with dorsal capsular interposition arthroplasty for the treatment of late-stage arthropathy of the wrist

This group of patients were matched 1:2 with a group of   50 wrists (48 patients) without degenerative changes in the capitate   or lunate fossa that were treated with a routine PRC alone during   the same period. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery   was 56.8 years (25 to 81), and the demographics and baseline range   of movement of the wrist, grip strength, Quick Disabilities of the   Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score, and Patient-Rated Wrist   Evaluation (PRWE) score were similar in both groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 5.9 years (1.8 to 11.8), significant improvements   in mean grip strength, the flexion-extension arc of movement of   the wrist, QuickDASH, and PRWE scores were seen in both groups.   There was no diifference between the groups for any of the outcomes.   One patient in the PRC + DCI group required additional surgery for   a deep infection, while two in the PRC group had complications (one   wound dehiscence requiring revision closure, one transient radial   sensory neuritis).

From shape to cells: mouse models reveal mechanisms altering palate development in Apert syndrome
<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">skull</span></strong> malformations and caused by one of two missense mutations, S252W and P253R, on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The molecular bases underlying differential Apert syndrome phenotypes are still poorly understood and it is unclear why cleft palate is more frequent in patients carrying the S252W mutation. Taking advantage of Apert syndrome mouse models, we performed a novel combination of morphometric, histological and immunohistochemical analyses to precisely quantify distinct palatal phenotypes in <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> and <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></i> mice. We localized regions of differentially altered FGF signaling and assessed local cell patterns to establish a baseline for understanding the differential effects of these two <i>Fgfr2</i> mutations. Palatal suture scoring and comparative 3D shape analysis from high resolution μCT images of 120 newborn mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">skull</span></strong>s showed that <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> mice display relatively more severe palate dysmorphologies, with contracted and more separated palatal shelves, a greater tendency to fuse the maxillary-palatine sutures and aberrant development of the inter-premaxillary suture. These palatal defects are associated with suture-specific patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The posterior region of the developing palate emerges as a potential target for therapeutic strategies in clinical management of cleft palate in Apert syndrome patients.</p>

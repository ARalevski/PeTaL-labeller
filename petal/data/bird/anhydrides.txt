Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and its major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Both compounds preserved linolenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Different levels of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of lipids, carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was consumed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a chemical quencher of ROS. The anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation process. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, contrary to carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivatives of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> takes place in planta.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulates. In addition, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> from orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and farnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the proteome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative modifications of proteins caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the identity of proteins and the residues sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified cysteines sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or its modified form, pyrethric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids (glycerides, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 559 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 365 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 295 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> peroxisomal β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and the regulatory network controlling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases are a multigene family of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases (AAO1–AAO4) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to the phytohormone abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation when another substrate was available and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, possibly by facilitating high β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation flux by maintaining a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized matrix.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway. Shade treatment did not change salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels, indicating that the mediation of shade avoidance by salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is not dependent on the modulation of salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels. These results demonstrate that salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are then used to generate plastidial lipids that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of certain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Cytosolic and Chloroplastic DHARs Cooperate in Oxidative Stress-Driven Activation of the Salicylic Acid Pathway
<p>The complexity of plant anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative systems gives rise to many unresolved questions. One relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs) in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione. To investigate this issue, we produced a complete set of loss-of-function mutants for the three annotated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) DHARs. The combined loss of <i>DHAR1</i> and <i>DHAR3</i> expression decreased extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions. An analysis of the subcellular localization of the DHARs in Arabidopsis lines stably transformed with GFP fusion proteins revealed that DHAR1 and DHAR2 are cytosolic while DHAR3 is chloroplastic, with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations. When the mutations were introduced into an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress genetic background (<i>cat2</i>), the <i>dhar1 dhar2</i> combination decreased glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and inhibited <i>cat2</i>-triggered induction of the salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway. These effects were reversed in <i>cat2 dhar1 dhar2 dhar3</i> complemented with any of the three DHARs. The data suggest that (1) DHAR can be decreased to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools, (2) the cytosolic isoforms are particularly important in coupling intracellular hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e metabolism to glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, and (3) DHAR-dependent glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation influences redox-driven salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulation.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to activate PhoP in mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to activate PhoP under mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to activate PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP activation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH, PhoP activation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

Non-Enzymatic Synthesis of Bioactive Isoprostanoids in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i> following Oxidative Stress
<p>The ecological success of diatoms requires a remarkable ability to survive many types of stress, including variations in temperature, light, salinity, and nutrient availability. On exposure to these stresses, diatoms exhibit common responses, including growth arrest, impairment of photosynthesis, production of reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG). We studied the production of cyclopentane oxylipins derived from fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. <i>P. tricornutum</i> lacks the enzymatic pathway for producing cyclopentane-oxylipins, such as jasmonate, prostaglandins, or thromboxanes. In cells subjected to increasing doses of hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), we detected nonenzymatic production of isoprostanoids, including six phytoprostanes, three F<sub>2t</sub>-isoprostanes, two F<sub>3t</sub>-isoprostanes, and three F<sub>4t</sub>-neuroprostanes, by radical per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of α-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexanoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, respectively. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also triggered photosynthesis impairment and TAG accumulation. F<sub>1t</sub>-phytoprostanes constitute the major class detected (300 pmol per 1 million cells; intracellular concentration, ∼4 µ<sc>m</sc>). Only two glycerolipids, phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerylhydroxymethyl-trimethyl-alanine, could provide all substrates for these isoprostanoids. Treatment of <i>P. tricornutum</i> with nine synthetic isoprostanoids produced an effect in the micromolar range, marked by the accumulation of TAG and reduced growth, without affecting photosynthesis. Therefore, the emission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals upon exposure to stresses can lead to glycerolipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and nonenzymatic synthesis of isoprostanoids, inhibiting growth and contributing to the induction of TAG accumulation via unknown processes. This characterization of nonenzymatic oxylipins in <i>P. tricornutum</i> opens a field of research on the study of processes controlled by isoprostanoid signaling in various physiological and environmental contexts in diatoms.</p>

Reactive oxygen species induce virus-independent MAVS oligomerization in systemic lupus erythematosus
<p>The increased expression of genes induced by type I interferon (IFN) is characteristic of viral infections and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We showed that mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which normally forms a complex with retinoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> gene I (RIG-I)–like helicases during viral infection, was activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress independently of RIG-I helicases. We found that chemically generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress stimulated the formation of MAVS oligomers, which led to mitochondrial hyperpolarization and decreased adenosine triphosphate production and spare respiratory capacity, responses that were not observed in similarly treated cells lacking MAVS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of SLE patients also showed spontaneous MAVS oligomerization that correlated with the increased secretion of type I IFN and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondria-targeted anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant MitoQ prevented MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production. ROS-dependent MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production were reduced in cells expressing the MAVS-C79F variant, which occurs in 30% of sub-Saharan Africans and is linked with reduced type I IFN secretion and milder disease in SLE patients. Patients expressing the MAVS-C79F variant also had reduced amounts of oligomerized MAVS in their plasma compared to healthy controls. Together, our findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress–induced MAVS oligomerization in SLE patients may contribute to the type I IFN signature that is characteristic of this syndrome.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress using separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas activation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, activation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s that activate the sweet taste receptor. In addition to inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation, <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s derived from <i>Staphylococcus</i> inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by activating T1R2/3. <sc>d</sc>-Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–mediated activation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the presence of the bitter receptor–activating compound denatonium benzoate.

Natural noncanonical protein splicing yields products with diverse β-amino acid residues
<p>Current textbook knowledge holds that the structural scope of ribosomal biosynthesis is based exclusively on α-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> backbone topology. Here we report the genome-guided discovery of bacterial pathways that posttranslationally create β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–containing products. The transformation is widespread in bacteria and is catalyzed by an enzyme belonging to a previously uncharacterized radical <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine family. We show that the β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s result from an unusual protein splicing process involving backbone carbon-carbon bond cleavage and net excision of tyramine. The reaction can be used to incorporate diverse and multiple β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into genetically encoded precursors in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. In addition to enlarging the set of basic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> components, the excision generates keto functions that are useful as orthogonal reaction sites for chemical diversification.</p>

Lysosomal metabolomics reveals V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent regulation of amino acid efflux from lysosomes
<p>The lysosome degrades and recycles macromolecules, signals to the cytosol and nucleus, and is implicated in many diseases. Here, we describe a method for the rapid isolation of mammalian lysosomes and use it to quantitatively profile lysosomal metabolites under various cell states. Under nutrient-replete conditions, many lysosomal amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are in rapid exchange with those in the cytosol. Loss of lysosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ification through inhibition of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) increased the luminal concentrations of most metabolites but had no effect on those of the majority of essential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Instead, nutrient starvation regulates the lysosomal concentrations of these amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, an effect we traced to regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibition of mTOR strongly reduced the lysosomal efflux of most essential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, converting the lysosome into a cellular depot for them. These results reveal the dynamic nature of lysosomal metabolites and that V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent mechanisms exist for controlling lysosomal amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> efflux.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e. We isolated the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid metal–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods.

Decarboxylative borylation

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are often introduced by Δ12 oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

Nodulin Intrinsic Protein 7;1 Is a Tapetal Boric Acid Channel Involved in Pollen Cell Wall Formation
<p>Boron is an essential plant micronutrient that plays a structural role in the rhamnogalacturonan II component of the pectic cell wall. To prevent boron deficiency under limiting conditions, its uptake, distribution, and homeostasis are mediated by boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporters and channel proteins. Among the membrane channels that facilitate boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> uptake are the type II nodulin intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of aquaporin-like proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses three NIP II genes (<i>NIP5;1</i>, <i>NIP6;1</i>, and <i>NIP7;1</i>) that show distinct tissue expression profiles (predominantly expressed in roots, stem nodes, and developing flowers, respectively). Orthologs of each are represented in all dicots. Here, we show that purified and reconstituted NIP7;1 is a boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> facilitator. By using native promoter-reporter fusions, we show that NIP7;1 is expressed predominantly in anthers of young flowers in a narrow developmental window, floral stages 9 and 10, with protein accumulation solely within tapetum cells, where it is localized to the plasma membrane. Under limiting boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> conditions, loss-of-function T-DNA mutants (<i>nip7;1-1</i> and <i>nip7;1-2</i>) show reduced fertility, including shorter siliques and an increase in aborted seeds, compared with the wild type. Under these conditions, <i>nip7;1</i> mutant pollen grains show morphological defects, increased aggregation, defective exine cell wall formation, reduced germination frequency, and decreased viability. During stages 9 and 10, the tapetum is essential for supplying materials to the pollen microspore cell wall. We propose that NIP7;1 serves as a gated boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> channel in developing anthers that aids in the uptake of this critical micronutrient by tapetal cells.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates
<p>The cyanide-insensitive alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase (AOX) is a non-proton-pumping ubiquinol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and is posttranslationally regulated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational regulation. Seven tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in regulation by the 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>olysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis

DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in plant immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of DMR6 as a salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the formation of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 position of its phenyl ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibition property that may enable automatic control of its enzyme activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display phenotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing plants, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages. Collectively, our results disclose the identity of the enzyme required for 2,5-DHBA formation and reveal a mechanism by which plants fine-tune SA homeostasis by mediating SA 5-hydroxylation.</p>

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase Is Involved in Both, Valine and Isoleucine Degradation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>In plants, amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism is especially relevant in metabolic stress situations (e.g. limited carbohydrate availability during extended darkness). Under these conditions, amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are used as alternative substrates for respiration. Complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) in the mitochondria efficiently allows the formation of ATP by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative phosphorylation. However, the metabolic pathways for BCAA breakdown are largely unknown so far in plants. A systematic search for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes encoding proteins resembling enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in animals, fungi, and bacteria as well as proteomic analyses of mitochondrial fractions from Arabidopsis allowed the identification of a putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, AtHDH1 (At4g20930), involved in Val degradation. Systematic substrate screening analyses revealed that the protein uses 3-hydroxyisobutyrate but additionally 3-hydroxypropionate as substrates. This points to a role of the enzyme not only in Val but possibly also in Ile metabolism. At4g20930 knockdown plants were characterized to test this conclusion. Root toxicity assays revealed increased root growth inhibition of the mutants if cultivated in the presence of Val or Ile but not in the presence of leucine. We conclude that AtHDH1 has a dual role in BCAA metabolism in plants.</p>

The gene coded for a 533-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> polypeptide with moderate homologies to flavin adenine dinucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases from other plants. The primary structure contained an amino-terminal signal peptide and conserved amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> residues to form bicovalent linkage to the flavin adenine dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring at histidine-112 and cysteine-175. In addition, the recombinant DCA synthase, purified from the culture supernatant of transgenic <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, exhibited structural and functional properties as a flavoprotein. The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, based on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic space, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant hormone responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in vegetative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant hormones indoleacetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and gibberellic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, such as decanoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (10:0). These seed oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich seed oils.</p>

Defense Responses in Aspen with Altered Pectin Methylesterase Activity Reveal the Hormonal Inducers of Tyloses
<p>Tyloses are ingrowths of parenchyma cells into the lumen of embolized xylem vessels, thereby protecting the remaining xylem from pathogens. They are found in heartwood, sapwood, and in abscission zones and can be induced by various stresses, but their molecular triggers are unknown. Here, we report that down-regulation of <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE1</i> (<i>PtxtPME1</i>) in aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>tremuloides</i>) triggers the formation of tyloses and activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. We tested whether any of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress-related hormones could induce tyloses in intact plantlets grown in sterile culture. Jasmonates, including jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (JA) and methyl jasmonate, induced the formation of tyloses, whereas treatments with salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (ACC) were ineffective. SA abolished the induction of tyloses by JA, whereas ACC was synergistic with JA. The ability of ACC to stimulate tyloses formation when combined with JA depended on ethylene (ET) signaling, as shown by a decrease in the response in ET-insensitive plants. Measurements of internal ACC and JA concentrations in wild-type and ET-insensitive plants treated simultaneously with these two compounds indicated that ACC and JA regulate each other’s concentration in an ET-dependent manner. The findings indicate that jasmonates acting synergistically with ethylene are the key molecular triggers of tyloses.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic electron transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase (FNR) transfers electrons from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic electron transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on electron transport and super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e production, and perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast disease, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important disease of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice blast disease, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast disease. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The application of α-linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> rescued disease symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast disease.</p>

Modulation of Plant Salicylic Acid-Associated Immune Responses via Glycosylation of Dihydroxybenzoic Acids
<p>Salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (SA) plays a crucial role in plant innate immunity. The deployment of SA-associated immune responses is primarily affected by SA concentration, which is determined by a balance between SA biosynthesis and catabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating SA homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a unique UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT76D1, which plays an important role in SA homeostasis and associated immune responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Expression of <i>UGT76D1</i> was induced by treatment with both the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 and SA. Overexpression of <i>UGT76D1</i> resulted in high SA accumulation, significant up-regulation of pathogen-related genes, and a hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesion mimic phenotype. This HR-like phenotype was not observed following <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression in SA-deficient <i>NahG</i> transgenic or <i>sid2</i> plants, suggesting that the phenotype is SA dependent. Biochemical assays showed that UGT76D1 glycosylated 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (2,3-DHBA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (2,5-DHBA), the major catabolic forms of SA, to their Glc and Xyl conjugates in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a mutant background blocked in the formation of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression did not cause a HR-like lesion mimic phenotype. Following infection with <i>Pst</i> DC3000, <i>UGT76D1</i> knockout mutants displayed a delayed immune response, with reduced levels of DHBA glycosides and SA, and down-regulated SA synthase expression. By contrast, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression lines showed an enhanced immune response and increased SA biosynthesis before and after pathogen infection. Thus, we propose that UGT76D1 plays an important role in SA homeostasis and plant immune responses by facilitating glycosylation of dihydroxybenzoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s.</p>

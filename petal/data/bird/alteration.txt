Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery of metal-on-metal   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to metal   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion were   intra-operative complications, mortality and re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery.   Predictors of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operative complications occurred in 40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion were   high body mass index at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), ceramic-on-ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion bearings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07). These four factors remained predictive   of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion when the missing data were imputed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The short-term risk of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion following MoMHA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery   performed for ARMD was comparable with that reported in the NJR   following all-cause non-MoMHA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery. However, the factors   predictive of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion included those which could be modified   by the surgeon, suggesting that rates of failure following ARMD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   may be reduced further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1020–7.</p></sec>

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of UKA to TKA.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-operations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-operations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions with modular   component exchange, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions with non-modular component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-operation, modular   component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion and non-modular component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-operation were: post-operative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%). The most common indications for non-modular   component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion were chronic PJI (52%), aseptic loosening (17%), periprosthetic   fracture (10%), and instability (10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Post-operative stiffness remains the most common indication for   re-operation after TKA. Infection is the most common indication   for modular and non-modular component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion. Aseptic loosening   was not an uncommon cause of failure, however, it was much less   common than in national registry and non-registry data.

Comparative study of computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty after opening wedge osteotomy <i>versus</i> after unicompartmental arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The role of high tibial osteotomy (HTO) is being questioned by   the use of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in the treatment   of medial compartment femorotibial osteoarthritis. Our aim was to   compare the outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion HTO or UKA to a total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) using computer-assisted surgery in matched groups of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We conducted a retrospective study to compare the clinical and   radiological outcome of patients who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of a HTO   to a TKA (group 1) with those who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of a medial   UKA to a TKA (group 2). All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion procedures were performed using   computer-assisted surgery. We extracted these groups of patients   from our database. They were matched by age, gender, body mass index,   follow-up and pre-operative functional score. The outcomes included   the Knee Society Scores (KSS), radiological outcomes and the rate   of further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 20 knees in 20 patients in each group.

Functional outcome of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in periprosthetic joint infection involving the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advocates of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) argue that a procedure   not disturbing a sound prosthesis-bone interface is likely to lead   to better survival and functional outcome compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion.   This case-control study aims were to compare outcome of DAIRs for   infected primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with outcomes following   primary THA and two-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of infected primary THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all DAIRs, performed for confirmed   infected primary hip arthropasty (n = 82) at out institution, between   1997 and 2013. Data recorded included full patient information and   type of surgery. Outcome measures included complications, mortality,   implant survivorship and functional outcome. Outcome was compared with   two control groups matched for gender and age; a cohort of primary   THAs (n = 120) and a cohort of two-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions for infection   (n = 66).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean age at DAIR was 69 years (33 to 87) and mean follow-up was   eight years (2 to 17; standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 5). A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of infection with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of modular components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of infection, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion groups. For   hips with successful eradication of infection with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior mean Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better mean OHS compared with the two-stage   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008). Patients who required   only one DAIR for eradication of infection had a similar mean OHS   (41; 20 to 48) to the primary THA group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DAIR procedure is associated with a similar complication   rate and ability to eradicate infection as two-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion. This   study emphasises the need for exchange of modular components for   improved chances of eradication of infection. This is the first   study showing that DAIR is better than a two-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion regarding   functional outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:614–22.</p></sec>

Cement-in-cement revision of the femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Compared with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   surgery can be challenging. The cement-in-cement femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   technique involves removing a femoral component from a well-fixed   femoral cement mantle and cementing a new stem into the original   mantle. This technique is widely used and when carried out for the   correct indications, is fast, relatively inexpensive and carries   a reduced short-term risk for the patient compared with the alternative   of removing well-fixed cement. We report the outcomes of this procedure   when two commonly used femoral stems are used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 1179 cement-in-cement stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions involving   an Exeter or a Lubinus stem reported to the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register (SHAR) between January 1999 and December 2015.

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 fractures by performing a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 fracture, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of fracture. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-operation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 fractures and 167 B3 fractures. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 fractures, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-operation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 fractures, the treatment in 160 (95.8%) involved   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion. A total of 23 patients (14.4%) treated   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasty and two (28.6%) treated only with internal   fixation required re-operation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A significant proportion, particularly of B2 fractures, were   treated without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of the stem. These were associated with   a higher rate of re-operation. The treatment of B3 fractures without   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of the stem resulted in a high rate of re-operation. This   demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation and accurate characterisation   of the fracture at the time of presentation to ensure the correct   management. There is a need for improvement in the reporting of   data in case series recording the outcome of the surgical treatment   of periprosthetic fractures.

Proximal femoral replacement in contemporary revision total hip arthroplasty for severe femoral bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Loss or absence of proximal femoral bone in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion total hip   arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant challenge. While the main   indication for the use of proximal femoral replacements (PFRs) is   in the treatment of malignant disease, they have a valuable role   in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA for loosening, fracture and infection in patients   with bone loss. Our aim was to determine the clinical outcomes,   implant survivorship, and complications of PFRs used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   THA for indications other than malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review of 44 patients who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   THA using a PFR between 2000 and 2013 was undertaken. Their mean   age was 79 years (53 to 97); 31 (70%) were women. The bone loss   was classified as Paprosky IIIB or IV in all patients. The mean   follow-up was six years (2 to 12), at which time 22 patients had   died and five were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 42.8 (25.9 to 82.9) pre-operatively   to 68.5 (21.0 to 87.7) post-operatively (p = 0.0009). A total of   two PFRs had been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ed, one for periprosthetic infection eight   years post-operatively and one for aseptic loosening six years post-operatively.   The Kaplan-Meier survivorship free of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion or removal of   an implant was 86% at five years and 66% years at ten years. A total   of 12 patients (27%) had a complication including six with a dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PFRs provide a useful salvage option for patients, particularly   the elderly with massive proximal femoral bone loss who require   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA, with significant clinical improvement.

Impact of a learning curve on the survivorship of 4802 cementless total hip arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to report survivorship data and lessons learned with   the Corail/Pinnacle cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) system.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between August 2005 and March 2015, a total of 4802 primary cementless   Corail/Pinnacle THAs were performed in 4309 patients. In March 2016,   we reviewed these hips from a prospectively maintained database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>A total of 80 hips (1.67%) have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ed which is equivalent   to a cumulative risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of 2.5% at ten years. The rate   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion was not significantly higher in patients aged ≥ 70 years   (p = 0.93). The leading indications for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion were instability   (n = 22, 0.46%), infection (n = 20, 0.42%), aseptic femoral loosening   (n = 15, 0.31%) and femoral fracture (n = 6, 0.12%). There were   changes in the surgical technique with respect to the Corail femoral component   during the ten-year period involving a change to collared components   and a trend towards larger size. These resulted in a decrease in   the rate of iatrogenic femoral fracture and a decrease in the rate   of aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion in this series is comparable with the best   performing THAs in registry data. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions were not directly   related to the implants. Despite extensive previous experience with   cemented femoral components, the senior author noted a learning   curve requiring increased focus on primary stability. The number   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions related to the femoral component is reducing.</p><p>Any new technology has a learning curve that may be independent   of surgical experience.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1589–96.</p></sec>

Is the rate of revision of 36 mm metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasties with Pinnacle acetabular components related to the year of the initial operation?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether the rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   for metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasties (THAs) with Pinnacle   components varied according to the year of the initial operation,   and compare these with the rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion for other designs of   MoM THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data from the National Joint Registry for England and Wales included   36 mm MoM THAs with Pinnacle acetabular components which were undertaken   between 2003 and 2012 with follow-up for at least five years (n   = 10 776) and a control group of other MoM THAs (n = 13 817). The   effect of the year of the primary operation on all-cause rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   was assessed using Cox regression and interrupted time-series analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For MoM THAs involving Pinnacle components, those undertaken   between 2007 and 2012 had higher rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion compared with   those undertaken between 2004 and 2006 (hazard ratio (HR) 2.01;   95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57 to 2.57; p < 0.001). For THAs   undertaken during and after 2007, the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions per 1000   implant-years at risk significantly increased by 5.20 (95% CI 0.52   to 9.89; p = 0.033) compared with those undertaken before this time.</p><p>In the control group, THAs undertaken between 2007 and 2012 also   had higher rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.49 to 2.10; p <   0.001), with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions per 1000 implant-years for those undertaken   during and after 2007 significantly increasing by 6.13 (95% CI 1.42   to 10.83; p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The five-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion rates were significantly increased for   all primary MoM THAs undertaken from 2007 onwards.

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty using dual mobility acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this systematic review was to report the rate of dislocation   following the use of dual mobility (DM) acetabular components in   primary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines   was performed. A comprehensive search of Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane   Library and Embase (Scopus) was conducted for English articles between   January 1974 and March 2016 using various combinations of the keywords “dual   mobility”, “dual-mobility”, “tripolar”, “double-mobility”, “double   mobility”, “hip”, “cup”, “socket”. The following data were extracted   by two investigators independently: demographics, whether the operation   was a primary or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA, length of follow-up, the design of   the components, diameter of the femoral head, and type of fixation   of the acetabular component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 59 articles met our inclusion criteria. These included   a total of 17 908 THAs which were divided into two groups: studies   dealing with DM components in primary THA and those dealing with   these components in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA. The mean rate of dislocation was   0.9% in the primary THA group, and 3.0% in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA group.   The mean rate of intraprosthetic dislocation was 0.7% in primary   and 1.3% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the current data, the use of DM acetabular components   are effective in minimising the risk of instability after both primary   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA. This benefit must be balanced against continuing   concerns about the additional modularity, and the new mode of failure   of intraprosthetic dislocation.

Femoral impaction bone grafting in revision hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral impaction bone grafting was first developed in 1987 using   morselised cancellous bone graft impacted into the femoral canal   in combination with a cemented, tapered, polished stem.

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions for bearing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing fractures   to date. The risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion for CoC bearing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head fracture but not of liner fracture. Small head   size and high patient BMI are associated with an increased risk   of ceramic bearing fracture.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1012–19.</p></sec>

The long-term clinical and radiological outcomes in patients who suffer recurrent injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament after reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical   and radiological outcome of patients who suffer recurrent injuries   to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after reconstruction and   require <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From a consecutive series of 200 patients who underwent primary   reconstruction following rupture of the ACL, we identified 36 who   sustained a further rupture, 29 of whom underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery.   Patients were reviewed prospectively at one, two, seven, 15 and   about 20 years after their original surgery.

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of impaction   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. Impaction bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   defects. The precepts of modern, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion impaction grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary defects must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously impacted morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic cement is used to stabilise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ed   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique. While   having its limitations, it is a viable option to address large acetabular   defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):25–30.</p>

Do higher-volume hospitals provide better value in revision hip and knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study is to determine if higher volume hospitals   have lower costs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion hip and knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We questioned the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services   (CMS) Inpatient Charge Data and identified 789 hospitals performing   a total of 29 580 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasties in 2014. Centres were   dichotomised into high-volume (performing over 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion cases   per year) and low-volume. Mean total hospital-specific charges and   inpatient payments were obtained from the database and stratified   based on Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes.

While high-volume hospitals had   higher Medicare inpatient payments for DRG 467 ($21 458 <i>versus</i> $20 632,   p = 0.038) and DRG 468 ($17 003 <i>versus</i> $16 120,   p = 0.011), there was no difference in hospital specific charges   between the groups.

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Positive cultures are not uncommon in cases of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion total   knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA and THA) for presumed aseptic causes.   The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of positive   intra-operative cultures in presumed aseptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of TKA and   THA, and to determine whether the presence of intra-operative positive cultures   results in inferior survival in such cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective cohort study was assembled with 679 patients   undergoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion knee (340 cases) or hip arthroplasty (339 cases)   for presumed aseptic causes.

The analysis of synovial fluid in total knee arthroplasties with flexion instability
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with flexion instability after total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) often present with a recurrent effusion, which may be a haemarthrosis.   While the radiographic factors contributing to flexion instability   have been elucidated, the clinical diagnosis remains challenging.   Our aim, in this study, was to determine the mean white cell count   and differential profile in pre-operative aspirations of synovial   fluid in a consecutive series of patients undergoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion TKA   for flexion instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2000 and 2010, 60 patients undergoing aseptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   TKA for flexion instability were identified. The results of the   pre-operative aspiration of synovial fluid were available for 53   patients (88%). These patients were 1:2 matched to 106 patients   who underwent aseptic TKA for indications other than flexion instability.   The mean age of the patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion TKA was 65 years (44 to   82) and 55% were women. The mean follow-up was 4.3 years (2 to 10.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the flexion instability group, the median total cell count   was 312 cells/µL (interquartile range (IQR) 104 to 624), with a   mean distribution of 45% macrophages (2% to 90%), 30% lymphocytes   (1% to 69%), 18% neutrophils (0% to 80%), 0.5% eosinophils (0% to   6%) and 7% other cells (0% to 42%; mainly synovial cells). There   was no significant difference in the median total cell count (p   = 0.14) or mean distribution of macrophages (p = 0.42), lymphocytes   (p = 0.38), neutrophils (p = 0.19) and eosinophils (p = 0.89) between   the flexion instability and control groups.

Kudo type-5 total elbow arthroplasty for patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We assessed the long-term (more than ten-year) outcomes of the   Kudo type-5 elbow prosthesis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis   (RA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 41 elbows (Larsen Grade IV, n = 21; Grade V, n =   20) in 31 patients with RA who had undergone a Kudo type-5 total   elbow arthroplasty (TEA) between 1994 and 2003, and had been followed   up for more than ten years. The humeral component was cementless   and the all-polyethylene ulnar component cemented in every patient. Clinical   outcome was assessed using the Mayo elbow performance score. We   calculated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion rate and evaluated potential risk factors   for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion. The duration of follow-up was a mean 141 months (120   to 203).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Aseptic loosening of the ulnar component occurred in 11 elbows.   There was no radiolucency around any humeral component. There was   one deep infection. The survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier   survivorship analysis was 87.8% after five years and 70.7% after   ten years. The range of extension/flexion was a mean -38° (-80°   to 0°)/105° (30° to 150°) before surgery and -40° (-70° to -20°)/132°   (100° to 150°) at the final follow-up, while the mean Mayo elbow performance   score was 43 before surgery and 80 at final follow-up. Disease duration   of RA up to the TEA of < 15 years and a pre-operative range of   movement (ROM) of > 85° were significant risk factors for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   or aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although Kudo type-5 prostheses gave satisfactory results in   the short-term, aseptic loosening increased after five years. In   most cases, elbow function was maintained in the long-term without   loosening of the implant.

Proximal translation of > 1 mm within the first two years of revision total hip arthroplasty correctly predicts whether or not an acetabular component is loose in 80% of cases
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity   and predictive values of previously reported thresholds of proximal   translation and sagittal rotation of cementless acetabular components   used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion total hip arthroplasty (THA) at various times   during early follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Migration of cementless acetabular components was measured retrospectively   in 84 patients (94 components) using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup)   in two groups of patients. In Group A, components were recorded   as not being loose intra-operatively at re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion THA (52 components/48   patients) and Group B components were recorded to be loose at re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   (42 components/36 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean proximal translation and sagittal rotation were significantly   higher in Group B than in Group A from three months onwards (p <   0.02). Proximal translation > 1.0 mm within 24 months had a positive   predictive value (PPV) of 90% and a specificity of 94%, but a sensitivity   of 64%. Proximal translation > 1.0 mm within the first 24 months correctly   identified 76 of 94 (81%) of components to be either loose or not   loose.

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery. This laboratory   study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic antibacterial   properties against planktonic bacteria, or the ability to inhibit   biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components   were sterilised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either <i>Staphylococcus   (S.) aureus</i> or <i>S. epidermidis</i> for 24 hours.   After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified   on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. In order to establish whether biofilms   formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these   Ta and Ti pieces were then washed twice, sonicated and washed again   to remove loosely adhered planktonic bacteria. They were then re-incubated   for 24 hours prior to quantifying the number of cfu.

The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with exchangeable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer surgeons an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   reported an increased rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion after primary THA using femoral   stems with an exchangeable neck.

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless hemispherical acetabular components and metal   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a reconstruction cage and a porous   metal augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a reconstruction cage and porous metal augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the mean follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The mean number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3). All patients had segmental defects   involving more than 50% of the acetabulum and seven hips had an   associated pelvic discontinuity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three failures were observed in two hips, both of which had undergone   a previous resection of a tumour affecting the acetabulum. Other   complications included a late arterial injury, a sciatic nerve palsy,   a dislocation treated with a femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion, a deep infection   treated with irrigation and debridement and a fracture of the greater   trochanter treated conservatively. The mean Oxford Hip Score significantly   increased from 13.9 (2 to 23) to 28.7 (13 to 38) (p < 0.00001).   The mean vertical distance between the centre of rotation of the   hip and its normal location decreased from 30 mm to 10 mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acceptable early survivorship can be achieved using this novel   technique, but it may be unsuitable for use in patients who have   previously undergone the resection of a tumour involving the acetabulum.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:607–13.</p></sec>

The Targon Femoral Neck hip screw <i>versus</i> cannulated screws for internal fixation of intracapsular fractures of the hip
<p>We compared a new fixation system, the Targon   Femoral Neck (TFN) hip screw, with the current standard treatment of   cannulated screw fixation. This was a single-centre, participant-blinded,   randomised controlled trial. Patients aged 65 years and over with   either a displaced or undisplaced intracapsular fracture of the   hip were eligible. The primary outcome was the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion   surgery within one year of fixation.</p><p>A total of 174 participants were included in the trial. The absolute   reduction in risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion was of 4.7% (95% CI 14.2 to 22.5)   in favour of the TFN hip screw (chi-squared test, p = 0.741), which   was less than the pre-specified level of minimum clinically important   difference.

The medium- and long-term outcome of total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis in middle-aged patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Promising medium-term results from total shoulder arthroplasty   (TSA) have been reported for the treatment of primary osteoarthritis   in young and middle-aged patients. The aim of this study was to   evaluate the long-term functional and radiological outcome of TSA   in the middle-aged patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The data of all patients from the previous medium-term study   were available. At a mean follow-up of 13 years (8 to 17), we reviewed   21 patients (12 men, nine women, 21 shoulders) with a mean age of   55 years (37 to 60). The Constant-Murley score (CS) with its subgroups   and subjective satisfaction were measured.

Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta ceramic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of ceramic fracture, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   cementless THA using a delta ceramic femoral head and liner. At   each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded.   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable wear, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ed because of   fracture of the ceramic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the ceramic liner at the time of surgery.

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented components have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased operating time and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the time   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion of a cemented humeral component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001).

Risk factors for failure of the 36 mm metal-on-metal Pinnacle total hip arthroplasty system
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine ten-year failure rates following 36 mm metal-on-metal   (MoM) Pinnacle total hip arthroplasty (THA), and identify predictors   of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively assessed a single-centre cohort of 569 primary   36 mm MoM Pinnacle THAs (all Corail stems) followed up since 2012   according to Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulation Agency   recommendations. All-cause failure rates (all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion, and   non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ed cross-sectional imaging failures) were calculated, with predictors   for failure identified using multivariable Cox regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Failure occurred in 97 hips (17.0%). The ten-year cumulative   failure rate was 27.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.6 to 33.7).   Primary implantation from 2006 onwards (hazard ratio (HR) 4.30;   95% CI 1.82 to 10.1; p = 0.001) and bilateral MoM hip arthroplasty   (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.46; p = 0.037) predicted failure. The   effect of implantation year on failure varied over time. From four   years onwards following surgery, hips implanted since 2006 had significantly higher   failure rates (eight years 28.3%; 95% CI 23.1 to 34.5) compared   with hips implanted before 2006 (eight years 6.3%; 95% CI 2.4 to   15.8) (HR 15.2; 95% CI 2.11 to 110.4; p = 0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We observed that 36 mm MoM Pinnacle THAs have an unacceptably   high ten-year failure rate, especially if implanted from 2006 onwards   or in bilateral MoM hip patients. Our findings regarding implantation   year and failure support recent concerns about the device manufacturing   process. We recommend all patients undergoing implantation since   2006 and those with bilateral MoM hips undergo regular investigation,   regardless of symptoms.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:592–600.</p></sec>

Qualitative α-defensin test (Synovasure) for the diagnosis of periprosthetic infection in revision total joint arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains   demanding due to limitations of all the available diagnostic tests.   The synovial fluid marker, α-defensin, is a promising adjunct for   the assessment of potential PJI. The purpose of this study was to   investigate the qualitative assessment of α-defensin, using Synovasure   to detect or exclude periprosthetic infection in total joint arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We studied 50 patients (28 women, 22 men, mean age 65 years;   20 to 89) with a clinical indication for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasty who   met the inclusion criteria of this prospective diagnostic study.   The presence of α-defensin was determined using the qualitative   Synovasure test and compared with standard diagnostic methods for   PJI. Based on modified Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS)   criteria, 13 cases were categorised as septic and 36 as aseptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ions.   One test was inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Synovasure test achieved a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity   of 94%. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 12.46 and   0.33, respectively. A good diagnostic accuracy for PJI, with an   area under the curve of 0.82, was demonstrated. Adjusted p-values   using the method of Hochberg showed that Synovasure is as good at diagnosing   PJI as histology (p = 0.0042) and bacteriology with one positive   culture (p = 0.0327).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With its ease of use and rapid results after approximately ten   minutes, Synovasure may be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of   PJI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:66–72.</p></sec>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a mean of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of bone are required in the surgical   management of tumours, and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

A positive bacterial culture during re-implantation is associated with a poor outcome in two-stage exchange arthroplasty for deep infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of positive   cultures during the second stage of a two-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasty   and to analyse the association between positive cultures and an   infection-free outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This single-centre retrospective review of prospectively collected   data included patients with a periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   of either the hip or the knee between 2013 and 2015, who were treated   using a standardised diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm with two-stage   exchange. Failure of treatment was assessed according to a definition   determined by a Delphi-based consensus. Logistic regression analysis   was performed to assess the predictors of positive culture and risk   factors for failure. The mean follow-up was 33 months (24 to 48).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 163 two-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion arthroplasties involving 84   total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and 79 total knee arthroplasties   (TKAs) were reviewed. In 27 patients (16.6%), ≥ 1 positive culture   was identified at re-implantation and eight (29.6%) of these subsequently   failed compared with 20 (14.7%) patients who were culture-negative.   The same initially infecting organism was isolated at re-implantation   in nine of 27 patients (33.3%). The organism causing re-infection   in none of the patients was the same as that isolated at re-implantation.   The risk of the failure of treatment was significantly higher in   patients with a positive culture (odds ratio (OR) 1.7; 95% confidence   interval (CI) 1.0 to 3.0; p = 0.049) and in patients with a higher   Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.6 to 1.8; p = 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Positive culture at re-implantation was independently associated   with subsequent failure. Surgeons need to be aware of this association   and should consider the medical optimisation of patients with severe   comorbidities both before and during treatment.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1490–5.</p></sec>

Accuracy of CT-navigated pedicle screw positioning in the cervical and upper thoracic region with and without prior anterior surgery and ventral plating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to retrospectively assess the accuracy and safety of   CT navigated pedicle screws and to compare accuracy in the cervical   and thoracic spine (C2-T8) with (COMB) and without (POST) prior   anterior surgery (anterior cervical discectomy or corpectomy and   fusion with ventral plating: ACDF/ACCF).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 592 pedicle screws, which were used in 107 consecutively   operated patients (210 COMB, 382 POST), were analysed. The accuracy   of positioning was determined according to the classification of   Gertzbein and Robbins on post-operative CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High accuracy was achieved in 524 screws (88.5%), 192 (87.7%)   in the cervical spine and 332 (89%) in the thoracic spine, respectively.   The results in the two surgical groups were compared and a logistic   regression mixed model was performed to analyse the risk of low   accuracy. Significantly lower accuracy was found in the COMB group   with 82.9% <i>versus</i> 91.6% in the POST group (p =   0.036). There were no neurological complications, but two vertebral artery   lesions were recorded. Three patients underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion surgery   for malpositioning of a screw. Although the risk of malpositioning   of a screw after primary anterior surgery was estimated to be 2.4-times   higher than with posterior surgery alone, the overall rates of complication   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion were low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We therefore conclude that CT navigated pedicle screws can be   positioned safely although greater caution must be taken in patients   who have previously undergone anterior surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1373–80.</p></sec>

Predicting dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 55 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is higher   in patients under 55 years, but little data are reported regarding   non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revis</span></strong>ion outcomes. This study aims to identify predictors of   dissatisfaction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 177 TKAs (157 consecutive patients,   99 women, mean age 50 years; 17 to 54) from 2008 to 2013. Age, gender,   implant, indication, body mass index (BMI), social deprivation,   range of movement, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of osteoarthritis   (OA) and prior knee surgery were recorded. Pre- and post-operative   Oxford Knee Score (OKS) as well as Short Form-12 physical (PCS)   and mental component scores were obtained. Post-operative range   of movement, complications and satisfaction were measured at one   year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>Overall, 44 patients with 44 TKAs (24.9%) under 55 years of age   were unsure or dissatisfied with their knee. Significant predictors   of dissatisfaction on univariate analysis included: KL grade 1/2   OA (59% dissatisfied), poor pre-operative OKS, complications, poor   improvements in PCS and OKS and indication (primary OA 19% dissatisfied,   previous meniscectomy 41%, multiply operated 42%, other surgery   29%, BMI > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> 31%, post-traumatic OA 45%, and inflammatory   arthropathy 5%). Poor pre-operative OKS, poor improvement in OKS   and post-operative stiffness independently predicted dissatisfaction   on multivariate analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients receiving TKA younger than 55 years old should be informed   about the increased risks of dissatisfaction.

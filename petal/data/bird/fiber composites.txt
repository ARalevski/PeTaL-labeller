A valley valve and electron beam splitter
<p>Developing alternative paradigms of electronics beyond silicon technology requires the exploration of fundamentally new physical mechanisms, such as the valley-specific phenomena in hexagonal two-dimensional materials. We realize ballistic valley Hall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> states in bilayer graphene and demonstrate gate-controlled current transmission in a four-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> router device. The operations of a waveguide, a valve, and a tunable electron beam splitter are demonstrated. The valley valve exploits the valley-momentum locking of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> states and reaches an on/off ratio of 8 at zero magnetic field. A magnetic field enables a full-range tunable coherent beam splitter. These results pave a path to building a scalable, coherent quantum transportation network based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> states.</p>

Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks
<p>Subcellular membraneless assemblies are a reinvigorated area of study in biology, with spirited scientific discussions on the forces between the low-complexity protein domains within these assemblies. To illuminate these forces, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless assemblies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong>ed β sheets that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong>ed sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong>ed structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless assemblies.</p>

High-quality graphene via microwave reduction of solution-exfoliated graphene oxide
<p>Efficient exfoliation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e in solutions to obtain high-quality graphene flakes is desirable for printable electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and composites. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions.</p>

Chemical Inhibition of NAT10 Corrects Defects of Laminopathic Cells
<sec><title>Remodelin Nuclear Defects</title><p>Deregulation of A-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong> proteins leads to disorganization of chromatin structure and misshapen nuclei, which are believed to underlie the pathologies of various human diseases, including the premature aging disorder Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and various cancers. <bold>Larrieu <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 527) developed a small molecule, Remodelin, that not only improved nuclear shape defects of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong> A/C–depleted cells, HGPS cells, and aged normal cells, but also decreased the levels of a DNA damage marker and improved global cellular fitness.</p></sec>

Observation of second sound in graphite at temperatures above 100 K
<p>Wavelike thermal transport in solids, referred to as second sound, is an exotic phenomenon previously limited to a handful of materials at low temperatures. The rare occurrence of this effect restricted its scientific and practical importance. We directly observed second sound in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e at temperatures above 100 kelvins by using time-resolved optical measurements of thermal transport on the micrometer-length scale. Our experimental results are in qualitative agreement with ab initio calculations that predict wavelike phonon hydrodynamics. We believe that these results potentially indicate an important role of second sound in microscale transient heat transport in two-dimensional and layered materials in a wide temperature range.</p>

Structure and dynamics of the active human parathyroid hormone receptor-1
<p>The parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTH1R) is a class B G protein–coupled receptor central to calcium homeostasis and a therapeutic target for osteoporosis and hypoparathyroidism. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of human PTH1R bound to a long-acting PTH analog and the stimulatory G protein. The bound peptide adopts an extended helix with its amino terminus inserted deeply into the receptor transmembrane domain (TMD), which leads to partial unwinding of the carboxyl terminus of transmembrane helix 6 and induces a sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> at the middle of this helix to allow the receptor to couple with G protein. In contrast to a single TMD structure state, the extracellular domain adopts multiple conformations. These results provide insights into the structural basis and dynamics of PTH binding and receptor activation.</p>

Finite phenine nanotubes with periodic vacancy defects
<p>Discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>ic carbon compounds serve as tunable models for the properties of extended macromolecular structures such as nanotubes. Here, we report synthesis and characterization of a cylindrical C<sub>304</sub>H<sub>264</sub> molecule composed of 40 benzene (phenine) units mutually bonded at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. The concise nine-step synthesis featuring successive borylations and couplings proceeded with an average yield for each benzene-benzene bond formation of 91%. The molecular structure of the nanometer-sized cylinder with periodic vacancy defects was confirmed spectroscopically and crystallographically. The nanoporous nature of the compound further enabled inclusion of multiple fullerene guests. Computations suggest that fusing many such cylinders could produce carbon nanotubes with electronic properties modulated by the periodic vacancy defects.</p>

High thermal conductivity in cubic boron arsenide crystals
<p>The high density of heat generated in power electronics and optoelectronic devices is a critical bottleneck in their application. New materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to effectively dissipate heat and thereby enable enhanced performance of power controls, solid-state lighting, communication, and security systems. We report the experimental discovery of high thermal conductivity at room temperature in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) grown through a modified chemical vapor transport technique. The thermal conductivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e. This work shows that BAs represents a class of ultrahigh–thermal conductivity materials predicted by a recent theory, and that it may constitute a useful thermal management material for high–power density electronic devices.</p>

Nitrogen fixation and reduction at boron
<p>Currently, the only compounds known to support fixation and functionalization of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) under nonmatrix conditions are based on metals. Here we present the observation of N<sub>2</sub> binding and reduction by a nonmetal, specifically a dicoordinate borylene. Depending on the reaction conditions under which potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e is introduced as a reductant, N<sub>2</sub> binding to two borylene units results in either neutral (B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) or dianionic ([B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2–</sup>) products that can be interconverted by respective exposure to further reductant or to air. The <sup>15</sup>N isotopologues of the neutral and dianionic molecules were prepared with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled dinitrogen, allowing observation of the nitrogen nuclei by <sup>15</sup>N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Protonation of the dianionic compound with distilled water furnishes a diradical product with a central hydrazido B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> unit. All three products were characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically.</p>

Atomic structure of sensitive battery materials and interfaces revealed by cryo–electron microscopy
<p>Whereas standard transmission electron microscopy studies are unable to preserve the native state of chemically reactive and beam-sensitive battery materials after operation, such materials remain pristine at cryogenic conditions. It is then possible to atomically resolve individual lithium metal atoms and their interface with the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). We observe that dendrites in carbonate-based electrolytes grow along the <111> (preferred), <110>, or <211> directions as faceted, single-crystalline nanowires. These growth directions can change at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong>s with no observable crystallographic defect. Furthermore, we reveal distinct SEI nanostructures formed in different electrolytes.</p>

MOF-derived cobalt nanoparticles catalyze a general synthesis of amines
<p>The development of base metal catalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds remains an important goal of chemical research. Here, we report that cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>ic shell are broadly effective reductive amination catalysts. Their convenient and practical preparation entailed template assembly of cobalt-diamine-dicarboxylic acid metal organic frameworks on carbon and subsequent pyrolysis under inert atmosphere. The resulting stable and reusable catalysts were active for synthesis of primary, secondary, tertiary, and <i>N</i>-methy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>es (more than 140 examples). The reaction couples easily accessible carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) with ammonia, amines, or nitro compounds, and molecular hydrogen under industrially viable and scalable conditions, offering cost-effective access to numerous amines, amino acid derivatives, and more complex drug targets.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels
<p>Fatigue failures create enormous risks for all engineered structures, as well as for human lives, motivating large safety factors in design and, thus, inefficient use of resources. Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue resistance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel microstructures are hierarchical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response. The exceptional properties enabled by this strategy provide guidance for all fatigue-resistant alloy design efforts.</p>

Xist recruits the X chromosome to the nuclear lamina to enable chromosome-wide silencing
<p>The Xist long noncoding RNA orchestrates X chromosome inactivation, a process that entails chromosome-wide silencing and remodeling of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the X chromosome. Yet, it remains unclear whether these changes in nuclear structure are mediated by Xist and whether they are required for silencing. Here, we show that Xist directly interacts with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong> B receptor, an integral component of the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>a, and that this interaction is required for Xist-mediated silencing by recruiting the inactive X to the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>a and by doing so enables Xist to spread to actively transcribed genes across the X. Our results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>a recruitment changes the 3D structure of DNA, enabling Xist and its silencing proteins to spread across the X to silence transcription.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Impact of Novel Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol Assessment on the Utility of Secondary Non-High-Density Lipoprotein-C and Apolipoprotein B Targets in Selected Worldwide Dyslipidemia Guidelines
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Selected dyslipidemia guidelines recommend non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) as secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s to the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). After considering 2 LDL-C estimates that differ in accuracy, we examined: (1) how frequently non-HDL-C guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s could change management; and (2) the utility of apoB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s after meeting LDL-C and non-HDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed 2518 adults representative of the US population from the 2011 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 126 092 patients from the Very Large Database of Lipids study with apoB. We identified all individuals as well as those with high-risk clinical features, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome who met very high- and high-risk guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL using Friedewald estimation (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) and a novel, more accurate method (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>). Next, we examined those not meeting non-HDL-C (<100, <130 mg/dL) and apoB (<80, <100 mg/dL) guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s. In those meeting dual LDL-C and non-HDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s (<70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively, or <100 and <130 mg/dL, respectively), we determined the proportion of individuals who did not meet guideline apoB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s (<80 or <100 mg/dL).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7% to 9% and 31% to 36% of individuals had LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively.

Among those with LDL-C<sub>F</sub><100 mg/dL, 8% to 10% had non-HDL-C ≥130 mg/dL and 2% to 3% had apoB ≥100 mg/dL. In comparison, among those with LDL-C<sub>N</sub><70 or 100 mg/dL, only ≈2% and ≈1% of individuals, respectively, had non-HDL-C and apoB values above guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s.

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> group versus 55.7% in the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> group (<i>P</i>=0.76).

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient tool for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genome editing. In this study, we showed successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genomic sequence on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genomic sequences without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> any sequence adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing sequences were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible tool for genome editing in medaka.</p>

Unbiased detection of CRISPR off-targets in vivo using DISCOVER-Seq
<p>CRISPR-Cas genome editing induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed DNA damage but can also affect off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sites. Current off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> discovery methods work using purified DNA or specific cellular models but are incapable of direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion in vivo. We developed DISCOVER-Seq (discovery of in situ Cas off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s and verification by sequencing), a universally applicable approach for unbiased off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> identification that leverages the recruitment of DNA repair factors in cells and organisms. Tracking the precise recruitment of MRE11 uncovers the molecular nature of Cas activity in cells with single-base resolution. DISCOVER-Seq works with multiple guide RNA formats and types of Cas enzymes, allowing characterization of new editing tools. Off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s can be identified in cell lines and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and during adenoviral editing of mice, paving the way for in situ off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> discovery within individual patient genotypes during therapeutic genome editing.</p>

Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2
<p>Rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive nucleic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion may aid point-of-care pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion, genotyping, and disease monitoring. The RNA-guided, RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) exhibits a “collateral effect” of promiscuous ribonuclease activity upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. We combine the collateral effect of Cas13a with isothermal amplification to establish a CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx), providing rapid DNA or RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion with attomolar sensitivity and single-base mismatch specificity. We use this Cas13a-based molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion platform, termed Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK), to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> specific strains of Zika and Dengue virus, distinguish pathogenic bacteria, genotype human DNA, and identify mutations in cell-free tumor DNA. Furthermore, SHERLOCK reaction reagents can be lyophilized for cold-chain independence and long-term storage and be readily reconstituted on paper for field applications.</p>

Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease with expanded targeting space
<p>The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 cleaves its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> DNA and is a powerful genome-editing tool. However, the widely used <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9 enzyme (SpCas9) requires an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion, thereby restricting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>able genomic loci. Here, we report a rationally engineered SpCas9 variant (SpCas9-NG) that can recognize relaxed NG PAMs. The crystal structure revealed that the loss of the base-specific interaction with the third nucleobase is compensated by newly introduced non–base-specific interactions, thereby enabling the NG PAM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. We showed that SpCas9-NG induces indels at endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sites bearing NG PAMs in human cells. Furthermore, we found that the fusion of SpCas9-NG and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates the C-to-T conversion at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sites with NG PAMs in human cells.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing peptide, are necessary for oleosin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

Quantitative assay for TALEN activity at endogenous genomic loci
<p>Artificially designed nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) can induce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed DNA double-strand break at the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genomic locus, leading to the frameshift-mediated gene disruption. However, the assays for their activity on the endogenous genomic loci remain limited. Herein, we describe a versatile modified <i>lacZ</i> assay to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> frameshifts in the nuclease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> site. Short fragments of the genome DNA at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> or putative off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> loci were amplified from the genomic DNA of TALEN-treated or control embryos, and were inserted into the <i>lacZα</i> sequence for the conventional blue–white selection. The frequency of the frameshifts in the fragment can be estimated from the numbers of blue and white colonies. Insertions and/or deletions were easily determined by sequencing the plasmid DNAs recovered from the positive colonies. Our technique should offer broad application to the artificial nucleases for genome editing in various types of model organisms.</p>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>-validated small-molecule compounds with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> of previously described small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule–induced protein down-regulation through drug “off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s” might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> pseudokinases.</p>

Cytosine base editor generates substantial off-target single-nucleotide variants in mouse embryos
<p>Genome editing holds promise for correcting pathogenic mutations. However, it is difficult to determine off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> effects of editing due to single-nucleotide polymorphism in individuals. Here we developed a method named GOTI (genome-wide off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> analysis by two-cell embryo injection) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> mutations by editing one blastomere of two-cell mouse embryos using either CRISPR-Cas9 or base editors. Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of progeny cells of edited and nonedited blastomeres at embryonic day 14.5 showed that off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were rare in embryos edited by CRISPR-Cas9 or adenine base editor, with a frequency close to the spontaneous mutation rate. By contrast, cytosine base editing induced SNVs at more than 20-fold higher frequencies, requiring a solution to address its fidelity.</p>

NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination
<p>Molecularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed therapies aim to obstruct cell autonomous programs required for tumor growth. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors act in combination to suppress the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells while simultaneously provoking a natural killer (NK) cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surveil</span></strong>lance program leading to tumor cell death. The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components tumor necrosis factor–α and intercellular adhesion molecule–1 are required for NK cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surveil</span></strong>lance of drug-treated tumor cells, which contributes to tumor regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse model. Therefore, molecularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed agents capable of inducing senescence can produce tumor control through non–cell autonomous mechanisms involving NK cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surveil</span></strong>lance.</p>

CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity
<p>CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided enzymes that bind and cut DNA as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed, double-stranded DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>-activated, nonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase activation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA endonuclease-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed CRISPR trans reporter (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>R), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>R enables rapid and specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion of human papillomavirus in patient samples, thereby providing a simple platform for molecular diagnostics.</p>

Defining the physiological role of SRP in protein-targeting efficiency and specificity
<p>The signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion particle (SRP) enables cotranslational delivery of proteins for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but its full in vivo role remains incompletely explored. We combined rapid auxin-induced SRP degradation with proximity-specific ribosome profiling to define SRP’s in vivo function in yeast. Despite the classic view that SRP recognizes amino-terminal signal sequences, we show that SRP was generally essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing transmembrane domains regardless of their position relative to the amino terminus. By contrast, many proteins containing cleavable amino-terminal signal peptides were efficiently cotranslationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed in SRP’s absence. We also reveal an unanticipated consequence of SRP loss: Transcripts normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed to the ER were mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed to mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial defects. These results elucidate SRP’s essential roles in maintaining the efficiency and specificity of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing.</p>

The piRNA targeting rules and the resistance to piRNA silencing in endogenous genes
<p>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons to safeguard genome integrity in animals. However, the functions of the many piRNAs that do not map to transposons remain unknown. Here, we show that piRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can tolerate a few mismatches but prefer perfect pairing at the seed region. The broad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing capacity of piRNAs underlies the germline silencing of transgenes in <i>C. elegans</i>. Transgenes engineered to avoid piRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion are stably expressed. Many endogenous germline-expressed genes also contain predicted piRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing sites, and periodic An/Tn clusters (PATCs) are an intrinsic signal that provides resistance to piRNA silencing. Together, our study revealed the piRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing rules and highlights a distinct strategy that <i>C. elegans</i> uses to distinguish endogenous from foreign nucleic acids.</p>

Antagonistic Actions of FPA and IBM2 Regulate Transcript Processing from Genes Containing Heterochromatin
<p>Repressive epigenetic marks, such as DNA and histone methylation, are sometimes located within introns. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION2 (IBM2), an RNA-binding protein containing a bromo-adjacent homology domain, is required to process functional transcript isoforms of genes carrying intronic heterochromatin. In a genetic screen for suppressors of the <i>ibm2</i> mutation, we identified FPA, an RNA-binding protein that promotes use of proximal polyadenylation sites in genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed by IBM2, including <i>IBM1</i> encoding an essential H3K9 histone demethylase and the disease resistance gene <i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA7</i>. Both IBM2 and FPA are involved in the processing of their common mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s: Transcription of IBM2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes is restored when <i>FPA</i> is mutated in <i>ibm2</i> and impaired in transgenic plants overexpressing <i>FPA</i>. By contrast, transposons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed by IBM2 and localized outside introns are not under this antagonistic control. The DNA methylation patterns of some genes and transposons are modified in <i>fpa</i> plants, including the large intron of <i>IBM1</i>, but these changes are rather limited and reversed when the mutant is complemented, indicating that FPA has a restricted role in mediating silencing. These data reveal a complex regulation by IBM2 and FPA pathways in processing mRNAs of genes bearing heterochromatic marks.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-binding sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> complementarity, nor miRNA binding site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 binding site. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

CRISPR-Cas9 Targeted Mutagenesis Leads to Simultaneous Modification of Different Homoeologous Gene Copies in Polyploid Oilseed Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>)
<p>In polyploid species, altering a trait by random mutagenesis is highly inefficient due to gene redundancy. We have stably transformed tetraploid oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) with a CRISPR-Cas9 construct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing two <i>ALCATRAZ</i> (<i>ALC</i>) homoeologs. <i>ALC</i> is involved in valve margin development and, thus, contributes to seed shattering from mature fruits. Knocking out <i>ALC</i> would increase shatter resistance to avoid seed loss during mechanical harvest. We obtained a transgenic T1 plant with four <i>alc</i> mutant alleles by the use of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sequence. All mutations were stably inherited to the T2 progeny. The T2 generation was devoid of any wild-type alleles, proving that the underlying T1 was a nonchimeric double heterozygote. T-DNA and <i>ALC</i> loci were not linked, as indicated by random segregation in the T2 generation. Hence, we could select double mutants lacking the T-DNA already in the first offspring generation. However, whole-genome sequencing data revealed at least five independent insertions of vector backbone sequences. We did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> any off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> effects in two genome regions homologous to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sequence.

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es of balancing and positive selection are species-specific, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ation was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ation of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

Cross-species analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of MAPK-driven colorectal cancer identifies hallmarks of the human disease
<p>Effective treatment options for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited, survival rates are poor and this disease continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite being a highly heterogeneous disease, a large subset of individuals with sporadic CRC typically harbor relatively few established ‘driver’ lesions. Here, we describe a collection of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of sporadic CRC that combine lesions frequently altered in human patients, including well-characterized tumor suppressors and activators of MAPK signaling. Primary tumors from these models were profiled, and individual GEMM tumors segregated into groups based on their genotypes. Unique allelic and genotypic expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es were generated from these GEMMs and applied to clinically annotated human CRC patient samples. We provide evidence that a <i>Kras</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>e derived from these GEMMs is capable of distinguishing human tumors harboring <i>KRAS</i> mutation, and tracks with poor prognosis in two independent human patient cohorts. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of human CRC cell lines suggests that high expression of the GEMM <i>Kras</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>e correlates with sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed pathway inhibitors. Together, these findings implicate GEMMs as powerful preclinical tools with the capacity to recapitulate relevant human disease biology, and support the use of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es generated in these models to facilitate future drug discovery and validation efforts.</p>

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular diseases. Furthermore, normal and diseased human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac death, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac death. We calculated the risk estimates for main outcomes according to a fixed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher risk of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher risk at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the risk of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year. Risk of cardiac death was similar between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our meta-analysis of randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years demonstrated a higher risk of ST and of TLF in patients treated with BVS compared with EES.

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was functionally analyzed in human endothelial cells in vitro. Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was identified by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity. Selected miRs were modulated in combination with GATA2 to identify signaling pathways at the angiogenic cytokine level via proteome profiler and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Downstream miR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s were identified via bioinformatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> prediction and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro findings were translated to a mouse model of carotid injury in an endothelial <i>GATA2</i> knockout background. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of proangiogenic miR-126 was tested in the reendothelialization model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>GATA2 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in human umbilical vein endothelial cells identified a key role of GATA2 as master regulator of multiple endothelial functions via miRNA-dependent mechanisms. Global miRNAnome-screening identified several GATA2-regulated miRNAs including miR-126 and miR-221. Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology. Hence, modulation of GATA2 and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s miR-126 and miR-221 is a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of many vascular diseases.</p></sec>

Protecting marine mammals, turtles, and birds by rebuilding global fisheries
<p>Reductions in global fishing pressure are needed to end overfishing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> species and maximize the value of fisheries. We ask whether such reductions would also be sufficient to protect non–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> species threatened as bycatch. We compare changes in fishing pressure needed to maximize profits from 4713 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> fish stocks—accounting for >75% of global catch—to changes in fishing pressure needed to reverse ongoing declines of 20 marine mammal, sea turtle, and seabird populations threatened as bycatch. We project that maximizing fishery profits would halt or reverse declines of approximately half of these threatened populations. Recovering the other populations would require substantially greater effort reductions or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing improvements. Improving commercial fishery management could thus yield important collateral benefits for threatened bycatch species globally.</p>

CancerSEEK tests were positive in a median of 70% of the eight cancer types.

Complexity in targeting membrane proteins
<p>For a cell, making hydrophobic integral membrane proteins (IMPs, or transmembrane proteins) is a complicated, but critical, process. All proteins are made by ribosomes in the cytosol, but IMPs, which account for ∼30% of the proteins encoded in the eukaryotic genome, must also be properly delivered to and inserted into their respective subcellular membranes, a process known as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing. This is important because hydrophobic IMPs are rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm to prevent aggregation, which can lead to broad disruptions in cellular homeostasis. Because of the number and diversity of IMPs, identifying and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing them relies on pathways that often overlap in function. The information for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing, typically stored in hydrophobic α-helical transmembrane domain (TMD) signals in the IMPs, is recognized by factors that then ferry the IMP client to the destined lipid bilayer. On page 470 of this issue, Guna <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) demonstrate that, for an essential class of IMPs, the current picture is incomplete. They identify a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing pathway for these IMPs, contributing to the elucidation of how the cell synthesizes this important class of proteins.</p>

The target landscape of clinical kinase drugs

Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed previously unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s for established drugs, offered a perspective on the “druggable” kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s, and suggested potential therapeutic applications.

We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD–positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource, available via the ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate basic, clinical, and drug discovery research and aid clinical decision-making.</p>

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p>Mutational processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a mutational footprint (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>e 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>e 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> mutations.</p>

Kinetics of dCas9 target search in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>How fast can a cell locate a specific chromosomal DNA sequence specified by a single-stranded oligonucleotide? To address this question, we investigate the intracellular search processes of the Cas9 protein, which can be programmed by a guide RNA to bind essentially any DNA sequence. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing flexibility requires Cas9 to unwind the DNA double helix to test for correct base pairing to the guide RNA. Here we study the search mechanisms of the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) in living <i>Escherichia coli</i> by combining single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and bulk restriction-protection assays. We find that it takes a single fluorescently labeled dCas9 6 hours to find the correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sequence, which implies that each potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> is bound for less than 30 milliseconds. Once bound, dCas9 remains associated until replication.

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing network more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the core face-processing network into a familiar face-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion system.</p>

Activity-dependent spatially localized miRNA maturation in neuronal dendrites
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation. In general, the number of potential mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s in a cell is much greater than the miRNA copy number, complicating high-fidelity miRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> interactions. We developed an inducible fluorescent probe to explore whether the maturation of a miRNA could be regulated in space and time in neurons. A precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) probe exhibited an activity-dependent increase in fluorescence, suggesting the stimulation of miRNA maturation. Single-synapse stimulation resulted in a local maturation of miRNA that was associated with a spatially restricted reduction in the protein synthesis of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> mRNA. Thus, the spatially and temporally regulated maturation of pre-miRNAs can be used to increase the precision and robustness of miRNA-mediated translational repression.</p>

The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the genetic and environmental conditioning of plant morphology are hindered by the lack of flexible and effective tools for quantifying morphology. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-homology-based topological methods can improve measurement of variation in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-homology-based methods can more comprehensively capture morphological variation; (2) these techniques <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discrimin</span></strong>ate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multivariate traits, whether statistically derived from univariate or persistent-homology-based traits, improve our ability to understand the genetic basis of phenotype; and (4) persistent-homology-based techniques <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multivariate derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of morphology are now <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>able. The QTL results further imply that genetic contributions to morphology can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural variation in tomato. Persistent homology is a versatile framework to quantify plant morphology and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

Decoys Untangle Complicated Redundancy and Reveal Targets of Circadian Clock F-Box Proteins
<p>Eukaryotic circadian clocks utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to precisely degrade clock proteins. In plants, the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1), and LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) regulate clock period and couple the clock to photoperiodic flowering in response to end-of-day light conditions. To better understand their functions, we expressed decoy ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 proteins that associate with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> proteins but are unable to ubiquitylate their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). These dominant-negative forms of the proteins inhibit the ubiquitylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> proteins and allow for the study of ubiquitylation-independent and -dependent functions of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. We demonstrate the effects of expressing ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 decoys on the circadian clock and flowering time. Furthermore, the decoy E3 ligases trap substrate interactions, and using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners. We focus studies on the clock transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) and show that ZTL interacts directly with CHE and can mediate CHE ubiquitylation. We also demonstrate that CHE protein is degraded in the dark and that degradation is reduced in a <i>ztl</i> mutant plant, showing that CHE is a bona fide ZTL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> protein. This work increases our understanding of the genetic and biochemical roles for ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 and also demonstrates an effective methodology for studying complicated genetic redundancy among E3 ubiquitin ligases.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified system allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ed to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>ing of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic stress. <i>T. HALOPHILA STRESS RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic stress resistance, especially in salt stress tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and retard the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes’ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> sequence of the promoter from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T. HALOPHILA H<sup>+</sup>-PPASE1</i>, and the transcription factors <i>MYB HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED</i> and <i>HOMEOBOX12</i>. In addition, TsNAC1 negatively regulates the expansion of cells, inhibits <i>LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS1</i> and <i>UDP-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE2</i>, and directly controls the expression of <i>MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA14</i>. Based on these results, we propose that TsNAC1 functions as an important upstream regulator of plant abiotic stress responses and vegetative growth.</p>

An Aphid Effector Targets Trafficking Protein VPS52 in a Host-Specific Manner to Promote Virulence
<p>Plant- and animal-feeding insects secrete saliva inside their hosts, containing effectors, which may promote nutrient release and suppress immunity. Although for plant pathogenic microbes it is well established that effectors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> host proteins to modulate host cell processes and promote disease, the host cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of herbivorous insects remain elusive. Here, we show that the existing plant pathogenic microbe effector paradigm can be extended to herbivorous insects in that effector-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong> interactions inside host cells modify critical host processes to promote plant susceptibility. We showed that the effector Mp1 from <i>Myzus persicae</i> associates with the host Vacuolar Protein Sorting Associated Protein52 (VPS52). Using natural variants, we provide a strong link between effector virulence activity and association with VPS52, and show that the association is highly specific to <i>M</i>. <i>persicae</i>-host interactions. Also, coexpression of Mp1, but not Mp1-like variants, specifically with host VPS52s resulted in effector relocalization to vesicle-like structures that associate with prevacuolar compartments. We show that high VPS52 levels negatively impact virulence, and that aphids are able to reduce VPS52 levels during infestation, indicating that VPS52 is an important virulence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>. Our work is an important step forward in understanding, at the molecular level, how a major agricultural pest promotes susceptibility during infestation of crop plants. We give evidence that an herbivorous insect employs effectors that interact with host proteins as part of an effective virulence strategy, and that these effectors likely function in a species-specific manner.</p>

Fast, Accurate and Automatic Ancient Nucleosome and Methylation Maps with epiPALEOMIX
<p>The first epigenomes from archaic hominins (AH) and ancient anatomically modern humans (AMH) have recently been characterized, based, however, on a limited number of samples. The extent to which ancient genome-wide epigenetic landscapes can be reconstructed thus remains contentious. Here, we present epiPALEOMIX, an open-source and user-friendly pipeline that exploits post-mortem DNA degradation patterns to reconstruct ancient methylomes and nucleosome maps from shotgun and/or capture-enrichment data. Applying epiPALEOMIX to the sequence data underlying 35 ancient genomes including AMH, AH, equids and aurochs, we investigate the temporal, geographical and preservation range of ancient epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es. We first assess the quality of inferred ancient epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es within well-characterized genomic regions. We find that tissue-specific methylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es can be obtained across a wider range of DNA preparation types than previously thought, including when no particular experimental procedures have been used to remove deaminated cytosines prior to sequencing. We identify a large subset of samples for which DNA associated with nucleosomes is protected from post-mortem degradation, and nucleosome positioning patterns can be reconstructed. Finally, we describe parameters and conditions such as DNA damage levels and sequencing depth that limit the preservation of epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signatur</span></strong>es in ancient samples. When such conditions are met, we propose that epigenetic profiles of CTCF binding regions can be used to help data authentication. Our work, including epiPALEOMIX, opens for further investigations of ancient epigenomes through time especially aimed at tracking possible epigenetic changes during major evolutionary, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural shifts.</p>

This suggests an important difference between primate and insect visual processing, so that while primates can capture entire visual scenes ‘at a glance’, insects might have to rely on continuous online sampling of the world around them, using a process of active vision, which requires longer integration times.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ing aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at revision THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">target</span></strong>s in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> compaction or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Under moderate and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 25 distal tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es.   Of the distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   than in distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are a variant of tarsometatarsal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart.

Role of En2 in the tectal laminar formation of chick embryos
<p>The chick optic tectum consists of 16 laminae. Here, we report contribution of En2 to laminar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in chick optic tecta. En2 is specifically expressed in laminae g-j of stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale (SGFS). Misexpression of En2 resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s (laminae a-f of SGFS), where endogenous En2 is not expressed. Misexpression of En2 before postmitotic cells had left the ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> indicated that En2-misexpressing cells stopped at the laminae of endogenous En2 expression and that they did not migrate into the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s. Induction of En2 misexpression using a tetracycline-inducible system after the postmitotic cells had reached superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s also resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s. Time-lapse analysis showed that En2-misexpressing cells migrated back from the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s towards the middle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s, where En2 is strongly expressed endogenously. Our results suggest a potential role of En2 in regulating cell migration and positioning in the tectal laminar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>m best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Tree Physiology
Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bed<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong> exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic carbon harbors three times as much carbon as Earth’s atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> depths increased with 4°C warming; annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming reveals a larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>) and models.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s during crater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>ed, shocked, felsic basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s. The peak-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in planetary crust.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>ation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of secondary cell walls and a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to investigate factors related to the technique of medial   opening wedge high tibial osteotomy which might predispose to the   development of a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 71 patients with 82 osteotomies were included in the   study. Their mean age was 62.9 years (37 to 80). The classification   of the type of osteotomy was based on whether it extended beyond   the fibular head.

A sufficient osteotomy,   in which both anterior and posterior tibial cortices were involved   with extension into the lateral aspect of the plateau in relation   to an anteroposterior line tangential to the medial edge of the   fibular head in the CT axial plane, was seen in 48 knees (71.6%)   in those without a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e and in seven (46.7%) in   those with a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We used microarray, bioin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>, the tapetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Development of the prethalamus is crucial for thalamocortical projection formation and is regulated by Olig2
<p>Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) pass through the prethalamus in the first step of their neural circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Although it has been supposed that the prethalamus is an intermediate target for thalamocortical projection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of this targeting. Here, we demonstrated the functional implications of the prethalamus in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this neural circuit. We show that Olig2 transcription factor, which is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of prosomere 3, regulates prethalamus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and loss of Olig2 results in reduced prethalamus size in early development, which is accompanied by expansion of the thalamic eminence (TE). Extension of TCAs is disorganized in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> dorsal thalamus, and initial elongation of TCAs is retarded in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> forebrain. Microarray analysis demonstrated upregulation of several axon guidance molecules, including <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> basal forebrain. <i>In situ</i> hybridization showed that the prethalamus in the wild type excluded the expression of <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, whereas loss of Olig2 resulted in reduction of this Ephas-negative area and the corresponding expansion of the Ephas-positive TE. Dissociated cultures of thalamic progenitor cells demonstrated that substrate-bound EphA3 suppresses neurite extension from dorsal thalamic neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 is involved in correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the prethalamus, which leads to exclusion of the EphA3-expressing region and is crucial for proper TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Our observation is the first report showing the molecular mechanisms underlying how the prethalamus acts on initial thalamocortical projection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil
<p>The immense diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacterial communities has stymied efforts to characterize individual taxa and document their global distributions. We analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s from 237 locations across six continents and found that only 2% of bacterial phylotypes (~500 phylotypes) consistently accounted for almost half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacterial communities worldwide. Despite the overwhelming diversity of bacterial communities, relatively few bacterial taxa are abundant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s globally. We clustered these dominant taxa into ecological groups to build the first global atlas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacterial taxa. Our study narrows down the immense number of bacterial taxa to a “most wanted” list that will be fruitful targets for genomic and cultivation-based efforts aimed at improving our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> microbes and their contributions to ecosystem functioning.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming results in a four-phase pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing carbon feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota influence plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>mance through plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on plant traits and whether plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback drives local plant diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota promote local plant diversity.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> plants but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, which plays a critical role in the plant response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

We investigated de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Endogenous callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of chlorophyll after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population.

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the proximal humerus. We divided   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es into three types: avulsion, split and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, split and   depression type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es is more reliable   than the Neer or AO classifications. These distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics
<p>Feedback with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota is an important determinant of terrestrial plant diversity. However, the factors regulating plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate forests.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics.</p>

<sec><title>Increasing Turnover</title><p>Rising concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are likely to stimulate plant growth, leading to increased biomass and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon stocks, thereby lessening the rate of the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. <bold>Van Groenigen <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 508, published online 24 April) report the results of a meta-analysis and modeling that show that increasing the concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> also stimulates microbial decomposition of organic carbon in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s, by roughly the same amount that it increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic carbon, leading to lower equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon inventories and limiting the accumulation of carbon. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s may not provide as much carbon storage as hoped.</p></sec>

Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the diffusion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore initiation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging data revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, whereas preventing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore initiation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we tested whether pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor pressure did not prevent pore initiation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these data provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell pressurization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore initiation and enlargement.</p>

Heterohexamers Formed by CcmK3 and CcmK4 Increase the Complexity of Beta Carboxysome Shells
<p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) encapsulate enzymes within a selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e, proteinaceous shell. Carboxysomes are BMCs containing ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase that enhance carbon dioxide fixation. The carboxysome shell consists of three structurally characterized protein types, each named after the oligomer they form: BMC-H (hexamer), BMC-P (pentamer), and BMC-T (trimer). These three protein types form cyclic homooligomers with pores at the center of symmetry that enable metabolite transport across the shell. Carboxysome shells contain multiple BMC-H paralogs, each with distinctly conserved residues surrounding the pore, which are assumed to be associated with specific metabolites. We studied the regulation of β-carboxysome shell composition by investigating the BMC-H genes <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> situated in a locus remote from other carboxysome genes. We made single and double deletion mutants of <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> in <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 and show that, unlike CcmK3, CcmK4 is necessary for optimal growth. In contrast to other CcmK proteins, CcmK3 does not form homohexamers; instead CcmK3 forms heterohexamers with CcmK4 with a 1:2 stoichiometry. The CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers form stacked dodecamers in a pH-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers potentially expand the range of permeability properties of metabolite channels in carboxysome shells. Moreover, the observed facultative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of dodecamers in solution suggests that carboxysome shell permeability may be dynamically attenuated by “capping” facet-embedded hexamers with a second hexamer. Because β-carboxysomes are obligately expressed, heterohexamer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and capping could provide a rapid and reversible means to alter metabolite flux across the shell in response to environmental/growth conditions.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue organization and pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion within a multicellular organism rely on coordinated cell division and cell-fate determination. In animals, cell fates are mainly determined by a cell lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, positional in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is thought to be the primary determinant of cell fates. However, our understanding of cell-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the histological and anatomical studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> of each cell type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic cell-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that cell-fate determination in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The inherited cell identity can subsequently be removed or modified by positional in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The instruction of cell-fate conversion is not a fast readout during root development. The final identity of a cell type is determined by the synergistic contribution from multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s of regulation, including symplastic communication across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during cell-fate instruction.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>m the crucial task of absorbing water from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

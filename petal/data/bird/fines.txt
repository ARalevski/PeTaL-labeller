Observation of fractional Chern insulators in a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>Topologically ordered phases are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al statistics rather than by symmetry breaking. First observed in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>ally filled continuum Landau level, topological order has since been proposed to arise more generally at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al fillings of topologically nontrivial Chern bands. Here we report the observation of gapped states at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al fillings of Harper-Hofstadter bands arising from the interplay of a magnetic field and a superlattice potential in a bilayer graphene–hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure. We observed phases at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al filling of bands with Chern indices [Formula]. Some of these phases, in [Formula] and [Formula] bands, are characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al Hall conductance—that is, they are known as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al Chern insulators and constitute an example of topological order beyond Landau levels.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>d using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>d as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and treatment.</p></sec>

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the number of invited and examined men, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, <i>P</i>=0.020). The number needed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> and the number needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-efficiency ratio was estimated to be €7770 per quality-adjusted life-years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing 65-year-old men for AAA is an effective preventive health measure and is highly cost-effective in a contemporary setting.

Wheat Vacuolar Iron Transporter TaVIT2 Transports Fe and Mn and Is Effective for Biofortification
<p>Increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of crops, known as biofortification, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, iron deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the iron content of staple crops such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortification of wheat, we functionally characterized homologs of the <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER</i> (<i>VIT</i>). The wheat genome contains two <i>VIT</i> paralogs, <i>TaVIT1</i> and <i>TaVIT2</i>, which have different expression patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) mutant defective in vacuolar iron transport. TaVIT2 also complemented a manganese transporter mutant but not a vacuolar zinc transporter mutant. By overexpressing <i>TaVIT2</i> under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in iron in white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flour</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>s, exceeding minimum legal fortification levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The antinutrient phytate was not increased and the iron in the white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flour</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> was bioavailable in vitro, suggesting that food products made from the biofortified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flour</span></strong> could contribute to improved iron nutrition. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar iron transport in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing existing homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong> root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong> root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong> roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong> roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong> root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and phenotype over 800 genetically modified mouse lines over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. Phenotyping includes the generation of a standardized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical phenotypes detected by the standard MGP primary phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Three of these seven lines had no clinical phenotype detected by the standard primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary phenotyping of mutant mice.</p>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>d as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> in the elderly.

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

At 3 years, we compared transplantation-free survival, echocardiographic right ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>, and unplanned interventions in the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Vital status and medical history were ascertained from annual medical records, death indexes, and phone interviews. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial. Transplantation-free survival for the RVPAS versus MBTS groups did not differ at 3 years (67% versus 61%; <i>P</i>=0.15) or with all available follow-up of 4.8±1.1 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.14). Pre-Fontan right ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> was lower in the RVPAS group than in the MBTS group (41.7<i>±</i>5.1% versus 44.7<i>±</i>6.0%; <i>P</i>=0.007), and right ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> deteriorated in RVPAS (<i>P</i>=0.004) but not MBTS (<i>P</i>=0.40) subjects (pre-Fontan minus 14-month mean, −3.25±8.24% versus 0.99±8.80%; <i>P</i>=0.009). The RVPAS versus MBTS treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.004); the hazard ratio favored the RVPAS before 5 months (hazard ratio=0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.88) but the MBTS beyond 1 year (hazard ratio=2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–4.62). By 3 years, RVPAS subjects had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (<i>P</i><0.001) with an increasing HR over time (<i>P</i>=0.005): <5 months, 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.60); from 5 months to 1 year, 1.94 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–3.69); and >1 year, 2.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.28–4.80).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>By 3 years, the Norwood procedure with RVPAS compared with MBTS was no longer associated with superior transplantation-free survival.

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty acids from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty acid elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid turnover. This phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong> LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness.

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to mortality after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased cardiovascular risk. All patients received a systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>d as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, mortality was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling additional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients undergoing 2546 surgeries. Patients had a median age of 74 years and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day mortality. The difference was retained at 1 year with mortality rates of 22.5% (95% CI, 17.6–27.4) versus 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9–10.7). Thirty-day mortality was comparable among patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (280/397, 71%) versus those with at least 1 additional criterion (10.4%; 95% CI, 6.7–15.7, versus 8.7%; 95% CI, 4.2–16.7; <i>P</i>=0.684).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PMI is a common complication after noncardiac surgery and, despite early detection during routine clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, is associated with substantial short- and long-term mortality.

We excluded patients with prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and those randomized only to medical therapy. The primary outcome was SCD as adjudicated by a blinded committee. A Cox model was used to examine and identify predictors of SCD. The Fine and Gray method was used to estimate the incidence of SCD accounting for the competing risk of other deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over a median follow-up of 46 months, 113 of 1411 patients who received CABG without (n = 934) or with (n = 477) surgical ventricular reconstruction had SCD; 311 died of other causes. The mean left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> at enrollment was 28±9%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of SCD was 8.5%. Patients who had SCD and those who did not die were younger and had fewer comorbid conditions than did those who died of causes other than SCD.

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, genomes of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative genomics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume genomes as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these genomes and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>ation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further genomics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> of legume comparative genomics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative Genomics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice
<p><i>Phosphate overaccumulator2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in rice protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the “WCGPC” motif of Trxhs were required for the interaction. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts confirmed the interaction of OsPHO2 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and PHOSPHATE1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and rice seedlings. Characterization of rice <i>pho2</i> complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic <i>OsPHO2</i> or <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native <i>OsPHO2</i>. Moreover, the suppression of <i>OsTrxh1</i> (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>-tune its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in rice.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile vegetative phase of development to an adult vegetative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated vegetative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate vegetative phase change in Arabidopsis.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

Clicky hip alone is not a true risk factor for developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A clicky hip is a common referral for clinical and sonographic   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). There is   controversy regarding whether it represents a true risk factor for   pathological DDH. Therefore a 20-year prospective, longitudinal,   observational study was undertaken to assess the relationship between   the presence of a neonatal clicky hip and pathological DDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 362 infants from 1997 to 2016 were referred with clicky   hips to our ‘one-stop’ paediatric hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing clinic. Hips were   assessed clinically for instability and by ultrasound imaging using   a simplified Graf/Harcke classification. Dislocated or dislocatable   hips were classified as Graf Type IV hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at presentation was 13.8 weeks (12.8 to 14.7). In   all 351 out of 362 children (97.0%) had Graf Type I hips (normal)   that required no treatment. Nine children (2.5%) had Graf Type II   hips but all resolved to Graf Type I hips on follow-up scans. One   child (0.3%) had Graf Type III hip dysplasia and one child (0.3%)   had an irreducible hip dislocation. The two pathological hips were   associated with unilateral limited hip abduction. Mean referrals increased   from 12.9 to 23.3 each year (p = 0.002) from the first decade of   the study to the second, driven by increasing primary care referrals   (5.5 <i>versus</i> 16.7 per year, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Most clicky hips required no treatment other than reassurance   to parents. Clicky hips with a normal hip examination should be   considered a variant of normal childhood and not a risk factor for   DDH. However, an abnormal hip examination including unilateral limited   hip abduction should prompt urgent further investigations.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1533–6.</p></sec>

Generation and validation of a zebrafish model of EAST (epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy) syndrome
<p>Recessive mutations in <i>KCNJ10</i>, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, were recently identified as the cause of EAST syndrome, a severe and disabling multi-organ disorder consisting of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy that becomes clinically apparent with seizures in infancy. A <i>Kcnj10</i> knockout mouse shows postnatal mortality and is therefore not suitable for drug discovery. Because zebrafish are ideal for <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing for potential therapeutics, we tested whether <i>kcnj10</i> knockdown in zebrafish would fill this need. We cloned zebrafish <i>kcnj10</i> and demonstrated that its function is equivalent to that of human <i>KCNJ10</i>. We next injected splice- and translation-blocking <i>kcnj10</i> antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and reproduced the cardinal symptoms of EAST syndrome – ataxia, epilepsy and renal tubular defects. Several of these phenotypes could be assayed in an automated manner. We could rescue the morphant phenotype with complementary RNA (cRNA) encoding human wild-type KCNJ10, but not with cRNA encoding a KCNJ10 mutation identified in individuals with EAST syndrome. Our results suggest that zebrafish will be a valuable tool to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> for compounds that are potentially therapeutic for EAST syndrome or its individual symptoms. Knockdown of <i>kcnj10</i> represents the first zebrafish model of a salt-losing tubulopathy, which has relevance for blood pressure control.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al shortening and ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte metabolism and function.</p></sec>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>d as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during testing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT testing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT testing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT testing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death. ISM was relatively uncommon and is associated with several widely available patient characteristics. These data may inform ICD system selection and a targeted approach to CT.</p></sec>

Sex and Race Differences in Lifetime Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Lifetime risk of heart failure has been estimated to range from 20% to 46% in diverse sex and race groups. However, lifetime risk estimates for the 2 HF phenotypes, HF with preserved ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> (HFrEF), are not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Participant-level data from 2 large prospective cohort studies, the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) and MESA (Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), were pooled, excluding individuals with prevalent HF at baseline. Remaining lifetime risk estimates for HFpEF (EF ≥45%) and HFrEF (EF <45%) were determined at different index ages with the use of a modified Kaplan-Meier method with mortality and the other HF subtype as competing risks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 12 417 participants >45 years of age (22.2% blacks, 44.8% men) who were followed up for median duration of 11.6 years with 2178 overall incident HF events with 561 HFrEF events and 726 HFpEF events. At the index age of 45 years, the lifetime risk for any HF through 90 years of age was higher in men than women (27.4% versus 23.8%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime risk for HFrEF was higher in men than women (10.6% versus 5.8%). In contrast, the lifetime risk for HFpEF was similar in men and women. In race-stratified analyses, lifetime risk for overall HF was higher in nonblacks than blacks (25.9% versus 22.4%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime risk for HFpEF was higher in nonblacks than blacks (11.2% versus 7.7%), whereas that for HFrEF was similar across the 2 groups. Among participants with antecedent myocardial infarction before HF diagnosis, the remaining lifetime risks for HFpEF and HFrEF were up to 2.5-fold and 4-fold higher, respectively, compared with those without antecedent myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risks for HFpEF and HFrEF vary by sex, race, and history of antecedent myocardial infarction. These insights into the distribution of HF risk and its subtypes could inform the development of targeted strategies to improve population-level HF prevention and control.</p></sec>

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart failure syndrome precipitated by intense emotional stress.

Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction.

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at diagnosis was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. Children with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following diagnosis. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

SIRT2 Acts as a Cardioprotective Deacetylase in Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by stresses such as aging and neurohumoral activation is an independent risk factor for heart failure and is considered a target for the treatment of heart failure. However, the mechanisms underlying pathological cardiac hypertrophy remain largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the roles of SIRT2 in aging-related and angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Male C57BL/6J wild-type and <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice were subjected to the investigation of aging-related cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was also induced by Ang II (1.3 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks) in male C57BL/6J <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice, cardiac-specific <i>SIRT2</i> transgenic (<i>SIRT2</i>-Tg) mice, and their respective littermates (8 to ≈12 weeks old). Metformin (200 mg/kg/d) was used to treat wild-type and <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice infused with Ang II. Cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac function were examined in these mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SIRT2 protein expression levels were downregulated in hypertrophic hearts from mice. <i>Sirt2</i> knockout markedly exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and decreased cardiac ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al shortening in aged (24-month-old) mice and Ang II–infused mice. Conversely, cardiac-specific <i>SIRT2</i> overexpression protected the hearts against Ang II–induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and rescued cardiac function. Mechanistically, SIRT2 maintained the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in aged and Ang II–induced hypertrophic hearts in vivo as well as in cardiomyocytes in vitro. We identified the liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the major upstream kinase of AMPK, as the direct target of SIRT2. SIRT2 bound to LKB1 and deacetylated it at lysine 48, which promoted the phosphorylation of LKB1 and the subsequent activation of LKB1-AMPK signaling. Remarkably, the loss of SIRT2 blunted the response of AMPK to metformin treatment in mice infused with Ang II and repressed the metformin-mediated reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and protection of cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SIRT2 promotes AMPK activation by deacetylating the kinase LKB1. Loss of SIRT2 reduces AMPK activation, promotes aging-related and Ang II–induced cardiac hypertrophy, and blunts metformin-mediated cardioprotective effects. These findings indicate that SIRT2 will be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in aging- and stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec>

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period.

Efficacy and Safety of a Pharmaco-Invasive Strategy With Half-Dose Alteplase Versus Primary Angioplasty in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) cannot be offered to all patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Pharmaco-invasive (PhI) strategy has been proposed as a valuable alternative for eligible patients with STEMI. We conducted a randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of a PhI strategy with half-dose fibrinolytic regimen versus PPCI in patients with STEMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EARLY-MYO trial (Early Routine Catheterization After Alteplase Fibrinolysis Versus Primary PCI in Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction) was an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing a PhI strategy with half-dose alteplase versus PPCI in patients with STEMI 18 to 75 years of age presenting ≤6 hours after symptom onset but with an expected PCI-related delay. The primary end point of the study was complete epicardial and myocardial reperfusion after PCI, de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fine</span></strong>d as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 3, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction myocardial perfusion grade 3, and ST-segment resolution ≥70%. We also measured infarct size and left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> with cardiac magnetic resonance and recorded 30-day clinical and safety outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 344 patients from 7 centers were randomized to PhI (n=171) or PPCI (n=173). PhI was noninferior (and even superior) to PPCI for the primary end point (34.2% versus 22.8%, <i>P</i> <sub>noninferiority</sub><0.05, <i>P</i><sub>superiority</sub>=0.022), with no significant differences in the frequency of the individual components of the combined end point: thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow 3 (91.3% versus 89.2%, <i>P</i>=0.580), thrombolysis in myocardial infarction myocardial perfusion grade 3 (65.8% versus 62.9%, <i>P</i>=0.730), and ST-segment resolution ≥70% (50.9% versus 45.5%, <i>P</i>=0.377). Infarct size (23.3%±11.3% versus 25.8%±13.7%, <i>P</i>=0.101) and left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> (52.2%±11.0% versus 51.4%±12.0%, <i>P</i>=0.562) were similar in both groups. No significant differences occurred in 30-day rates of total death (0.6% versus 1.2%, <i>P</i>=1.0), reinfarction (0.6% versus 0.6%, <i>P</i>=1.0), heart failure (13.5% versus 16.2%, <i>P</i>=0.545), major bleeding events (0.6% versus 0%, <i>P</i>=0.497), or intracranial hemorrhage (0% versus 0%), but minor bleeding (26.9% versus 11.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) was observed more often in the PhI group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>For patients with STEMI presenting ≤6 hours after symptom onset and with an expected PCI-related delay, a PhI strategy with half-dose alteplase and timely PCI offers more complete epicardial and myocardial reperfusion when compared with PPCI. Adequately powered trials with this reperfusion strategy to assess clinical and safety outcomes are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Effect of Ferric Carboxymaltose on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Iron deficiency is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and poor outcomes. Whether correction of iron deficiency with (intravenous) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) affects peak oxygen consumption [peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>], an objective measure of exercise intolerance in HF, has not been examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> ≤45%) and mild to moderate symptoms despite optimal HF medication. Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with FCM for 24 weeks or standard of care. The primary end point was the change in peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary end points included the effect on hematinic and cardiac biomarkers, quality of life, and safety. For the primary analysis, patients who died had a value of 0 imputed for 24-week peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of imputation of missing peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 172 patients with HF were studied and received FCM (n=86) or standard of care (control group, n=86). At baseline, the groups were well matched; mean age was 64 years, 75% were male, mean left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> was 32%, and peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> was 13.5 mL/min/kg. FCM significantly increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. At 24 weeks, peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> had decreased in the control group (least square means −1.19±0.389 mL/min/kg) but was maintained on FCM (−0.16±0.387 mL/min/kg; <i>P</i>=0.020 between groups). In a sensitivity analysis, in which missing data were not imputed, peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> at 24 weeks decreased by −0.63±0.375 mL/min/kg in the control group and by −0.16±0.373 mL/min/kg in the FCM group; <i>P</i>=0.23 between groups). Patients’ global assessment and functional class as assessed by the New York Heart Association improved on FCM versus standard of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Treatment with intravenous FCM in patients with HF and iron deficiency improves iron stores. Although a favorable effect on peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> was observed on FCM, compared with standard of care in the primary analysis, this effect was highly sensitive to the imputation strategy for peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> among patients who died. Whether FCM is associated with an improved outcome in these high-risk patients needs further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations in EPHB4 Cause a Second Form of Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation (CM-AVM2) Deregulating RAS-MAPK Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are localized and occur sporadically. However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM. Previously, we identified <i>RASA1</i> mutations in 50% of patients with CM-AVM. Herein we studied non-RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a genome-wide linkage study on a CM-AVM family. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM-AVM families. We identified a candidate gene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ed it in a large series of patients. The influence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found evidence for linkage in 2 loci. Whole-exome sequencing data unraveled 4 distinct damaging variants in <i>EPHB4</i> in 5 families that cosegregated with CM-AVM. Overall, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing of <i>EPHB4</i> detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 led to a premature stop codon or splice-site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are nonsynonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations confirmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multifocal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We found <i>EPHB4</i> mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The phenotype, CM-AVM2, mimics <i>RASA1</i>-related CM-AVM1 and also hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. <i>RASA1</i>-encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlight the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4-RAS-ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for AVMs.</p></sec>

High-Intensity Interval Training in Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction

The present multicenter trial compared 12 weeks of supervised interventions of HIIT, MCT, or a recommendation of regular exercise (RRE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two hundred sixty-one patients with left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> ≤35% and New York Heart Association class II to III were randomly assigned to HIIT at 90% to 95% of maximal heart rate, MCT at 60% to 70% of maximal heart rate, or RRE. Thereafter, patients were encouraged to continue exercising on their own. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, after the intervention, and at follow-up after 52 weeks. Primary end point was a between-group comparison of change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Groups did not differ in age (median, 60 years), sex (19% women), ischemic pathogenesis (59%), or medication. Change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks was not different between HIIT and MCT (<i>P</i>=0.45); left ventricular end-diastolic diameter changes compared with RRE were −2.8 mm (−5.2 to −0.4 mm; <i>P</i>=0.02) in HIIT and −1.2 mm (−3.6 to 1.2 mm; <i>P</i>=0.34) in MCT. There was also no difference between HIIT and MCT in peak oxygen uptake (<i>P</i>=0.70), but both were superior to RRE. However, none of these changes was maintained at follow-up after 52 weeks. Serious adverse events were not statistically different during supervised intervention or at follow-up at 52 weeks (HIIT, 39%; MCT, 25%; RRE, 34%; <i>P</i>=0.16).

Fractional Flow Reserve and Cardiac Events in Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We evaluated the prognosis of deferred and revascularized coronary stenoses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al flow reserve (FFR) measurement to assess its revascularization threshold in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The IRIS-FFR registry (Interventional Cardiology Research In-cooperation Society <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>al Flow Reserve) prospectively enrolled 5846 patients with ≥1coronary lesion with FFR measurement. Revascularization was deferred in 6468 lesions and performed in 2165 lesions after FFR assessment. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) at a median follow-up of 1.9 years and analyzed on a per-lesion basis. A marginal Cox model accounted for correlated data in patients with multiple lesions, and a model to predict per-lesion outcomes was adjusted for confounding factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>For deferred lesions, the risk of major adverse cardiac events demonstrated a significant, inverse relationship with FFR (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.08; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not observed in revascularized lesions (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.70). For lesions with FFR ≥0.76, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was not significantly different between deferred and revascularized lesions. Conversely, in lesions with FFR ≤0.75, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was significantly lower in revascularized lesions than in deferred lesions (for FFR 0.71–0.75, adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.021; for FFR ≤0.70, adjusted hazard ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.84; <i>P</i>=0.012).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This large, prospective registry showed that the FFR value was linearly associated with the risk of cardiac events in deferred lesions.

Cardiovascular Toxicity of Illicit Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use

Using transthoracic echocardiography and coronary computed tomography angiography, we assessed 3 primary outcome measures: left ventricular (LV) systolic function (left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>), LV diastolic function (early relaxation velocity), and coronary atherosclerosis (coronary artery plaque volume).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with nonusers, AAS users demonstrated relatively reduced LV systolic function (mean±SD left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> = 52±11% versus 63±8%; <i>P</i><0.001) and diastolic function (early relaxation velocity = 9.3±2.4 cm/second versus 11.1±2.0 cm/second; <i>P</i><0.001). Users currently taking AAS at the time of evaluation (N=58) showed significantly reduced LV systolic (left ventricular ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> = 49±10% versus 58±10%; <i>P</i><0.001) and diastolic function (early relaxation velocity = 8.9±2.4 cm/second versus 10.1±2.4 cm/second; <i>P</i>=0.035) compared with users currently off-drug (N=28). In addition, AAS users demonstrated higher coronary artery plaque volume than nonusers (median [interquartile range] 3 [0, 174] mL<sup>3</sup> versus 0 [0, 69] mL<sup>3</sup>; <i>P</i>=0.012). Lifetime AAS dose was strongly associated with coronary atherosclerotic burden (increase [95% confidence interval] in rank of plaque volume for each 10-year increase in cumulative duration of AAS use: 0.60 SD units [0.16–1.03 SD units]; <i>P</i>=0.008).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term AAS use appears to be associated with myocardial dysfunction and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis.

Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor-Dependent Pathway Drives Epicardial Adipose Tissue Formation After Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Epicardial adipose tissue volume and coronary artery disease are strongly associated, even after accounting for overall body mass. Despite its pathophysiological significance, the origin and paracrine signaling pathways that regulate epicardial adipose tissue’s formation and expansion are unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a novel modified mRNA-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing approach to probe the effect of individual paracrine factors on epicardial progenitors in the adult heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using 2 independent lineage-tracing strategies in murine models, we show that cells originating from the Wt1<sup>+</sup> mesothelial lineage, which includes epicardial cells, differentiate into epicardial adipose tissue after myocardial infarction. This differentiation process required Wt1 expression in this lineage and was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) activation. IGF1R inhibition within this lineage significantly reduced its adipogenic differentiation in the context of exogenous, IGF1-modified mRNA stimulation. Moreover, IGF1R inhibition significantly reduced Wt1 lineage cell differentiation into adipocytes after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results establish IGF1R signaling as a key pathway that governs epicardial adipose tissue formation in the context of myocardial injury by redirecting the fate of Wt1<sup>+</sup> lineage cells.

Proteomic Analysis Implicates Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein as a Novel Mediator of Occlusive Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease characterized by excessive proliferation of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Hereditary PAH (HPAH) is often caused by mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 gene (<i>BMPR2</i>). However, the mechanisms by which these mutations cause PAH remain unclear. Therefore, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ed for dysregulated proteins in blood-outgrowth ECs of HPAH patients with <i>BMPR2</i> mutations compared with healthy control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 416 proteins were detected with 2-dimensional PAGE in combination with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis, of which 22 exhibited significantly altered abundance in blood-outgrowth ECs from patients with HPAH. One of these proteins, translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), was selected for further study because of its well-established role in promoting tumor cell growth and survival. Immunostaining showed marked upregulation of TCTP in lungs from patients with HPAH and idiopathic PAH, associated with remodeled vessels of complex lesions. Increased TCTP expression was also evident in the SU5416 rat model of severe and irreversible PAH, associated with intimal lesions, colocalizing with proliferating ECs and the adventitia of remodeled vessels but not in the vascular media. Furthermore, silencing of TCTP expression increased apoptosis and abrogated the hyperproliferative phenotype of blood-outgrowth ECs from patients with HPAH, raising the possibility that TCTP may be a link in the emergence of apoptosis-resistant, hyperproliferative vascular cells after EC apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>Proteomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing identified TCTP as a novel mediator of endothelial prosurvival and growth signaling in PAH, possibly contributing to occlusive pulmonary vascular remodeling triggered by EC apoptosis.</p></sec>

Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Transthyretin-Related Versus Light-Chain Cardiac Amyloidosis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Immunoglobulin amyloid light-chain (AL)-related cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has a worse prognosis than either wild-type (ATTRwt) or mutant (ATTRm) transthyretin (TTR) CA. Detailed echocardiographic studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis but not in TTR amyloidosis and might give insight into this difference. We assessed cardiac structure and function and outcome in a large population of patients with CA and compared findings in TTR and AL-related disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We analyzed 172 patients with CA (AL amyloidosis, n=80; ATTRm, n=36; ATTRwt, n=56) by standard echocardiography and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal (LS), radial, and circumferential strains. Despite a preserved LV ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong> (55±12%), LS was severely impaired in CA. Standard measures of LV function and speckle-tracking imaging worsened as wall thickness increased, whereas apical LS was preserved regardless of the pathogenesis of CA and the degree of wall thickening. Compared with ATTRm and AL amyloidosis, ATTRwt was characterized by greater LV wall thickness and lower ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fraction</span></strong>. LS was more depressed in both ATTRwt and AL amyloidosis (−11±3% and −12±4%, respectively, <i>P</i>=0.54) than in ATTRm (−15±4%, <i>P</i><0.01 versus AL amyloidosis and ATTRwt). TTR-related causes were favorable predictors of survival, whereas LS and advanced New York Heart Association class were negative predictors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients with CA, worsening LV function correlated with increasing wall thickness regardless of pathogenesis. Patients with ATTRwt had a statistically greater wall thickness but lesser mortality than those with AL amyloidosis, despite very similar degrees of LS impairment. This paradox suggests an additional mechanism for LV dysfunction in AL amyloidosis, such as previously demonstrated light-chain toxicity.</p></sec>

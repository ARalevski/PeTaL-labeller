The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation is impaired during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> degradation. In fact, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i>-degrading activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking photosynthesis in presenescent leaves with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

Photochemistry beyond the red limit in chlorophyll f–containing photosystems
<p>Photosystems I and II convert solar energy into the chemical energy that powers life. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l a photochemistry, using red light (680 to 700 nm), is near universal and is considered to define the energy “red limit” of oxygenic photosynthesis. We present biophysical studies on the photosystems from a cyanobacterium grown in far-red light (750 nm). The few long-wavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls present are well resolved from each other and from the majority pigment, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l a. Charge separation in photosystem I and II uses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l f at 745 nm and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l f (or d) at 727 nm, respectively. Each photosystem has a few even longer-wavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls f that collect light and pass excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active pigments. These photosystems function beyond the red limit using far-red pigments in only a few key positions.</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (Maintenance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the maintenance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the maintenance of photosystem I and specific protein-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Global rates of marine sulfate reduction and implications for sub–sea-floor metabolic activities
<p>Sulfate reduction is a globally important redox process in marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s, yet global rates are poorly quantified. We developed an artificial neural network trained with 199 sulfate profiles, constrained with geomorphological and geochemical maps to estimate global sulfate-reduction rate distributions. Globally, 11.3 teramoles of sulfate are reduced yearly (~15% of previous estimates), accounting for the oxidation of 12 to 29% of the organic carbon flux to the sea floor. Combined with global cell distributions in marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s, these results indicate a strong contrast in sub–sea-floor prokaryote habitats: In continental margins, global cell numbers in sulfate-depleted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong> exceed those in the overlying sulfate-bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong> by one order of magnitude, whereas in the abyss, most life occurs in oxic and/or sulfate-reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l precursor proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion are hindered relative to those in monovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century
<p>Ocean acidification refers to the lowering of the ocean’s pH due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Coral reef calcification is expected to decrease as the oceans become more acidic. Dissolving calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) sands could greatly exacerbate reef loss associated with reduced calcification but is presently poorly constrained. Here we show that CaCO<sub>3</sub> dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion in reef <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state (Ω<sub>ar</sub>) of overlying seawater and that CaCO<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong> dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion is 10-fold more sensitive to ocean acidification than coral calcification.

Release of mineral-bound water prior to subduction tied to shallow seismogenic slip off Sumatra
<p>Plate-boundary fault rupture during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman subduction earthquake extended closer to the trench than expected, increasing earthquake and tsunami size. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 362 sampled incoming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s offshore northern Sumatra, revealing recent release of fresh water within the deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s. Thermal modeling links this freshening to amorphous silica dehydration driven by rapid burial-induced temperature increases in the past 9 million years. Complete dehydration of silicates is expected before plate subduction, contrasting with prevailing models for subduction seismogenesis calling for fluid production during subduction. Shallow slip offshore Sumatra appears driven by diagenetic strengthening of deeply buried fault-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s, contrasting with weakening proposed for the shallow Tohoku-Oki 2011 rupture, but our results are applicable to other thickly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>ed subduction zones including those with limited earthquake records.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and intermediates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Five-dimensional imaging of freezing emulsions with solute effects
<p>The interaction of objects with a moving solidification front is a common feature of many industrial and natural processes such as metal processing, the growth of single crystals, the cryopreservation of cells, or the formation of sea ice. Interaction of solidification fronts with objects leads to different outcomes, from total rejection of the objects to their complete engulfment. We imaged the freezing of emulsions in five dimensions (space, time, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e concentration) with confocal microscopy. We showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e induces long-range interactions that determine the solidification microstructure. The local increase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e concentration enhances premelting, which controls the engulfment of droplets by the front and the evolution of grain boundaries. Freezing emulsions may be a good analog of many solidification systems where objects interact with a solidification interface.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components assemble to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at an early stage of PSII de novo assembly and of PSII repair under high-light conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC assembly is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family

Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening
<p>Through natural or human selection, many fleshy fruits have evolved vivid external or internal coloration, which often develops during ripening. Such developmental changes in color are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation. Here, we demonstrated that natural variation in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit peel degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation. Taken together, these results reveal allelic variation underlying an important fruit quality trait and a molecular genetic mechanism associated with apple domestication.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two <i>Helicoverpa</i> species
<p>Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are soluble proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>H. assulta</i>. We expressed the protein in bacteria and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion, CSP4 is partly extruded from the proboscis. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion of protein can also fill a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking.</p>

A molecular perovskite solid solution with piezoelectricity stronger than lead zirconate titanate

The most effective piezoelectric materials are ceramic solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions in which the piezoelectric effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). Ceramics are not ideal for a variety of applications owing to some of their mechanical properties.

Structural basis for blue-green light harvesting and energy dissipation in diatoms

Diatom ooze—A large marine mercury sink

We used high-re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion cores from marine Antarctica to estimate Holocene global mercury accumulation in biogenic siliceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sediment</span></strong>s (diatom ooze). Diatom ooze exhibits the highest mercury accumulation rates ever reported for the marine environment and provides a large sink of anthropogenic mercury, surpassing existing model estimates by as much as a factor of 7. Anthropogenic pollution of the Southern Ocean began ~150 years ago, and up to 20% of anthropogenic mercury emitted to the atmosphere may have been stored in diatom ooze. These findings reveal the crucial role of diatoms as a fast vector for mercury sequestration and diatom ooze as a large marine mercury sink.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>e-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p>Plastid isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes carotenoids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, tocopherols, and multiple hormones, are essential for plant growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i>SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the formation of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the formation of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced formation of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l content and autophagosome formation and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> plants but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation, which plays a critical role in the plant response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

Physio-Genetic Dissection of Dark-Induced Leaf Senescence and Timing Its Reversal in Barley

The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-affinity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin condensation, more DNA fragmentation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent. Reversal of DILS by re-exposure of the plants from dark to light was possible until but not later than day 7 of dark exposure and was accompanied by regained photosynthesis, increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l, and reversal of Rfd, despite activation of macro-autophagy-related genes.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

Silencing of three genes, <i>TRX m1</i>, <i>TRX m2</i>, and <i>TRX m4</i> (<i>TRX ms</i>), led to pale-green leaves, a significantly reduced 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-synthesizing capacity, and reduced accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and its metabolic intermediates in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contents of ALA dehydratase, protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase, the I subunit of Mg-chelatase, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM), and NADPH-proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase were decreased in triple <i>TRX m-</i>silenced seedlings compared with the wild type, although the transcript levels of the corresponding genes were not altered significantly. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed a physical interaction between the TRX m isoforms and CHLM. 4-Acetoamido-4-maleimidylstilbene-2,2-disulfonate labeling showed the regulatory impact of TRX ms on the CHLM redox status. Since CHLM also is regulated by NTRC (Richter et al., 2013), we assessed the concurrent functions of TRX m and NTRC in the control of CHLM. Combined deficiencies of three TRX m isoforms and NTRC led to a cumulative decrease in leaf pigmentation, TBS intermediate contents, ALA synthesis rate, and CHLM activity. We discuss the coordinated roles of TRX m and NTRC in the redox control of CHLM stability with its corollary activity in the TBS pathway.</p>

Photosynthetic Efficiency as Bioindicator of Environmental Pressure in <i>A. halleri</i>
<p>In earlier ecophysiological studies that were conducted on <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> plants, scientists focused on the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation but did not take into consideration the environmental factors that can significantly affect the physiological responses of plants in situ. In this study, we investigated <i>A. halleri</i> that was growing on two nonmetalliferous and three metalliferous sites, which were characterized by different environmental conditions. We compared these populations in order to find differences within the metallicolous and nonmetallicolous groups that have not yet been investigated. The concentrations of several elements in the plant and soil samples also were investigated. To our knowledge, the concentration and fluorescence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l were measured for <i>A. halleri</i> in situ for the first time. Our study confirmed the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn for each metallicolous population. For the metallicolous populations, the inhibition of parameters that describe the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus with increasing accumulations of heavy metals in the shoots also was observed. It was found that the nonmetallicolous plant populations from the summit of Ciemniak Mountain had larger antenna dimensions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l content but a lower percentage of active reaction centers. To our knowledge, in this study, the internal high physiological diversity within the populations that inhabit metalliferous and nonmetalliferous sites is presented for the first time.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide (Pchlide), a precursor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and temperature between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder temperature (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower temperature, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of temperatures.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the insertion of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C terminus. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-terminal extension, which harbors the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lack the conserved phosphorylation site found in a C-terminal extension of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-terminal extension for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In conjunction with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion over a sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other compounds had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium ion current induced by muscarinic stimulation (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct current–voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ion. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solut</span></strong>ions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

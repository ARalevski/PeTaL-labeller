Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that wall ingrowth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of wall ingrowths adjacent to cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile leaves, but dramatically less so in mature adult leaves, an observation consistent with PP TC development reflecting vegetative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of wall ingrowths was observed in rejuvenated leaves following prolonged defoliation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult leaves correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in wall ingrowth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion were observed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that wall ingrowth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of wall ingrowth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to wall ingrowth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

An intramembrane sensory circuit monitors sortase A–mediated processing of streptococcal adhesins
<p>Bacterial adhesins mediate adhesion to substrates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation. Adhesins of the LPXTG family are posttranslationally processed by the cell membrane–localized peptidase sortase A, which cleaves the LPXTG motif. This generates a short C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature adhesin is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding adhesins of the oral bacterium <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> were differentially expressed depending on whether the bacteria were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be coordinately regulated. Deletion of <i>sspA</i> and <i>sspB (sspAB)</i>, both of which encode LPXTG-containing adhesins, unexpectedly enhanced adhesion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation. C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing adhesin localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the <i>scaCBA</i> operon encoding the lipoprotein adhesin ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation. This C-pep–driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive bacteria. This quality control mechanism ensures that the bacteria can form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s under diverse environmental conditions and may play a role in optimizing adhesion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation.</p>

Exposed subsurface ice sheets in the Martian mid-latitudes
<p>Thick <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>s cover broad regions of the Martian mid-latitudes with a smooth mantle; erosion in these regions creates scarps that expose the internal structure of the mantle. We investigated eight of these locations and found that they expose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>s of water ice that can be >100 meters thick, extending downward from depths as shallow as 1 to 2 meters below the surface. The scarps are actively retreating because of sublimation of the exposed water ice. The ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>s likely originated as snowfall during Mars’ high-obliquity periods and have now compacted into massive, fractured, and layered ice. We expect the vertical structure of Martian ice-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>s to preserve a record of ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion and past climate.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Pyocyanin degradation by a tautomerizing demethylase inhibits <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms
<p>The opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> produces colorful redox-active metabolites called phenazines, which underpin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> development, virulence, and clinical outcomes. Although phenazines exist in many forms, the best studied is pyocyanin. Here, we describe pyocyanin demethylase (PodA), a hitherto uncharacterized protein that oxidizes the pyocyanin methyl group to formaldehyde and reduces the pyrazine ring via an unusual tautomerizing demethylation reaction. Treatment with PodA disrupts <i>P. aeruginosa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> formation similarly to DNase, suggesting interference with the pyocyanin-dependent release of extracellular DNA into the matrix. PodA-dependent pyocyanin demethylation also restricts established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> aggregate populations experiencing anoxic conditions. Together, these results show that modulating extracellular redox-active metabolites can influence the fitness of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>-forming microorganism.</p>

The Structural Integrity of Lignin Is Crucial for Resistance against <i>Striga hermonthica</i> Parasitism in Rice
<p><i>Striga</i> species are parasitic weeds that seriously constrain the productivity of food staples, including cereals and legumes, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In eastern and central Africa, <i>Striga</i> spp. infest as much as 40 million hectares of smallholder farmland causing total crop failure during severe infestation. As the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance are yet to be elucidated, we undertook a comparative metabolome study using the <i>Striga</i>-resistant rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ and the susceptible cultivar ‘Koshihikari’. We found that a number of metabolites accumulated preferentially in the <i>Striga</i>-resistant cultivar upon <i>Striga hermonthica</i> infection. Most apparent was increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of lignin, a phenylpropanoid polymer mainly composed of <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) aromatic units, around the site of interaction in Nipponbare. The increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of lignin was accompanied by induction of the expression of corresponding enzyme-encoding genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In addition, perturbing normal lignin composition by knocking down or overexpressing the genes that regulate lignin composition, i.e. <i>p</i>-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE or FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE, enhanced susceptibility of Nipponbare to <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i> infection. These results demonstrate that enhanced lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion and maintenance of the structural integrity of lignin polymers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ed at the infection site are crucial for postattachment resistance against <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i>.</p>

Exocyst Subunit EXO70H4 Has a Specific Role in Callose Synthase Secretion and Silica Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Biogenesis of the plant secondary cell wall involves many important aspects, such as phenolic compound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion and often silica encrustation. Previously, we demonstrated the importance of the exocyst subunit EXO70H4 for biogenesis of the trichome secondary cell wall, namely for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of the autofluorescent and callose-rich cell wall layer. Here, we reveal that EXO70H4-driven cell wall biogenesis is constitutively active in the mature trichome, but also can be activated elsewhere upon pathogen attack, giving this study a broader significance with an overlap into phytopathology. To address the specificity of EXO70H4 among the EXO70 family, we complemented the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant by 18 different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EXO70 paralogs subcloned under the EXO70H4 promoter. Only EXO70H4 had the capacity to rescue the <i>exo70H4</i>-<i>1</i> trichome phenotype. Callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion phenotype of <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant is caused by impaired secretion of PMR4, a callose synthase responsible for the synthesis of callose in the trichome. PMR4 colocalizes with EXO70H4 on plasma membrane microdomains that do not develop in the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant. Using energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis, we show that both EXO70H4- and PMR4-dependent callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in the trichome are essential for cell wall silicification.</p>

Phosphoethanolamine cellulose: A naturally produced chemically modified cellulose
<p>Cellulose is a major contributor to the chemical and mechanical properties of plants and assumes structural roles in bacterial communities termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>s. We find that <i>Escherichia coli</i> produces chemically modified cellulose that is required for extracellular matrix assembly and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong> architecture. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the intact and insoluble material elucidates the zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine modification that had evaded detection by conventional methods. Installation of the phosphoethanolamine group requires BcsG, a proposed phosphoethanolamine transferase, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biofilm</span></strong>-promoting cyclic diguanylate monophosphate input through a BcsE-BcsF-BcsG transmembrane signaling pathway. The <i>bcsEFG</i> operon is present in many bacteria, including <i>Salmonella</i> species, that also produce the modified cellulose. The discovery of phosphoethanolamine cellulose and the genetic and molecular basis for its production offers opportunities to modulate its production in bacteria and inspires efforts to biosynthetically engineer alternatively modified cellulosic materials.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong> one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different environments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>s around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen vegetative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the vegetative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the vegetative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen vegetative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ation, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ated soils.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films

The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong> water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Evolution of alluvial mudrock forced by early land plants

We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that alluvium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ed after land plant evolution contains a proportion of mudrock that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in alluvium from the preceding 90% of Earth’s history.

But despite progress, benefits analysis for health effects is needlessly constrained by analytic practices that are scientifically outdated and inconsistent with economic theory. These limitations can result in exclusion of important health effects from the estimated benefits of reducing exposure to toxic environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants, which, in turn, affects net benefits calculations that inform public policy. Fortunately, economic theory and scientific advances in the risk assessment literature provide a way forward.</p>

Biological control of aragonite formation in stony corals
<p>Little is known about how stony corals build their calcareous skeletons. There are two prevailing hypotheses: that it is a physicochemically dominated process and that it is a biologically mediated one. Using a combination of ultrahigh-resolution three<i>-</i>dimensional imaging and two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion is biologically driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ed in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid mineral phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic precipitation of aragonite.</p>

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef
<p>With the rapid rise in pollution-associated nitrogen inputs to the western Pacific, it has been suggested that even the open ocean has been affected. In a coral core from Dongsha Atoll, a remote coral reef ecosystem, we observe a decline in the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N of coral skeleton–bound organic matter, which signals increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of anthropogenic atmospheric N on the open ocean and its incorporation into plankton and, in turn, the atoll corals. The first clear change occurred just before 2000 CE, decades later than predicted by other work. The amplitude of change suggests that, by 2010, anthropogenic atmospheric N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion represented 20 ± 5% of the annual N input to the surface ocean in this region, which appears to be at the lower end of other estimates.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 Enhance Drought Tolerance by Modulating Root Vessels and Cell Walls in Apple
<p>Water deficit is one of the main limiting factors in apple (<i>Malus</i> × <i>domestica</i> Borkh.) cultivation. Root architecture plays an important role in the drought tolerance of plants; however, research efforts to improve drought tolerance of apple trees have focused on aboveground targets. Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the root architecture of apple trees under drought conditions. We previously observed that MdMYB88 and its paralog MdMYB124 regulate apple tree root morphology. In this study, we found that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 play important roles in maintaining root hydraulic conductivity under long-term drought conditions and therefore contribute toward adaptive drought tolerance. Further investigation revealed that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 regulate root xylem development by directly binding <i>MdVND6</i> and <i>MdMYB46</i> promoters and thus influence expression of their target genes under drought conditions. In addition, MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 were shown to regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of cellulose and lignin root cell walls in response to drought. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the importance of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 in root architecture, root xylem development, and secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in response to drought in apple trees.</p>

Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants
<p>The secondary cell walls of tracheary elements and fibers are rich in cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong> cellulose-rich secondary cell walls, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> (<i>CESA</i>) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified independently, <i>CESA</i> knockout analysis in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in CESA functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs that synthesize primary and secondary cell walls, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell wall synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of <i>ppcesa3/8</i> knockouts provided negative controls for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type <i>P. patens</i>. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion of aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose synthesis enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary wall synthesis.</p>

KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes
<p>Seed shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls seed shattering. Knockdown mutations of <i>OSH15</i> showed reduced seed-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the <i>OSH15</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that <i>OSH15</i> messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of <i>osh15 SH5-</i>D double mutants showed that <i>SH5</i> could not increase the degree of seed shattering when <i>OSH15</i> was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the seed-shattering phenotype, <i>osh15</i> mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of <i>CAD2</i>, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy seed-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in the AZ. This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of seed shattering in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with <i>CAD2</i> chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.</p>

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015.

EphA2 Expression Regulates Inflammation and Fibroproliferative Remodeling in Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic plaque formation results from chronic inflammation and fibroproliferative remodeling in the vascular wall.

In contrast, endothelial EphA2 knockdown significantly reduces monocyte firm adhesion under flow. In addition, EphA2<sup>−/−</sup>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> mice show reduced progression to advanced atherosclerotic plaques with diminished smooth muscle and collagen content. Consistent with this phenotype, EphA2 shows enhanced expression after smooth muscle transition to a synthetic phenotype, and EphA2 depletion reduces smooth muscle proliferation, mitogenic signaling, and extracellular matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion both in atherosclerotic plaques and in vascular smooth muscle cells in culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data identify a novel role for EphA2 in atherosclerosis, regulating both plaque inflammation and progression to advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

Three Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors Protect Cell Wall Integrity for Arabidopsis Immunity to <i>Botrytis</i>
<p>Infection by necrotrophs is a complex process that starts with the breakdown of the cell wall (CW) matrix initiated by CW-degrading enzymes and results in an extensive tissue maceration. Plants exploit induced defense mechanisms based on biochemical modification of the CW components to protect themselves from enzymatic degradation. The pectin matrix is the main CW target of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and pectin methylesterification status is strongly altered in response to infection. The methylesterification of pectin is controlled mainly by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), whose activity is posttranscriptionally regulated by endogenous protein inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 are identified as functional PMEIs induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. AtPMEI expression is strictly regulated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, while only AtPMEI11 expression is controlled by PME-related damage-associated molecular patterns, such as oligogalacturonides and methanol. The decrease of pectin methylesterification during infection is higher and the immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i> is compromised in <i>pmei10</i>, <i>pmei11</i>, and <i>pmei12</i> mutants with respect to the control plants. A higher stimulation of the fungal oxalic acid biosynthetic pathway also can contribute to the higher susceptibility of <i>pmei</i> mutants. The lack of <i>PMEI</i> expression does not affect hemicellulose strengthening, callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion, and the synthesis of structural defense proteins, proposed as CW-remodeling mechanisms exploited by Arabidopsis to resist CW degradation upon <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. We show that PME activity and pectin methylesterification are dynamically modulated by PMEIs during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. Our findings point to AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 as mediators of CW integrity maintenance in plant immunity.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ed in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed coat. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed coat suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed coat permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed coat suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

CNGC2 Is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the Leaf
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absorbed by roots and transported upward through the xylem to the apoplastic space of the leaf, after which it is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ed into the leaf cell. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporters CATION EXCHANGER1 (CAX1) and CAX3 sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the vacuole, but it is not known what transporter mediates the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast to the cytosol. Here, we report that Arabidopsis <i>CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL2</i> (<i>CNGC2</i>) encodes a protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel activity and is expressed in the leaf areas surrounding the free endings of minor veins, which is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> unloading from the vasculature and influx into leaf cells. Under hydroponic growth conditions, with 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both Arabidopsis <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax3</i> loss-of-function mutants grew normally. Increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 10 m<sc>m</sc> induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell death, and leaf senescence and partially suppressed the hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens in the mutants but not in the wild type. In vivo apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overaccumulation was found in the leaves of <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax</i>3 but not the wild type under the 10 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition, as monitored by Oregon Green BAPTA 488 5N, a low-affinity and membrane-impermeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe. Our results indicate that CNGC2 likely has no direct roles in leaf development or the hypersensitive response but, instead, that CNGC2 could mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into leaf cells. Finally, the in vivo extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method developed in this study provides a new tool for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in plant cells.</p>

Silencing <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i> in Maize Impedes the Incorporation of Tricin into Lignin and Increases Lignin Content
<p>Lignin is a phenolic heteropolymer that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ed in secondary-thickened cell walls, where it provides mechanical strength. A recent structural characterization of cell walls from monocot species showed that the flavone tricin is part of the native lignin polymer, where it is hypothesized to initiate lignin chains. In this study, we investigated the consequences of altered tricin levels on lignin structure and cell wall recalcitrance by phenolic profiling, nuclear magnetic resonance, and saccharification assays of the naturally silenced maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>C2-Idf</i> (<i>inhibitor diffuse</i>) mutant, defective in the <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE Colorless2</i> (<i>C2</i>) gene. We show that the <i>C2-Idf</i> mutant produces highly reduced levels of apigenin- and tricin-related flavonoids, resulting in a strongly reduced incorporation of tricin into the lignin polymer. Moreover, the lignin was enriched in β-β and β-5 units, lending support to the contention that tricin acts to initiate lignin chains and that, in the absence of tricin, more monolignol dimerization reactions occur. In addition, the <i>C2-Idf</i> mutation resulted in strikingly higher Klason lignin levels in the leaves. As a consequence, the leaves of <i>C2-Idf</i> mutants had significantly reduced saccharification efficiencies compared with those of control plants. These findings are instructive for lignin engineering strategies to improve biomass processing and biochemical production.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ed on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Photoperiod Affects the Phenotype of Mitochondrial Complex I Mutants
<p>Plant mutants for genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial complex I (CI; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the first enzyme of the respiratory chain, display various phenotypes depending on growth conditions.

In the long day (LD) condition, both <i>ndufs8.1</i> and <i>ndufs8.2</i> single mutants were indistinguishable from Columbia-0 at phenotypic and biochemical levels, whereas the <i>ndufs8.1 ndufs8.2</i> double mutant was devoid of detectable holo-CI assembly/activity, showed higher alternative oxidase content/activity, and displayed a growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation phenotype similar to that of the <i>ndufs4</i> mutant. Although growth was more affected in <i>ndufs4</i> than in <i>ndufs8.1 ndufs8.2</i> under the short day (SD) condition, both mutants displayed a similar impairment of growth acceleration after transfer to LD compared with the wild type. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics showed that overall metabolism was less responsive to the SD-to-LD transition in mutants than in the wild type. The typical LD acclimation of carbon and nitrogen assimilation as well as redox-related parameters was not observed in <i>ndufs8.1 ndufs8</i>. Similarly, NAD(H) content, which was higher in the SD condition in both mutants than in Columbia-0, did not adjust under LD. We propose that altered redox homeostasis and NAD(H) content/redox state control the phenotype of CI mutants and photoperiod acclimation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Role of Glycosyltransferases in Pollen Wall Primexine Formation and Exine Patterning
<p>The pollen cell wall is important for protection of male sperm from physical stresses and consists of an inner gametophyte-derived intine layer and a sporophyte-derived exine layer. The polymeric constituents of the robust exine are termed sporopollenin. The mechanisms by which sporopollenin is anchored onto microspores and polymerized in specific patterns are unknown, but the primexine, a transient cell wall matrix formed on the surface of microspores at the late tetrad stage, is hypothesized to play a key role. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>spongy</i> (<i>spg</i>) and <i>uneven pattern of exine</i> (<i>upex</i>) mutants exhibit defective and irregular exine patterns. <i>SPG2</i> (synonymous with <i>IRREGULAR XYLEM9-LIKE</i> [<i>IRX9L</i>]) encodes a family GT43 glycosyltransferase involved in xylan backbone biosynthesis, while <i>UPEX1</i> encodes a family GT31 glycosyltransferase likely involved in galactosylation of arabinogalactan proteins. Imaging of developing <i>irx9l</i> microspores showed that the earliest detectable defect was in primexine formation. Furthermore, wild-type microspores contained primexine-localized epitopes indicative of the presence of xylan, but these were absent in <i>irx9l</i>. These data, together with the <i>spg</i> phenotype of a mutant in <i>IRX14L</i>, which also plays a role in xylan backbone elongation, indicate the presence of xylan in pollen wall primexine, which plays a role in exine patterning on the microspore surface. We observed an aberrant primexine and irregular patterns of incipient sporopollenin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in <i>upex1</i>, suggesting that primexine-localized arabinogalactan proteins could play roles in sporopollenin adhesion and patterning early in microspore wall development. Our data provide new insights into the biochemical and functional properties of the primexine component of the microspore cell wall.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion and remodeling.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Oxidation of P700 in Photosystem I Is Essential for the Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>The photoinhibition of photosystem I (PSI) is lethal to oxygenic phototrophs. Nevertheless, it is unclear how photodamage occurs or how oxygenic phototrophs prevent it. Here, we provide evidence that keeping P700 (the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI) oxidized protects PSI. Previous studies have suggested that PSI photoinhibition does not occur in the two model cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942, when photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation was suppressed under low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure even in mutants deficient in flavodiiron protein (FLV), which mediates alternative electron flow. The lack of FLV in <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 (S. 7002), however, is linked directly to reduced growth and PSI photodamage under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions. Unlike <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC 7942, S. 7002 reduced P700 during CO<sub>2</sub>-limited illumination in the absence of FLV, resulting in decreases in both PSI and photosynthetic activities. Even at normal air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the growth of S. 7002 mutant was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed relative to that of the wild type. Therefore, P700 oxidation is essential for protecting PSI against photoinhibition. Here, we present various strategies to alleviate PSI photoinhibition in cyanobacteria.</p>

Secretory COPII Protein SEC31B Is Required for Pollen Wall Development
<p>The pollen wall protects pollen grains from abiotic and biotic stresses. During pollen wall development, tapetal cells play a vital role by secreting proteins, signals, and pollen wall material to ensure microspore development. But the regulatory mechanism underlying the secretory pathway of the tapetum is largely unknown. Here, we characterize the essential role of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COPII protein SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) in pollen wall development and the secretory activity of tapetal cells. The sporophyte-controlled <i>atsec31b</i> mutant exhibits severe pollen and seed abortion. Transmission electron microscopy observation indicates that pollen exine formation in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant is disrupted significantly. AtSEC31B is a functional COPII protein revealed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site localization, interaction with AtSEC13A, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant. A genetic tapetum-specific rescue assay indicates that AtSEC31B functions primarily in the tapetum. Moreover, deletion of AtSEC31B interrupted the formation of the ER-derived tapetosome and altered the location of the ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER9 protein in the tapetum. Therefore, this work demonstrates that AtSEC31B plays a vital role in pollen wall development by regulating the secretory pathway of the tapetal cells.</p>

TWS1, a Novel Small Protein, Regulates Various Aspects of Seed and Plant Development
<p>Small proteins have long been overlooked due to their poor annotation and the experimental challenges they pose. However, in recent years, their role in various processes has started to emerge, opening new research avenues. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of two allelic mutants, <i>twisted seed1-1</i> (<i>tws1-1</i>) and <i>tws1-2</i>, which exhibit an array of developmental and biochemical phenotypes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds. We have identified <i>AT5G01075</i> as the subtending gene encoding a small protein of 81 amino acids localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. <i>TWS1</i> is strongly expressed in seeds, where it regulates both embryo development and accumulation of storage compounds. <i>TWS1</i> loss-of-function seeds exhibit increased starch, sucrose, and protein accumulation at the detriment of fatty acids. <i>TWS1</i> is also expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues, where it is responsible for proper epidermal cell morphology and overall plant growth. At the cellular level, <i>TWS1</i> is responsible for cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion on epidermal cells and organization of the endomembrane system. Finally, we show that <i>TWS1</i> is a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis, and it is specifically conserved among angiosperms.</p>

NAD Acts as an Integral Regulator of Multiple Defense Layers
<p>Pyridine nucleotides, such as NAD, are crucial redox carriers and have emerged as important signaling molecules in stress responses. Previously, we have demonstrated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that the inducible NAD-overproducing <i>nadC</i> lines are more resistant to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst-AvrRpm1</i>), which was associated with salicylic acid-dependent defense. Here, we have further characterized the NAD-dependent immune response in Arabidopsis. Quinolinate-induced stimulation of intracellular NAD in transgenic <i>nadC</i> plants enhanced resistance against a diverse range of (a)virulent pathogens, including <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>, <i>Dickeya dadantii</i>, and <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Characterization of the redox status demonstrated that elevated NAD levels induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the expression of redox marker genes of the cytosol and mitochondrion. Using pharmacological and reverse genetics approaches, we show that NAD-induced ROS production functions independently of NADPH oxidase activity and light metabolism but depends on mitochondrial respiration, which was increased at higher NAD. We further demonstrate that NAD primes pathogen-induced callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion and cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals that NAD simultaneously induces different defense hormones and that the NAD-induced metabolic profiles are similar to those of defense-expressing plants after treatment with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. We thus conclude that NAD triggers metabolic profiles rather similar to that of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and discuss how signaling cross talk between defense hormones, ROS, and NAD explains the observed resistance to pathogens.</p>

ZRF1 Chromatin Regulators Have Polycomb Silencing and Independent Roles in Development
<p>Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is read to exert downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both <i>AtZRF1a</i> and <i>AtZRF1b</i> in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, abnormal meristem activity, abnormal flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis defects. Some of these defects overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-defective mutants <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> and <i>atring1a atring1b</i>, but others are specific to <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i>. In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in <i>atring1a atring1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i>. Finally, we show that in both <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> seedlings, the seed developmental genes <i>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3</i>, <i>CRUCIFERIN3</i>, and <i>CHOTTO1</i> are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Collectively, our results indicate that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> play both PRC1-related and PRC1-unrelated functions in regulating plant growth and development and that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> promote H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion in gene suppression. Our work provides novel insight into the mechanisms of function of this family of evolutionarily conserved chromatin regulators.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Illuminating the Base of the Annelid Tree Using Transcriptomics
<p>Annelida is one of three animal groups possessing segmentation and is central in considerations about the evolution of different character traits. It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750–170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our reconstruction of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong> feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and filter feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or grooved palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia bearing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.</p>

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p>Female insects of diverse orders bore into substrates to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong> their eggs. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the forces required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard substrates.</p>

Ontogenetic expression of metabolic genes and microRNAs in rainbow trout alevins during the transition from the endogenous to the exogenous feeding period
<p>As oviparous fish, rainbow trout change their nutritional strategy during ontogenesis. This change is divided into the exclusive utilization of yolk-sac reserves (endogenous feeding), the concurrent utilization of yolk reserves and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The change in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological changes, including the development of adipose tissue as an energy storage site, and continuous muscle development to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic changes between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow trout alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of marker genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or maintenance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (<i>g6pca</i> and <i>g6pcb</i>) and lipolytic gene expression (<i>cpt1a</i> and <i>cpt1b</i>) decreased, while that of <i>gk</i>, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the utilization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a utilization of exogenous feeds <i>via</i> the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the utilization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of <i>omy-miRNA-143</i>, a homologue of the mammalian marker of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene <i>abhd5</i>, a factor in triglyceride hydrolysis, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deposit</span></strong>ion. Muscle-specific <i>omy-miRNA-1/133</i> and <i>myod1</i> expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with muscle hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging.</p>

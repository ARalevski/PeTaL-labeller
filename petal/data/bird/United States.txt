Geographic Variation in Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Medicare and Veterans Affairs Populations
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it is historically underused. We sought to evaluate variation in cardiac rehabilitation participation across the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From administrative data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system and a 5% Medicare sample, we used Inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to identify patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery from 2007 to 2011. After excluding patients who died in ≤30 days of hospitalization, we calculated the percentage of patients who participated in ≥1 outpatient visits for cardiac rehabilitation during the 12 months after hospitalization. We estimated adjusted and standardized rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation by state using hierarchical logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, participation in cardiac rehabilitation was 16.3% (23 403/143 756) in Medicare and 10.3% (9123/88 826) in VA. However, participation rates varied widely across states, ranging from 3.2% to 41.8% in Medicare and 1.2% to 47.6% in VA. Similar regional variation was observed in both populations. Patients in the West North Central region (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) had the highest participation, whereas those in the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) had the lowest participation in both Medicare (33.7% versus 10.6%) and VA (16.6% versus 5.1%) populations. Significant hospital-level variation was also present, with participation ranging from 3% to 75% in Medicare and 1% to 43% in VA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation participation re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>s low overall in both Medicare and VA populations. However, remarkably similar regional variation exists, with some regions and hospitals achieving high rates of participation in both populations. This provides an opportunity to identify best practices from higher performing hospitals and regions that could be used to improve cardiac rehabilitation participation in lower performing hospitals and regions.</p></sec>

The Global Cardiovascular Risk Transition
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>It is commonly assumed that cardiovascular disease risk factors are associated with affluence and Westernization. We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, and serum total cholesterol with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income, Western diet, and, for BMI, urbanization in 1980 and 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Country-level risk factor estimates for 199 countries between 1980 and 2008 were from a previous systematic analysis of population-based data. We analyzed the associations between risk factors and per capita <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income, a measure of Western diet, and, for BMI, the percentage of the population living in urban areas. In 1980, there was a positive association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and population mean BMI, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol. By 2008, the slope of the association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and systolic blood pressure became negative for women and zero for men. Total cholesterol was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and Western diet in both 1980 and 2008. In 1980, BMI rose with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and then flattened at ≈Int$7000; by 2008, the relationship resembled an inverted U for women, peaking at middle-income levels. BMI had a positive relationship with the percentage of urban population in both 1980 and 2008. Fasting plasma glucose had weaker associations with these country macro characteristics, but it was positively associated with BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The changing associations of metabolic risk factors with macroeconomic variables indicate that there will be a global pandemic of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, together with high blood pressure in low-income countries, unless effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are implemented.</p></sec>

First opioid settlement lets researchers think big
<p>A fledgling, small-scale approach to dealing with the state's opioid crisis paid off big last week for Oklahoma State University (OSU) when it became the surprise beneficiary of a $270 million legal settlement with Purdue Pharma. It's the first agreement in some 1700 pending cases around the United States against Purdue, which makes the painkiller OxyContin, and other manufacturers of prescription opioids. On 26 March the state of Oklahoma agreed to drop its suit alleging deceptive marketing practices by Purdue in exchange for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Center for Addiction Studies and Treatment at OSU's medical complex in Tulsa. Purdue and the Sackler family, which owns the Stamford, Connecticut–based company, will provide a $177 million endowment for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al center, along with $20 million over 5 years for naloxone and other drugs to treat opioid addiction. The state is continuing its suit against several other companies, with opening arguments set for 28 May.</p>

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher blood pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of blood pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete blood pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health and Nutrition Exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> Survey, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. Usual 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, and their ratio) was estimated from ≤2 collections on nonconsecutive days, adjusting for day-to-day variability in excretion. Outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average blood pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) blood pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in sodium-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with systolic blood pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68). Hypertension was linearly associated with progressively higher sodium and lower potassium excretion; in comparison with the lowest quartile of excretion, the adjusted odds of hypertension for the highest quartile was 4.22 (95% CI, 1.36–13.15) for sodium, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17–0.87) for potassium (<i>P</i><0.01 for trends).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These cross-sectional results show a strong dose-response association between urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure, and an inverse association between urinary potassium excretion and blood pressure, in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally representative sample of US adults.</p></sec>

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was analyzed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch ratio >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL). Patients meeting target mismatch criteria were analyzed as a subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from the pooled group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 146 pooled patients, 71 received alteplase and 75 received tenecteplase. Tenecteplase-treated patients had greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: tenecteplase, 7; alteplase, 2; <i>P</i>=0.018) and less parenchymal hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; <i>P</i>=0.02).

Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico
<p>In August 2017, the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic zone was declared to be the largest ever measured. It has been estimated that a 60% decrease in watershed nitrogen (N) loading may be necessary to adequately reduce eutrophication in the Gulf. However, to date there has been no rigorous assessment of the effect of N legacies on achieving water quality goals. In this study, we show that even if agricultural N use became 100% efficient, it would take decades to meet target N loads due to legacy N within the Mississippi River basin. Our results suggest that both long-term commitment and large-scale changes in agricultural management practices will be necessary to decrease Mississippi N loads and to meet current goals for reducing the size of the Gulf hypoxic zone.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities

Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>).

Superhuman AI for heads-up no-limit poker: Libratus beats top professionals

Despite artificial intelligence (AI) successes in perfect-information games, the private information and massive game tree have made no-limit poker difficult to tackle. We present Libratus, an AI that, in a 120,000-hand competition, defeated four top human specialist professionals in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em, the leading benchmark and long-standing challenge problem in imperfect-information game solving. Our game-theoretic approach features application-independent techniques: an algorithm for computing a blueprint for the overall strategy, an algorithm that fleshes out the details of the strategy for subgames that are reached during play, and a self-improver algorithm that fixes potential weaknesses that opponents have identified in the blueprint strategy.</p>

Brain implant trials spur ethical discussions
<p>When a clinical trial of a pharmaceutical fails, participants usually move on by ceasing to take the drug. But it’s not that simple for some people who took part in a trial of a bold, experimental treatment for people with severe depression. The BROADEN trial, which implanted metal electrodes deep in the brain in a region called area 25, failed early on to show a statistically significant effect on depression and was halted after just 90 participants were treated. Yet 44 of those patients want to keep their implants. Last month, researchers at a meeting at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, discussed the ethical issues that such scenarios raise, such as who is responsible for overseeing—and paying for—long-term care when participants want to keep their infants?</p>

NIH quietly shelves gun research program
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) wasn't coy when it responded to a call from then-President Barack Obama for government agencies to do firearm research. The president's plea came on the heels of a gunman's murder of 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012. Nine months later, the huge biomedical research agency issued three notices encouraging scientists to apply to do research on violence and its prevention, particularly firearm research. NIH has since spent $18 million funding 22 projects. But the agency has now let the gun research program lapse, <i>Science</i> has learned. It stopped taking applications in January, despite a written plea from a score of scientists, and the last new awards are now being launched. Last week, an agency spokesperson said that renewal of the program "is still under consideration," but gave no timeline for when the agency would reach a decision.</p>

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity
<p>Establishing what controls the timing of earthquakes is fundamental to understanding the nature of the earthquake cycle and critical to determining time-dependent earthquake hazard. Seasonal loading provides a natural laboratory to explore the crustal response to a quantifiable transient force. In California, water storage deforms the crust as snow and water accumulates during the wet winter months. We used 9 years of global positioning system (GPS) vertical deformation time series to constrain models of monthly hydrospheric loading and the resulting stress changes on fault planes of small earthquakes. The seasonal loading analysis reveals earthquakes occurring more frequently during stress conditions that favor earthquake rupture. We infer that California seismicity rates are modestly modulated by natural hydrological loading cycles.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.</p>

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their coat and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and coat is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone auxin, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing auxin canalization and export from axillary buds into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> stem. In this theory, auxin flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of auxin from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in auxin transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in auxin efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The auxin transport inhibitor 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the auxin perception inhibitor <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked auxin efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting auxin flow in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate auxin-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These inhibitors had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. Inhibitory effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of auxin canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly occupied by homogeneous polygonal starch from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) starches have been identified in some rice mutants. How these heterogeneous starches form re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>s unknown. A high-amylose rice line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i>starch branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> contains four heterogeneous starches: polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch; these starches are regionally distributed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous starches in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of starch. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent regular changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous starches were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly due to the spatial distribution of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in starch might remove steric hindrance and provide extra space for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

A Novel N-Methyltransferase in Arabidopsis Appears to Feed a Conserved Pathway for Nicotinate Detoxification among Land Plants and Is Associated with Lignin Biosynthesis
<p>The Preiss-Handler pathway, which salvages nicotinate (NA) for NAD synthesis, is an indispensable biochemical pathway in land plants. Various NA conjugations (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in plants. Previously, we demonstrated that NA <i>O</i>-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in plants. In this study, we first found that <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in land plants. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NA<i>N</i>MT), which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly responsible for <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate formation, from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in plants. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA <i>N</i>-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene in the course of land plant evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in <i>S</i>-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NA<i>N</i>MT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification conferred by NA<i>N</i>MT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in land plants.</p>

A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ed to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-based VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-based VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-based VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-based VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-based VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.</p>

Three Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors Protect Cell Wall Integrity for Arabidopsis Immunity to <i>Botrytis</i>
<p>Infection by necrotrophs is a complex process that starts with the breakdown of the cell wall (CW) matrix initiated by CW-degrading enzymes and results in an extensive tissue maceration. Plants exploit induced defense mechanisms based on biochemical modification of the CW components to protect themselves from enzymatic degradation. The pectin matrix is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> CW target of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and pectin methylesterification status is strongly altered in response to infection. The methylesterification of pectin is controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), whose activity is posttranscriptionally regulated by endogenous protein inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 are identified as functional PMEIs induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. AtPMEI expression is strictly regulated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, while only AtPMEI11 expression is controlled by PME-related damage-associated molecular patterns, such as oligogalacturonides and methanol. The decrease of pectin methylesterification during infection is higher and the immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i> is compromised in <i>pmei10</i>, <i>pmei11</i>, and <i>pmei12</i> mutants with respect to the control plants. A higher stimulation of the fungal oxalic acid biosynthetic pathway also can contribute to the higher susceptibility of <i>pmei</i> mutants. The lack of <i>PMEI</i> expression does not affect hemicellulose strengthening, callose deposition, and the synthesis of structural defense proteins, proposed as CW-remodeling mechanisms exploited by Arabidopsis to resist CW degradation upon <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. We show that PME activity and pectin methylesterification are dynamically modulated by PMEIs during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. Our findings point to AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 as mediators of CW integrity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>tenance in plant immunity.</p>

The Thiamine Biosynthesis Gene <i>THI1</i> Promotes Nodule Growth and Seed Maturation
<p>Thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for living organisms. Unlike animals, plants can synthesize thiamine. In <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, the expression of two thiamine biosynthesis genes, <i>THI1</i> and <i>THIC</i>, was enhanced by inoculation with rhizobia but not by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. <i>THIC</i> and <i>THI2</i> (a <i>THI1</i> paralog) were expressed in uninoculated leaves. <i>THI2</i>-knockdown plants and the transposon insertion mutant <i>thiC</i> had chlorotic leaves. This typical phenotype of thiamine deficiency was rescued by an exogenous supply of thiamine. In wild-type plants, <i>THI1</i> was expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly in roots and nodules, and the <i>thi1</i> mutant had green leaves even in the absence of exogenous thiamine. <i>THI1</i> was highly expressed in actively dividing cells of nodule primordia. The <i>thi1</i> mutant had small nodules, and this phenotype was rescued by exogenous thiamine and by <i>THI1</i> complementation. Exogenous thiamine increased nodule diameter, but the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization was unaffected in the <i>thi1</i> mutant or by exogenous thiamine. Expression of symbiotic marker genes was induced normally, implying that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly nodule growth was delayed in the <i>thi1</i> mutant. Furthermore, this mutant formed many immature seeds with reduced seed weight. These results indicate that thiamine biosynthesis mediated by THI1 enhances nodule enlargement and is required for seed development in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

Developmental Changes in Scots Pine Transcriptome during Heartwood Formation
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) wood is desired in woodworking industries due to its favorable timber characteristics and natural durability that is contributed by heartwood extractives. It has been discussed whether the Scots pine heartwood extractives (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly stilbenes and resin acids) are synthesized in the cells of the transition zone between sapwood and heartwood, or if they are transported from the sapwood. Timing of heartwood formation during the yearly cycle has also not been unambiguously defined. We measured steady-state mRNA levels in Scots pine transition zone and sapwood using RNA sequencing. Year-round expression profiles of selected transcripts were further investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. Differentially accumulating transcripts suggest that, of the Scots pine heartwood extractives, stilbenes are synthesized in situ in the transition zone and gain their carbon-skeletons from Suc and triglycerides. Resin acids, on the other hand, are synthesized early in the spring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly in the sapwood, meaning that they must be transported to the heartwood transition zone. Heartwood formation is marked by programmed cell death that occurs during the summer months in the transition zone.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Unusual Diversity of Myoglobin Genes in the Lungfish
<p>Myoglobin is a respiratory protein that serves as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> function is to deliver and store O<sub>2</sub> in the heart and skeletal muscles, but myoglobin is also instrumental in homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Almost every vertebrate harbors a single myoglobin gene; only some cyprinid fishes have two recently duplicated myoglobin genes. Here we show that the West African lungfish <i>Protopterus annectens</i> has at least seven distinct myoglobin genes (<i>PanMb1–7</i>), which diverged early in the evolution of lungfish and showed an enhanced evolutionary rate. These myoglobins are lungfish specific, and no other globin gene was found amplified. The myoglobins are differentially expressed in various lungfish tissues, and the brain is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> site of myoglobin expression. The typical myoglobin-containing tissues, the skeletal muscle and the heart, have much lower myoglobin mRNA levels. Muscle and heart express distinct myoglobins (<i>PanMb1</i> and <i>PanMb3</i>, respectively). In cell culture, lungfish myoglobins improved cellular survival under hypoxia albeit with different efficiencies and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species. Only <i>Mb2</i> and <i>Mb6</i> enhanced the energy status of the cells. The unexpected diversity of myoglobin hints to a functional diversification of this gene: some myoglobins may have adapted to the O<sub>2</sub> requirements of the specific tissue and help the lungfish to survive hypoxic periods; other myoglobins may have taken over the roles of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, which appear to be missing in the West African lungfish.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-effectiveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-effectiveness   between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case)   and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted   life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio   (ICER) were calculated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates   of revision were derived from the National Joint Registry for England,   Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic   sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a   $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PFA was more expensive ($49 811 <i>versus</i> $46 632)   but more effective (14.3 QALYs <i>versus</i> 13.3 QALYs)   over a lifetime horizon. The ICER associated with the additional   effectiveness of PFA was $3097. The model was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ing cost-effective when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits   at no increased cost when annual rates of revision decreased by   24.5%. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recent improvements in rates of implant of survival have made   PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger   patients, delaying TKA until implant failure or tibiofemoral OA   progression. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal   benefit for PFA to be cost-effective compared with TKA and identified survivorship   targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more effective.   These benchmarks might be used to assess clinical outcomes of PFA   from an economic standpoint within the United States healthcare   system.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1028–36.</p></sec>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> low in these patients. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health and Nutrition Exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Second Arterial Versus Venous Conduits for Multivessel Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in California
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Whether a second arterial conduit improves outcomes after multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>s unclear. Consequently, arterial conduits other than the left internal thoracic artery are seldom used in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a state-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>tained clinical registry including all 126 nonfederal hospitals in California, we compared all-cause mortality and rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and sternal wound infection between propensity score–matched cohorts who underwent primary, isolated multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting with the left internal thoracic artery, and who received a second arterial conduit (right internal thoracic artery or radial artery, n=5866) or a venous conduit (n=53 566) between 2006 and 2011. Propensity score matching using 34 preoperative characteristics yielded 5813 matched sets. A subgroup analysis compared outcomes between propensity score–matched recipients of a right internal thoracic artery (n=1576) or a radial artery (n=4290).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Second arterial conduit use decreased from 10.7% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2011 (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, receipt of a second arterial conduit was associated with significantly lower mortality (13.1% versus 10.6% at 7 years; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.87), and lower risks of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.87) and repeat revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76–0.88). In comparison with radial artery grafts, right internal thoracic artery grafts were associated with similar mortality rates (right internal thoracic artery 10.3% versus radial artery 10.7% at 7 years; hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.89–1.37) and individual risks of cardiovascular events, but the risk of sternal wound infection was increased (risk difference, 1.07%; 95% CI, 0.15–2.07).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Second arterial conduit use in California is low and declining, but arterial grafts were associated with significantly lower mortality and fewer cardiovascular events. A right internal thoracic artery graft offered no benefit over that of a radial artery, but did increase risk of sternal wound infection. These findings suggest surgeons should consider lowering their threshold for using arterial grafts, and the radial artery may be the preferred second conduit.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in sample adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31). Interaction terms for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally representative sample, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates.

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ed significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05).

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart failure syndrome precipitated by intense emotional stress. Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-term clinical and functional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction.

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>s significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term survival is not well understood. We hypothesized that an optimal interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P survival exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set was used. Transplant-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The risk-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors. In patients with multiple risk factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the optimal timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few risk factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS. Early S2P did not rescue patients with greater risk factor burdens. Instead, referral for heart transplantation may offer their best chance at long-term survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prevalence, Incidence, and Mortality of Stroke in China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>China bears the biggest stroke burden in the world. However, little is known about the current prevalence, incidence, and mortality of stroke at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al level, and the trend in the past 30 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 2013, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally representative door-to-door survey was conducted in 155 urban and rural centers in 31 provinces in China, totaling 480 687 adults aged ≥20 years. All stroke survivors were considered as prevalent stroke cases at the prevalent time (August 31, 2013). First-ever strokes that occurred during 1 year preceding the survey point-prevalent time were considered as incident cases. According to computed tomography/MRI/autopsy findings, strokes were categorized into ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke of undetermined type.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 480 687 participants, 7672 were diagnosed with a prevalent stroke (1596.0/100 000 people) and 1643 with incident strokes (345.1/100 000 person-years). The age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates were 1114.8/100 000 people, 246.8 and 114.8/100 000 person-years, respectively. Pathological type of stroke was documented by computed tomography/MRI brain scanning in 90% of prevalent and 83% of incident stroke cases. Among incident and prevalent strokes, ischemic stroke constituted 69.6% and 77.8%, intracerebral hemorrhage 23.8% and 15.8%, subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.4% and 4.4%, and undetermined type 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Age-specific stroke prevalence in men aged ≥40 years was significantly greater than the prevalence in women (<i>P</i><0.001). The most prevalent risk factors among stroke survivors were hypertension (88%), smoking (48%), and alcohol use (44%). Stroke prevalence estimates in 2013 were statistically greater than those reported in China 3 decades ago, especially among rural residents (<i>P</i>=0.017). The highest annual incidence and mortality of stroke was in Northeast (365 and 159/100 000 person-years), then Central areas (326 and 154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest incidence was in Southwest China (154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest mortality was in South China (65/100 000 person-years) (<i>P</i><0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Stroke burden in China has increased over the past 30 years, and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>s particularly high in rural areas.

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac death. We calculated the risk estimates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> outcomes according to a fixed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher risk of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher risk at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly by an increased risk of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the risk of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year.

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health and Nutrition Exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> Survey and linked with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year. A consequence of this treatment strategy, however, could be an increase in serious adverse events.</p></sec>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-effective. AP was even more cost-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk. These findings support the cost-effectiveness of guidelines recommending AP use in high-risk individuals.</p></sec>

Closing the Gap in Hypertension Control Between Younger and Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Committee goal blood pressure for all adults was <140/<90 mm Hg or lower from 1984 to 2013. Adults aged ≥60 years (older) have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong>ly isolated systolic hypertension, with major trials attaining systolic blood pressure <150 but not <140 mm Hg. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> objective was to assess changes in hypertension control to <140/<90 mm Hg in younger (aged <60 years) and older adults and <150/<90 mm Hg in the latter.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health and Nutrition Exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> Surveys (NHANES) 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004, and 2005 to 2010 were analyzed in adults aged ≥18 years. From 1988 to 1994 to 2005 to 2010, hypertension control to <140/<90 mm Hg improved in older (31.6% to 53.1%; <i>P</i><0.001) and younger (45.7% to 55.9%; <i>P</i><0.001) patients. The age gap in control declined from 14.1% (<i>P</i><0.01) in 1988 to 1994 to 2.8% (<i>P</i>=0.13) in 2005 to 2010. Better hypertension control reflected increased percentages of older (55.6% to 77.5%) and younger (34.6% to 54.7%) patients on treatment and treated older (45.7% to 64.9%) and younger (56.8% to 73.4%) patients controlled (all <i>P</i><0.001). Control to <150/<90 mm Hg rose from 48.8% to 69.9% in older adults. Antihypertensive medication number and percentages on ≥3 medications increased in both age groups but increased more in older patients (<i>P</i><0.01). Blood pressure control was higher in both age groups with ≥2 healthcare visits per year and on statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The age gap in hypertension control to <140/<90 mm Hg was virtually eliminated in 2005 to 2010 as clinicians intensified therapy, especially in older patients in whom isolated systolic hypertension predominates, controlling 70% to <150/<90 mm Hg. More frequent healthcare visits and the use of statin therapy may improve hypertension control in all adults.</p></sec>

Repeat Coronary Revascularization After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on rates and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 years from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 years). After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-year survival rate was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 years after surgery, respectively. The rates of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization rate, whereas advanced age, left <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">main</span></strong> disease, and smoking were associated with a lower rate. There was approximately a 2-fold variation in repeat revascularization rates across centers at 1 year (interquartile range 1.7–3.6%) and 5 years (interquartile range 6.7–12.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Repeat revascularization is performed infrequently among older patients who undergo CABG; however, these rates vary substantially by patient subgroups and among providers.</p></sec>

Long-Chain Monounsaturated Fatty Acids and Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in 2 Prospective Cohorts
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Decades-old animal experiments suggested that dietary long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFAs) caused cardiotoxicity, leading, for example, development of Canola oil (Canadian oil low in erucic acid) from rapeseed. However, potential cardiotoxicity in humans and contemporary dietary sources of LCMUFAs are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We prospectively investigated the associations of plasma phospholipid LCMUFAs (20:1, 22:1, and 24:1), assessed as objective biomarkers of exposure, with incidence congestive heart failure in 2 independent cohorts: 3694 older adults (mean age, 75.2±5.2 years) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 1992–2006) and 3577 middle-aged adults (mean age, 54.1±5.8 years) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Minnesota subcohort (ARIC; 1987–2008). We further examined dietary correlates of circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC and US dietary sources of LCMUFAs in the 2003–2010 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health and Nutrition Exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> Survey (NHANES). In CHS, 997 congestive heart failure events occurred during 39 238 person-years; in ARIC, 330 events congestive heart failure events occurred during 64 438 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, higher levels of 22:1 and 24:1 were positively associated with greater incident congestive heart failure in both CHS and ARIC; hazard ratios were 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.76) and 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.23) for highest versus lowest quintiles of 22:1, respectively, and 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23–2.50) and 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.22–3.03) for 24:1, respectively (<i>P</i> for trend ≤0.03 each). A variety of foods were related to circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC, consistent with food sources of LCMUFAs in NHANES, including fish, poultry, meats, whole grains, and mustard.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Higher circulating levels of 22:1 and 24:1, with apparently diverse dietary sources, were associated with incident congestive heart failure in 2 independent cohorts, suggesting possible cardiotoxicity of LCMUFAs in humans.</p></sec>

Effect of Race and Ethnicity on Outcomes With Drug-Eluting and Bare Metal Stents
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients have been underrepresented in percutaneous coronary intervention clinical trials; therefore, there are limited data available on outcomes for these race/ethnicity groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined outcomes in 423 965 patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry database linked to Medicare claims for follow-up. Within each race/ethnicity group, we examined trends in drug-eluting stent (DES) use, 30-month outcomes, and relative outcomes of DES versus bare metal stents. Overall, 390 351 white, 20 191 black, 9342 Hispanic, and 4171 Asian patients > 65 years of age underwent stent implantation from 2004 through 2008 at 940 National Cardiovascular Data Registry participating sites. Trends in adoption of DES were similar across all groups. Relative to whites, black and Hispanic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention had higher long-term risks of death and myocardial infarction (blacks: hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–1.32; Hispanics: hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.21). Long-term outcomes were similar in Asians and whites (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.08). Use of DES was associated with better 30-month survival and lower myocardial infarction rates compared with the use of bare metal stents among all race/ethnicity groups except Hispanics, who had similar outcomes with DES or bare metal stents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Black and Hispanic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention had worse long-term outcomes relative to white and Asian patients. Compared with bare metal stent use, DES use was generally associated with superior long-term outcomes in all racial and ethnic groups, although these differences were not statistically significant in Hispanic patients.</p></sec>

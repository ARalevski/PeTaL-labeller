Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development to an adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change in Arabidopsis.</p>

The impact of long-term water stress on tree architecture and production is related to changes in transitions between vegetative and reproductive growth in the ‘Granny Smith’ apple cultivar
<p>Water stress (WS) generates a number of physiological and morphological responses in plants that depend on the intensity and duration of stress as well as the plant species and development stage. In perennial plants, WS may affect plant development through cumulative effects that modify plant functions, architecture and production over time. Plant architecture depends on the fate of the terminal and axillary buds that can give rise, in the particular case of apple, to reproductive or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth units (GUs) of different lengths. In this study, the impact of long-term WS (7 years) on the fate of terminal and axillary buds was investigated in relation to flowering occurrence and production pattern (biennial vs regular) in the ‘Granny Smith’ cultivar. It was observed that WS decreased the total number of GUs per branch, regardless of their type. Conversely, WS did not modify the timing of the two successive developmental phases characterized by the production of long and medium GUs and an alternation of floral GUs over time, respectively. The analysis of GU successions over time using a variable-order Markov chain that included both the effects of the predecessor and water treatment revealed that WS reduced the transition towards long and medium GUs and increased the transition toward floral, short and dead GUs. WS also slightly increased the proportion of axillary floral GUs. The higher relative frequency of floral GUs compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative ones reduced the tendency to biennial bearing under WS. The accelerated ontogenetic trend observed under WS suggests lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth that could, in turn, be beneficial to floral induction and fruit set.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative transition by inhibiting expression of seed-specific genes during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in seedlings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Evolution of alluvial mudrock forced by early land plants
<p>Mudrocks are a primary archive of Earth’s history from the Archean eon to recent times, and their source-to-sink production and deposition play a central role in long-term ocean chemistry and climate regulation. Using original and published stratigraphic data from all 704 of Earth’s known alluvial formations from the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) to the Carboniferous period (0.3 billion years ago), we prove contentions of an upsurge in the proportion of mud retained on land coeval with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation evolution. We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that alluvium deposited after land plant evolution contains a proportion of mudrock that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in alluvium from the preceding 90% of Earth’s history. We attribute this shift to the ways in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation revolutionized mud production and sediment flux from continental interiors.</p>

Satellites reveal contrasting responses of regional climate to the widespread greening of Earth
<p>Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation cover associated with the observed greening may affect several biophysical processes, whose net effects on climate are unclear. We analyzed remotely sensed dynamics in leaf area index (LAI) and energy fluxes in order to explore the associated variation in local climate. We show that the increasing trend in LAI contributed to the warming of boreal zones through a reduction of surface albedo and to an evaporation-driven cooling in arid regions. The interplay between LAI and surface biophysics is amplified up to five times under extreme warm-dry and cold-wet years. Altogether, these signals reveal that the recent dynamics in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation have had relevant biophysical impacts on the local climates and should be considered in the design of local mitigation and adaptation plans.</p>

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are known as flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

A 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase Mediates the Biosynthesis of Glucoraphasatin in Radish
<p>Glucosinolates (GSLs) are secondary metabolites whose degradation products confer intrinsic flavors and aromas to Brassicaceae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ables. Several structures of GSLs are known in the Brassicaceae, and the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory networks have been elucidated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). GSLs are precursors of chemical defense substances against herbivorous pests. Specific GSLs can act as feeding blockers or stimulants, depending on the pest species. Natural selection has led to diversity in the GSL composition even within individual species. However, in radish (<i>Raphanus sativus</i>), glucoraphasatin (4-methylthio-3-butenyl glucosinolate) accounts for more than 90% of the total GSLs, and little compositional variation is observed. Because glucoraphasatin is not contained in other members of the Brassicaceae, like Arabidopsis and cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i>), the biosynthetic pathways for glucoraphasatin remain unclear. In this report, we identified and characterized a gene encoding GLUCORAPHASATIN SYNTHASE 1 (GRS1) by genetic mapping using a mutant that genetically lacks glucoraphasatin. Transgenic Arabidopsis, which overexpressed <i>GRS1</i> cDNA, accumulated glucoraphasatin in the leaves. <i>GRS1</i> encodes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, and it is abundantly expressed in the leaf. To further investigate the biosynthesis and transportation of GSLs in radish, we grafted a <i>grs1</i> plant onto a wild-type plant. The grafting experiment revealed a leaf-to-root long-distance glucoraphasatin transport system in radish and showed that the composition of GSLs differed among the organs. Based on these observations, we propose a characteristic biosynthesis pathway for glucoraphasatin in radish. Our results should be useful in metabolite engineering for breeding of high-value <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ables.</p>

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels. Here, we identified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades linear and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both linear and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript levels increased during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid reduction in mtDNA. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the reduction in mtDNA levels in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed reduction in pollen mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>PIRL6</i> Is Essential for Male and Female Gametogenesis and Is Regulated by Alternative Splicing
<p>Plant intracellular Ras-group leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins (PIRLs) are related to Ras-interacting animal LRR proteins that participate in developmental cell signaling. Systematic knockout analysis has implicated some members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>PIRL</i> family in pollen development. However, for <i>PIRL6</i>, no bona fide knockout alleles have been recovered, suggesting that it may have an essential function in both male and female gametophytes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated <i>PIRL6</i> expression and induced knockdown by RNA interference. Knockdown triggered defects in gametogenesis, resulting in abnormal pollen and early developmental arrest in the embryo sac. Consistent with this, <i>PIRL6</i> was expressed in gametophytes: functional transcripts were detected in wild-type flowers but not in <i>sporocyteless</i> (<i>spl</i>) mutant flowers, which do not produce gametophytes. A genomic PIRL6-GFP fusion construct confirmed expression in both pollen and the embryo sac. Interestingly, <i>PIRL6</i> is part of a convergent overlapping gene pair, a scenario associated with an increased likelihood of alternative splicing. We detected multiple alternative <i>PIRL6</i> mRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative organs and <i>spl</i> mutant flowers, tissues that lacked the functionally spliced transcript. cDNA sequencing revealed that all contained intron sequences and premature termination codons. These alternative mRNAs accumulated in the nonsense-mediated decay mutant <i>upf3</i>, indicating that they are normally subjected to degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that <i>PIRL6</i> is required in both male and female gametogenesis and suggest that sporophytic expression is negatively regulated by unproductive alternative splicing. This posttranscriptional mechanism may function to minimize PIRL6 protein expression in sporophyte tissues while allowing the overlapping adjacent gene to remain widely transcribed.</p>

The Polycomb-Group Repressor MEDEA Attenuates Pathogen Defense
<p>Plants recruit positive and negative regulators for fine tuning the balance between growth and development. Negative regulators of pathogen defense generally modulate defense hormone biosynthesis and signaling. Here, we report a mechanism for attenuation of the defense response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which is mediated by the polycomb-group repressor MEDEA (MEA). Our results showed that pathogen inoculation or exogenous application of salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, or the bacterial 22-amino acid domain of flagellin peptide induces the expression of <i>MEA</i>. <i>MEA</i> expression was higher when plants were inoculated with the avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) carrying the <i>AvrRpt2</i> effector (<i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>) compared to the virulent <i>Pst</i> strain. <i>MEA</i> remains suppressed during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase via DNA and histone (H3K27) methylation, and only the maternal copy is expressed in the female gametophyte and endosperm via histone and DNA demethylation. In contrast, <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i> induces high levels of <i>MEA</i> expression via hyper-accumulation of H3K4me3 at the <i>MEA</i> locus. <i>MEA</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants are susceptible to the fungal pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and bacterial pathogens <i>Pst</i> and <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>, whereas <i>mea</i> mutant plants are more resistant to bacterial pathogens. <i>AvrRpt2</i>-mediated immunity requires the function of RESISTANCE TO P. SYRINGAE2 (RPS2) in Arabidopsis. Using transcriptional analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we established that MEA directly targets <i>RPS2</i> and suppresses its transcription. We screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library using MEA as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay and identified DROUGHT-INDUCED19, a transcription factor that interacts with MEA and recruits it at the <i>RPS2</i> promoter. The results identified a previously unknown mechanism of defense response attenuation in plants.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

RAPTOR Controls Developmental Growth Transitions by Altering the Hormonal and Metabolic Balance
<p>Vegetative growth requires the systemic coordination of numerous cellular processes, which are controlled by regulatory proteins that monitor extracellular and intracellular cues and translate them into growth decisions. In eukaryotes, one of the central factors regulating growth is the serine/threonine protein kinase Target of Rapamycin (TOR), which forms complexes with regulatory proteins. To understand the function of one such regulatory protein, Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR 1B (RAPTOR1B), in plants, we analyzed the effect of <i>raptor1b</i> mutations on growth and physiology in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) by detailed phenotyping, metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analyses. Mutation of <i>RAPTOR1B</i> resulted in a strong reduction of TOR kinase activity, leading to massive changes in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, accumulation of excess starch, and induction of autophagy. These shifts led to a significant reduction of plant growth that occurred nonlinearly during developmental stage transitions. This phenotype was accompanied by changes in cell morphology and tissue anatomy. In contrast to previous studies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we found that the Arabidopsis <i>raptor1b</i> mutation did not affect chloroplast development or photosynthetic electron transport efficiency; however, it resulted in decreased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate and increased stomatal conductance. The <i>raptor1b</i> mutants also had reduced abscisic acid levels. Surprisingly, abscisic acid feeding experiments resulted in partial complementation of the growth phenotypes, indicating the tight interaction between TOR function and hormone synthesis and signaling in plants.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded RNA than double-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

The Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA (LincRNA) Landscape of the Soybean Genome
<p>Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological processes. However, our understanding of lincRNA abundance and function remains very limited especially for agriculturally important plants. Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major legume crop plant providing over a half of global oilseed production. Moreover, soybean can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Soybean has a complex paleopolyploid genome and exhibits many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and floral development complexities. Soybean cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and productivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific developmental processes remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in soybean growth and development. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 samples representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA loci. The lincRNAs were shorter than protein-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more sample specific expression. Few of the loci were found to be conserved in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the soybean genome were detected. Protein-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Positional analysis of lincRNA loci implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integration of publicly available genome-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the soybean genome uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

CELLULASE6 and MANNANASE7 Affect Cell Differentiation and Silique Dehiscence
<p>Cellulases, hemicellulases, and pectinases play important roles in fruit development and maturation. Although mutants with defects in these processes have not been reported for cellulase or hemicellulase genes, the pectinases ARABIDOPSIS DEHISCENCE ZONE POLYGALACTURONASE1 (ADPG1) and ADPG2 were previously shown to be essential for silique dehiscence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we demonstrate that the cellulase gene <i>CELLULASE6</i> (<i>CEL6</i>) and the hemicellulase gene <i>MANNANASE7</i> (<i>MAN7</i>) function in the development and dehiscence of Arabidopsis siliques. We found that these genes were expressed in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive organs and that their expression in the silique partially depended on the INDEHISCENT and ALCATRAZ transcription factors. Cell differentiation was delayed in the dehiscence zone of <i>cel6</i> and <i>man7</i> mutant siliques at early flower development stage 17, and a comparison of the spatio-temporal patterns of <i>CEL6</i> and <i>MAN7</i> expression with the locations of delayed cell differentiation in the <i>cel6</i> and <i>man7</i> mutants revealed that CEL6 and MAN7 likely indirectly affect the timing of cell differentiation in the silique valve at this stage. CEL6 and MAN7 were also found to promote cell degeneration in the separation layer in nearly mature siliques, as cells in this layer remained intact in the <i>cel6</i> and <i>man7</i> mutants and the <i>cel6-1 man7-3</i> double mutant, whereas they degenerated in the wild-type control. Phenotypic studies of single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants revealed that higher-order mutant combinations of <i>cel6-1</i>, <i>man7-3</i>, and <i>adpg1-1</i> and <i>adpg2-1</i> produced more severe silique indehiscent phenotypes than the corresponding lower-order mutant combinations, except for some combinations involving <i>cel6-1</i>, <i>man7-3</i>, and <i>adpg2-1</i>. Our results demonstrate that the ability of the silique to dehisce can be manipulated to different degrees by altering the activities of various cell wall-modifying enzymes.</p>

ER-Anchored Transcription Factors bZIP17 and bZIP28 Regulate Root Elongation
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory network that is activated upon the accumulation of malformed proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three bZIP transcription factors modulate the UPR: bZIP17, bZIP28, and bZIP60. Although bZIP28 and bZIP60 have been relatively well studied, the physiological and transcriptional roles of bZIP17 remain largely unknown. Here, we generated a double knockout mutant of bZIP17 and bZIP28 to elucidate the function of bZIP17. The mutant plant exhibited multiple developmental defects, including markedly reduced root elongation and constantly overinduced bZIP60 activity, indicating the essential roles of bZIP17 and bZIP28 in plant development and UPR modulation. Extended analysis of the transcriptomes of three double knockout mutants of <i>bZIP17</i>, <i>bZIP28</i>, and <i>bZIP60</i> revealed that bZIP28 and bZIP60 are the major activators of the canonical induced UPR. By contrast, bZIP17 functions with bZIP28 to mediate the noninducible expression of multiple genes involved in cell growth, particularly to sustain their expression under stress conditions. Our study reveals pivotal roles of bZIP17 in the plant UPR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative development, with functional redundancy to bZIP28.</p>

LRX Proteins Play a Crucial Role in Pollen Grain and Pollen Tube Cell Wall Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell wall formation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues and required for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed <i>LRXs</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>). Mutations in multiple pollen-expressed <i>lrx</i> genes cause severe defects in pollen germination and pollen tube growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability partially suppresses the pollen tube growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular mechanics.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

TCP Transcription Factors Regulate Shade Avoidance via Directly Mediating the Expression of Both <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR</i>s and Auxin Biosynthetic Genes
<p>Light quality surrounding a plant is largely determined by the density of its neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation. Plants are able to sense shade light signals and initiate a series of adaptation responses, which is known as shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are key factors in the SAS network by regulating the biosynthesis of multiple phytohormones and the expression of cell expansion genes. Although the protein levels of PIFs were found to be acumulated in shade, the transcriptional regulation of <i>PIFs</i> in response to such an environmental signal remains poorly understood. Here we show that TCP17 and its two closely related homologs, TCP5 and TCP13, play an important role in mediating shade-induced hypocotyl elongation by up-regulating auxin biosynthesis via a PIF-dependent and a PIF-independent pathway. In constitutive white light, a <i>tcp5, 13, 17</i> triple mutant (<i>3tcp</i>) showed a subtle hypocotyl defective phenotype. In shade, however, <i>3tcp</i> showed a significantly reduced hypocotyl elongation phenotype, indicating a positive role of TCPs in regulating SAS. Our in-depth biochemical and genetic analyses indicated that TCP17 can be significantly accumulated in shade. TCP17 binds to the promoters of <i>PIFs</i> and <i>YUCCAs</i> to indirectly or directly up-regulate auxin levels in shade. These data provide new insights into our better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of SAS in plants.</p>

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a program exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a program is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How sugar transporters regulate sugar accumulation in fruits is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-concentration Suc. Accumulation of soluble sugars in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described sugar content quantitative trait locus, which contains a putative <i>Tonoplast Sugar Transporter</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and accumulation of sugars in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit sugar content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most sugar-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a sugar-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a sugar-responsive cis‐element within the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter, which contains the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase sugar sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able and fruit crops.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic stress. <i>T. HALOPHILA STRESS RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic stress resistance, especially in salt stress tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and retard the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the target genes’ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The target sequence of the promoter from the target genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to target the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T. HALOPHILA H<sup>+</sup>-PPASE1</i>, and the transcription factors <i>MYB HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED</i> and <i>HOMEOBOX12</i>. In addition, TsNAC1 negatively regulates the expansion of cells, inhibits <i>LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS1</i> and <i>UDP-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE2</i>, and directly controls the expression of <i>MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA14</i>.

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>atively propagated plant species.</p>

The BABY BOOM Transcription Factor Activates the LEC1-ABI3-FUS3-LEC2 Network to Induce Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>Somatic embryogenesis is an example of induced cellular totipotency, where embryos develop from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells rather than from gamete fusion. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth regulators and/or stress treatments. The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2 transcription factors are key regulators of plant cell totipotency, as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings without exogenous growth regulators or stress treatments. Although LEC and BBM proteins regulate the same developmental process, it is not known whether they function in the same molecular pathway. We show that BBM transcriptionally regulates <i>LEC1</i> and <i>LEC2</i>, as well as the two other <i>LAFL</i> genes, <i>FUSCA3</i> (<i>FUS3</i>) and <i>ABSCISIC ACID</i> <i>INSENSITIVE3</i> (<i>ABI3</i>). LEC2 and ABI3 quantitatively regulate BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis, while FUS3 and LEC1 are essential for this process. BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis is dose and context dependent, and the context-dependent phenotypes are associated with differential <i>LAFL</i> expression. We also uncover functional redundancy for somatic embryogenesis among other Arabidopsis BBM-like proteins and show that one of these proteins, PLETHORA2, also regulates <i>LAFL</i> gene expression. Our data place BBM upstream of other major regulators of plant embryo identity and totipotency.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit

The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic engineering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty acid by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant hormone responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant hormones indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

Trimethylguanosine Synthase1 (TGS1) Is Essential for Chilling Tolerance
<p>Chilling stress is a major factor limiting plant development and crop productivity. Because the plant response to chilling is so complex, we are far from understanding the genes important in the response to chilling. To identify new genes important in chilling tolerance, we conducted a novel mutant screen, combining a confirmed SALK T-DNA insertion collection with traditional forward genetics. We screened a pool of more than 3700 confirmed homozygous SALK T-DNA insertion lines for visible defects under prolonged growth at 5°C. Of the chilling-sensitive mutants we observed, mutations at one locus were characterized in detail. This gene, At1g45231, encodes an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1), previously uncharacterized in the plant kingdom. We confirmed that Arabidopsis TGS1 is a functional ortholog of other trimethylguanosine synthases based both on its in vitro methyltransferase activity and on its ability to rescue the cold-growth inhibition of a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae tgs1Δ</i> mutant in vivo. While <i>tgs1</i> mutant plants grew normally at 22°C, their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive growth was severely compromised under chilling conditions. When we transgenically expressed <i>TGS1</i> in the mutant plants, the chilling-sensitive phenotype was relieved, demonstrating that TGS1 is required for chilling tolerance.</p>

<i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> Encode Putative H3K4 Methyltransferases and Are Critical for Plant Development
<p>Methylation of Lys residues in the tail of the H3 histone is a key regulator of chromatin state and gene expression, conferred by a large family of enzymes containing an evolutionarily conserved SET domain. One of the main types of SET domain proteins are those controlling H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The genome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes 12 such proteins, including five ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX (ATX) proteins and seven ATX-Related proteins. Here, we examined three until-now-unexplored ATX proteins, ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5. We found that they exhibit similar domain structures and expression patterns and are redundantly required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive development. Concurrent disruption of the <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> genes caused marked reduction in H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels genome-wide and resulted in thousands of genes expressed ectopically. Furthermore, <i>atx3</i>/<i>atx4</i>/<i>atx5</i> triple mutants resulted in exaggerated phenotypes when combined with the <i>atx2</i> mutant but not with <i>atx1</i>. Together, we conclude that <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> are redundantly required for H3K4 di- and trimethylation at thousands of sites located across the genome, and genomic features associated with targeted regions are different from the <i>ATXR3</i>/<i>SDG2</i>-controlled sites in Arabidopsis.</p>

Concerted Divergence after Gene Duplication in Polycomb Repressive Complexes
<p>Duplicated genes are a major contributor to genome evolution and phenotypic novelty. There are multiple possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. Here, we provide an example of concerted divergence of simultaneously duplicated genes whose products function in the same complex. We studied POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2) in Brassicaceae. The VERNALIZATION (VRN)-PRC2 complex contains VRN2 and SWINGER (SWN), and both genes were duplicated during a whole-genome duplication to generate FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and MEDEA (MEA), which function in the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex that regulates seed development. We examined the expression of <i>FIS2</i>, <i>MEA</i>, and their paralogs, compared their cytosine and histone methylation patterns, and analyzed the sequence evolution of the genes. We found that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have reproductive-specific expression patterns that are correlated and derived from the broadly expressed <i>VRN2</i> and <i>SWN</i> in outgroup species. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), repressive methylation marks are enriched in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>, whereas active marks are associated with their paralogs. We detected comparable accelerated amino acid substitution rates in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> but not in their paralogs. We also show divergence patterns of the PRC2-associated <i>VERNALIZATION5/VIN3-LIKE2</i> that are similar to <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>. These lines of evidence indicate that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have diverged in concert, resulting in functional divergence of the PRC2 complexes in Brassicaceae. This type of concerted divergence is a previously unreported fate of duplicated genes. In addition, the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex modified the regulatory pathways in female gametophyte and seed development.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, heat stress, and recovery from heat stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat stress and recovery from heat stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that wall ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves extensive deposition of wall ingrowths adjacent to cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile leaves, but dramatically less so in mature adult leaves, an observation consistent with PP TC development reflecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and extensive deposition of wall ingrowths was observed in rejuvenated leaves following prolonged defoliation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult leaves correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in wall ingrowth deposition were observed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that wall ingrowth deposition was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

The Formation and Sequestration of Nonendogenous Ketocarotenoids in Transgenic <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>
<p>Ketolated and hydroxylated carotenoids are high-value compounds with industrial, food, and feed applications. Chemical synthesis is currently the production method of choice for these compounds, with no amenable plant sources readily available. In this study, the 4,4′ β-oxygenase (<i>crtW</i>) and 3,3′ β-hydroxylase (c<i>rtZ</i>) genes from <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 were expressed under constitutive transcriptional control in <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>, which has an emerging potential as a biofuel and biorefining feedstock. The transgenic lines produced significant levels of nonendogenous carotenoids in all tissues. In leaf and flower, the carotenoids (∼0.5% dry weight) included 0.3% and 0.48%, respectively, of nonendogenous ketolated and hydroxylated carotenoids. These were 4-ketolutein, echinenone (and its 3-hydroxy derivatives), canthaxanthin, phoenicoxanthin, 4-ketozeaxanthin, and astaxanthin. Stable, homozygous genotypes expressing both transgenes inherited the chemotype. Subcellular fractionation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues and microscopic analysis revealed the presence of ketocarotenoids in thylakoid membranes, not predominantly in the photosynthetic complexes but in plastoglobules. Despite ketocarotenoid production and changes in cellular ultrastructure, intermediary metabolite levels were not dramatically affected. The study illustrates the utility of <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 CRTZ and CRTW to produce ketocarotenoids in a plant species that is being evaluated as a biorefining feedstock, the adaptation of the plastid to sequester nonendogenous carotenoids, and the robustness of plant metabolism to these changes.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative-to-reproductive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing temperatures during spring. The warm winters of recent years interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral induction in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network controlling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting temperature conditions, low and high. The start of reproductive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and induction of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes potentially involved in floral induction, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight potential flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient temperatures, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of potential flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

A Flowering Locus C Homolog Is a Vernalization-Regulated Repressor in <i>Brachypodium</i> and Is Cold Regulated in Wheat
<p>Winter cereals require prolonged cold to transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative to reproductive development. This process, referred to as vernalization, has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In Arabidopsis, a key flowering repressor called <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) quantitatively controls the vernalization requirement. By contrast, in cereals, the vernalization response is mainly regulated by the <i>VERNALIZATION</i> genes, <i>VRN1</i> and <i>VRN2</i>. Here, we characterize <i>ODDSOC2</i>, a recently identified <i>FLC</i> ortholog in monocots, knowing that it belongs to the <i>FLC</i> lineage. By studying its expression in a diverse set of <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions, we find that it is a good predictor of the vernalization requirement. Analyses of transgenics demonstrated that <i>BdODDSOC2</i> functions as a vernalization-regulated flowering repressor. In most <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions <i>BdODDSOC2</i> is down-regulated by cold, and in one of the winter accessions in which this down-regulation was evident, <i>BdODDSOC2</i> responded to cold before <i>BdVRN1.</i> When stably down-regulated, the mechanism is associated with spreading H3K27me3 modifications at the <i>BdODDSOC2</i> chromatin. Finally, homoeolog-specific gene expression analyses identify <i>TaAGL33</i> and its splice variant <i>TaAGL22</i> as the <i>FLC</i> orthologs in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) behaving most similar to <i>Brachypodium ODDSOC2</i>. Overall, our study suggests that <i>ODDSOC2</i> is not only phylogenetically related to <i>FLC</i> in eudicots but also functions as a flowering repressor in the vernalization pathway of <i>Brachypodium</i> and likely other temperate grasses. These insights could prove useful in breeding efforts to refine the vernalization requirement of temperate cereals and adapt varieties to changing climates.</p>

TWS1, a Novel Small Protein, Regulates Various Aspects of Seed and Plant Development
<p>Small proteins have long been overlooked due to their poor annotation and the experimental challenges they pose. However, in recent years, their role in various processes has started to emerge, opening new research avenues. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of two allelic mutants, <i>twisted seed1-1</i> (<i>tws1-1</i>) and <i>tws1-2</i>, which exhibit an array of developmental and biochemical phenotypes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds. We have identified <i>AT5G01075</i> as the subtending gene encoding a small protein of 81 amino acids localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. <i>TWS1</i> is strongly expressed in seeds, where it regulates both embryo development and accumulation of storage compounds. <i>TWS1</i> loss-of-function seeds exhibit increased starch, sucrose, and protein accumulation at the detriment of fatty acids. <i>TWS1</i> is also expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive tissues, where it is responsible for proper epidermal cell morphology and overall plant growth. At the cellular level, <i>TWS1</i> is responsible for cuticle deposition on epidermal cells and organization of the endomembrane system.

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

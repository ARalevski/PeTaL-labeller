Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p>Laser cooling of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of ions in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>-plasma confinement and manipulation.</p>

Quantum-critical conductivity of the Dirac fluid in graphene
<p>Graphene near charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ity is expected to behave like a quantum-critical, relativistic plasma—the “Dirac fluid”—in which massless electrons and holes collide at a rapid rate. We used on-chip terahertz spectroscopy to measure the frequency-dependent optical conductivity of clean, micrometer-scale graphene at electron temperatures between 77 and 300 kelvin. At charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ity, we observed the quantum-critical scattering rate characteristic of the Dirac fluid. At higher doping, we detected two distinct current-carrying modes with zero and nonzero total momenta, a manifestation of relativistic hydrodynamics. Our work reveals the quantum criticality and unusual dynamic excitations near charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ity in graphene.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise
<p>In modern microelectronic devices, hot electrons accelerate, scatter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ate energy in nanoscale dimensions. Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-electron energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the electrons. We realize electronic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or shot noise, associated with ultrafast hot-electron kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-electron distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide crystal lattice. With nanoconstriction devices, we reveal unexpected nonlocal energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation at room temperature, which is reminiscent of ballistic transport of low-temperature quantum conductors.</p>

Imaging resonant dissipation from individual atomic defects in graphene
<p>Conversion of electric current into heat involves microscopic processes that operate on nanometer length scales and release minute amounts of power. Although central to our understanding of the electrical properties of materials, individual mediators of energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation have so far eluded direct observation. Using scanning nanothermometry with submicrokelvin sensitivity, we visualized and controlled phonon emission from individual atomic-scale defects in graphene. The inferred electron-phonon “cooling power spectrum” exhibits sharp peaks when the Fermi level comes into resonance with electronic quasi-bound states at such defects. Rare in the bulk but abundant at graphene’s edges, switchable atomic-scale phonon emitters provide the dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation mechanism. Our work offers insights for addressing key materials challenges in modern electronics and enables control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation at the nanoscale.</p>

Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus
<p>The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for vaccine design against these threats to global health.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude winds flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

Nitrogen fixation and reduction at boron
<p>Currently, the only compounds known to support fixation and functionalization of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) under nonmatrix conditions are based on metals. Here we present the observation of N<sub>2</sub> binding and reduction by a nonmetal, specifically a dicoordinate borylene. Depending on the reaction conditions under which potassium graphite is introduced as a reductant, N<sub>2</sub> binding to two borylene units results in either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> (B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) or dianionic ([B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2–</sup>) products that can be interconverted by respective exposure to further reductant or to air.

Potent peptidic fusion inhibitors of influenza virus
<p>Influenza therapeutics with new targets and mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat potential pandemics, emerging viruses, and constantly mutating strains in circulation. We report here on the design and structural characterization of potent peptidic inhibitors of influenza hemagglutinin. The peptide design was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114). The optimized peptides exhibit nanomolar affinity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ization against influenza A group 1 viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and avian H5N1 strains. The peptide inhibitors bind to the highly conserved stem epitope and block the low pH–induced conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. These peptidic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate the development of new small molecule– and peptide-based therapeutics against influenza virus.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a fluid flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid fluids but can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real fluids remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous fluid and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real flows.</p>

Tough adhesives for diverse wet surfaces
<p>Adhesion to wet and dynamic surfaces, including biological tissues, is important in many fields but has proven to be extremely challenging. Existing adhesives are cytotoxic, adhere weakly to tissues, or cannot be used in wet environments. We report a bioinspired design for adhesives consisting of two layers: an adhesive surface and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ative matrix. The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent bonds, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation through hysteresis. The two layers synergistically lead to higher adhesion energies on wet surfaces as compared with those of existing adhesives. Adhesion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements. This family of adhesives may be useful in many areas of application, including tissue adhesives, wound dressings, and tissue repair.</p>

Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection
<p>Crop leaves in full sunlight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field crops up to 20% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in <i>Nicotiana</i> (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and crops, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food crops and a much-needed yield jump.</p>

Rapid development of a DNA vaccine for Zika virus
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified as a cause of congenital disease during the explosive outbreak in the Americas and Caribbean that began in 2015. Because of the ongoing fetal risk from endemic disease and travel-related exposures, a vaccine to prevent viremia in women of childbearing age and their partners is imperative. We found that vaccination with DNA expressing the premembrane and envelope proteins of ZIKV was immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, and protection against viremia after ZIKV challenge correlated with serum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing activity. These data not only indicate that DNA vaccination could be a successful approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of vaccine-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing activity that prevents viremia after acute infection.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> or nearly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart

Cathepsin G Controls Arterial But Not Venular Myeloid Cell Recruitment

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large arrays of individually controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparation of fully loaded two-dimensional arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single atom and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> atoms in tunable two-dimensional geometries.</p>

A “Trojan horse” bispecific-antibody strategy for broad protection against ebolaviruses
<p>There is an urgent need for monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies that broadly protect against Ebola virus and other filoviruses. The conserved, essential interaction between the filovirus glycoprotein, GP, and its entry receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides an attractive target for such mAbs but is shielded by multiple mechanisms, including physical sequestration in late endosomes. Here, we describe a bispecific-antibody strategy to target this interaction, in which mAbs specific for NPC1 or the GP receptor–binding site are coupled to a mAb against a conserved, surface-exposed GP epitope. Bispecific antibodies, but not parent mAbs, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ized all known ebolaviruses by coopting viral particles themselves for endosomal delivery and conferred postexposure protection against multiple ebolaviruses in mice. Such “Trojan horse” bispecific antibodies have potential as broad antifilovirus immunotherapeutics.</p>

Priming HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody precursors in human Ig loci transgenic mice
<p>A major obstacle to a broadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibody (bnAb)–based HIV vaccine is the activation of appropriate B cell precursors. Germline-targeting immunogens must be capable of priming rare bnAb precursors in the physiological setting. We tested the ability of the VRC01-class bnAb germline-targeting immunogen eOD-GT8 60mer (60-subunit self-assembling nanoparticle) to activate appropriate precursors in mice transgenic for human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci. Despite an average frequency of, at most, about one VRC01-class precursor per mouse, we found that at least 29% of singly immunized mice produced a VRC01-class memory response, suggesting that priming generally succeeded when at least one precursor was present. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using germline targeting to prime specific and exceedingly rare bnAb-precursor B cells within a humanlike repertoire.</p>

Replication of human noroviruses in stem cell–derived human enteroids
<p>The major barrier to research and development of effective interventions for human noroviruses (HuNoVs) has been the lack of a robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation system. HuNoVs are the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. We report the successful cultivation of multiple HuNoV strains in enterocytes in stem cell–derived, nontransformed human intestinal enteroid monolayer cultures. Bile, a critical factor of the intestinal milieu, is required for strain-dependent HuNoV replication. Lack of appropriate histoblood group antigen expression in intestinal cells restricts virus replication, and infectivity is abrogated by inactivation (e.g., irradiation, heating) and serum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ization. This culture system recapitulates the human intestinal epithelium, permits human host-pathogen studies of previously noncultivatable pathogens, and allows the assessment of methods to prevent and treat HuNoV infections.</p>

The Amino Acid Permease 5 (OsAAP5) Regulates Tiller Number and Grain Yield in Rice
<p>As fundamental nutrients, amino acids are important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) growth and development. Here, we identified the amino acid permease 5 (OsAAP5), that regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice. The <i>OsAAP5</i> promoter sequence differed between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties. Lower expression of <i>OsAAP5</i> in the young leaf blade in <i>indica</i> varieties than in <i>japonica</i> varieties was associated with more tillers in <i>indica</i> than in <i>japonica</i>. Down-regulation of <i>OsAAP5</i> expression in <i>japonica</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, whereas <i>OsAAP5</i> overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect. Both a protoplast amino acid uptake assay and HPLC analysis indicated that more basic (Lys, Arg) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> (Val, Ala) amino acids were transported and accumulated in the OE lines than in the wild type, but the opposite was observed in the RNAi lines. Furthermore, exogenous application of Lys, Arg, Val, and Ala in the OE lines substantially inhibited tiller bud elongation, but the effect was lost in the RNAi lines. Notably, concentrations of the cytokinins cis-zeatin and dihydrozeatin were much lower in the OE lines than in the wild type, whereas concentrations in the RNAi lines were higher. Thus, <i>OsAAP5</i> could regulate tiller bud outgrowth by affecting cytokinin levels, and knockout of <i>OsAAP5</i> could be valuable for <i>japonica</i> breeding programs seeking high yield and grain quality.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be oxidatively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-oxidative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains oxidized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 oxidation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 oxidation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 oxidation for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of chlorophyll and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ate excess absorbed energy as heat via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting complex family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy quenching close to the core of photosystem II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the antenna. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the antenna complexes or in the core complex. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that core complex-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the antenna complex. Overall, our data clarify the complex molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

Nitric Oxide Mediates Nitrite-Sensing and Acclimation and Triggers a Remodeling of Lipids
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intermediate of the nitrogen cycle, an industrial pollutant, and a marker of climate change. NO also acts as a gaseous transmitter in a variety of biological processes. The impact of environmental NO needs to be addressed. In diatoms, a dominant phylum in phytoplankton, NO was reported to mediate programmed cell death in response to diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes. Here, using the <i>Phaeodactylum</i> Pt1 strain, 2E,4E-decadienal supplied in the micromolar concentration range led to a nonspecific cell toxicity. We reexamined NO biosynthesis and response in <i>Phaeodactylum</i>. NO inhibits cell growth and triggers triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Feeding experiments indicate that NO is not produced from Arg but via conversion of nitrite by the nitrate reductase. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that NO up-regulates the expression of the plastid nitrite reductase and genes involved in the subsequent incorporation of ammonium into amino acids, via both Gln synthesis and Orn-urea pathway. The phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also up-regulated, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which can feed TAG accumulation upon exposure to NO. Transcriptional reprogramming leading to higher TAG content is balanced with a decrease of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in the plastid via posttranslational inhibition of MGDG synthase enzymatic activity by NO. Intracellular and transient NO emission acts therefore at the basis of a nitrite-sensing and acclimating system, whereas a long exposure to NO can additionally induce a redirection of carbon to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipids and a stress response.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty acids from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty acids accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty acids and phosphatidic acid, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty acid overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty acids remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty acid turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

9-cis-Neoxanthin in Light Harvesting Complexes of Photosystem II Regulates the Binding of Violaxanthin and Xanthophyll Cycle
<p>The light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a/b</i> complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is able to switch to multiple functions under different light conditions (i.e. harvesting solar energy for photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ating excess excitation energy for photoprotection). The role of the different carotenoids bound to LHCII in regulating the structure and function of the complex is a long-lasting question in photosynthesis research. 9-cis-Neoxanthin (Nx) is one of the important carotenoids, which can only be found in the LHCIIs. High-resolution structural analysis of LHCII shows that Nx is located between different monomeric LHCIIs, with one side protruding into the lipid membrane. In this study, the various functional significances of this unique feature of Nx binding in LHCII are studied with the in vitro reconstituted LHCIIs both with and without Nx and the native complexes isolated either from wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) or from its mutant <i>aba4-3</i> lacking Nx. Our results reveal that the binding of Nx affects the binding affinity of violaxanthin (Vx) to LHCII significantly. In the absence of Nx, Vx has a much higher binding affinity to trimeric LHCII. The strong coordination between Nx and Vx at the interfaces of adjacent monomers of LHCII plays an important role both in operating the xanthophyll cycle and in the transient modulation of nonphotochemical quenching.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been correlated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are still required to confirm the exact role of AOX in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively correlated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively correlated with photosynthetic performance. Correlations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly correlated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Carbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Photosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation mechanisms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green alga that can grow using various carbon sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where carbon supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the carbon availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the carbon-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ative mechanisms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the carbon availability.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ity tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given site makes an independent contribution to fitness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid sites in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the experimentally determined fitness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We tested this hypothesis by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. Fitness effects ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal effects were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious effects ranged from near <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> (−26.7% reduction of fitness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different fitness effects in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Evidence from a House Finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>) Spleen Transcriptome for Adaptive Evolution and Biased Gene Conversion in Passerine Birds
<p>Identifying genes influenced by natural selection can provide information about lineage-specific adaptations, and transcriptomes generated by next-generation sequencing are a useful resource for identifying such genes. Here, we utilize a spleen transcriptome for the house finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>), an emerging model for sexual selection and disease ecology, together with previously sequenced avian genomes (chicken, turkey, and zebra finch), to investigate lineage-specific adaptations within birds. An analysis of 4,398 orthologous genes revealed a significantly higher ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions and significantly higher GC content in passerines than in galliforms, an observation deviating from strictly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> expectations but consistent with an effect of biased gene conversion on the evolutionary rate in passerines. These data also showed that genes exhibiting signs of positive selection and fast evolution in passerines have functional roles related to fat metabolism, neurodevelopment, and ion binding.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Activation of the cnidarian oxidative stress response by ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil
<p>Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive chemicals capable of causing oxidative stress and cellular damage. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing such oxidants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of antioxidant enzymes (transcript expression, protein expression and/or enzymatic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity tests, juvenile <i>N. vectensis</i> showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult <i>N. vectensis</i> exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo[a]pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. Antioxidant enzyme transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure. Expression patterns were most strongly affected by UV exposure but varied between experiments, suggesting that responses vary according to the intensity and duration of exposure. These experiments provide a basis for comparison with other cnidarian taxa and for further studies of the oxidative stress response in <i>N. vectensis.</i></p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

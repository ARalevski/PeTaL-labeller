<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing symbiosis.</p>

The Nitrate Transporter Family Protein LjNPF8.6 Controls the N-Fixing Nodule Activity
<p>N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing nodules are new organs formed on legume roots as a result of the beneficial interaction with soil bacteria, rhizobia. The nodule functioning is still a poorly characterized step of the symbiotic interaction, as only a few of the genes induced in N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing nodules have been functionally characterized. We present here the characterization of a member of the <i>Lotus japonicus</i> nitrate transporter1/peptide transporter family, <i>LjNPF8.6</i>. The phenotypic characterization carried out in independent <i>L. japonicus</i> LORE1 insertion lines indicates a positive role of LjNPF8.6 on nodule functioning, as knockout mutants display N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation deficiency (25%) and increased nodular superoxide content. The partially compromised nodule functioning induces two striking phenotypes: anthocyanin accumulation already displayed 4 weeks after inoculation and shoot biomass deficiency, which is detected by long-term phenotyping. LjNPF8.6 achieves nitrate uptake in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes at both 0.5 and 30 m<sc>m</sc> external concentrations, and a possible role as a nitrate transporter in the control of N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing nodule activity is discussed</p>

Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to estimates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed phylogenetic tree. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for each family is unresolved.

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Phylogenomics reveals multiple losses of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis
<p>The root nodule symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing bacteria affects global nitrogen cycles and food production but is restricted to a subset of genera within a single clade of flowering plants. To explore the genetic basis for this scattered occurrence, we sequenced the genomes of 10 plant species covering the diversity of nodule morphotypes, bacterial symbionts, and infection strategies. In a genome-wide comparative analysis of a total of 37 plant species, we discovered signatures of multiple independent loss-of-function events in the indispensable symbiotic regulator <i>NODULE INCEPTION</i> in 10 of 13 genomes of nonnodulating species within this clade. The discovery that multiple independent losses shaped the present-day distribution of nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing root nodule symbiosis in plants reveals a phylogenetically wider distribution in evolutionary history and a so-far-underestimated selection pressure against this symbiosis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the ability of legumes to associate with nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence nodulation. We show that SLs promote infection thread formation, as a null SL-deficient pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infection threads than wild-type plants, and this reduction can be overcome by the application of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the plant before or after infection thread formation, since SL-deficient plants displayed a similar ability to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-deficient nodules appear to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong> nitrogen at a similar rate to those of wild-type plants. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infection thread formation or nodule number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudation or the ability of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infection thread formation was accompanied by reduced expression of some early nodulation genes. Importantly, SL synthesis is down-regulated by mutations in genes of the Nod LCO signaling pathway, and this requires the downstream transcription factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the expression of certain SL biosynthesis genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL biosynthesis. SLs appear to influence nodulation independently of ethylene action, as SL-deficient and ethylene-insensitive double mutant plants display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene synthesis or vice versa.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with exchangeable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer surgeons an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   reported an increased rate of revision after primary THA using femoral   stems with an exchangeable neck. The aim of this study was to provide   a more comprehensive up-to-date analysis of primary THA using femoral   stems with exchangeable and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed necks.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The data included all primary THA procedures performed for osteoarthritis   (OA), reported to the AOANJRR between 01 September 1999 and 31 December   2014.

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation. The novel method of LDL-C estimation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting samples than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Roles of RbcX in Carboxysome Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942
<p>Rubisco is the essential enzyme mediating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during photosynthesis. In cyanobacteria, Rubisco enzymes are densely packed and encapsulated in a specialized organelle known as the carboxysome. Well-defined Rubisco assembly and carboxysome formation are pivotal for efficient CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation. Numerous chaperone proteins, including RbcX, are essential for proper protein folding and Rubisco assembly. In this study, we investigated the in vivo function of RbcX in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942 (Syn7942) using molecular, biochemical, and live-cell fluorescence imaging approaches. Our results show that genetic deletion of the <i>rbcX</i> gene affects Rubisco abundance, as well as carboxysome formation and spatial distribution. Moreover, RbcX appears as one component of the carboxysome and shows a dynamic interaction with Rubisco enzymes. These in vivo observations provide insight into the role of RbcX from Syn7942 in mediating carboxysome assembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying Rubisco assembly and carboxysome biogenesis will provide essential information required for engineering functional CO<sub>2</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing complexes in heterogeneous organisms, especially plants, with the aim of boosting photosynthesis and agricultural productivity.</p>

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the roots. Plants release considerable amounts of photosynthetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the roots into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the roots and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc release from plant roots. We found that the primary roots of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) released more Glc from the base of the root than from the root tip and that the Glc release rate is reduced in response to water stress. These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc release in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary roots using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species. These findings and their implications on root-rhizosphere interactions are discussed.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

<i>MtNODULE ROOT1</i> and <i>MtNODULE ROOT2</i> Are Essential for Indeterminate Nodule Identity
<p>Symbiotic interactions between legume plants and rhizobia result in the formation of nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing nodules, but the molecular actors and the mechanisms allowing for the maintenance of nodule identity are poorly understood. <i>Medicago truncatula NODULE ROOT1</i> (<i>MtNOOT1</i>), <i>Pisum sativum COCHLEATA1</i> (<i>PsCOCH1</i>), and <i>Lotus japonicus NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE1</i> (<i>LjNBCL1</i>) are orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtBLADE-ON-PETIOLE1/2</i> and are members of the <i>NBCL</i> gene family, which has conserved roles in plant development and is essential for indeterminate and determinate nodule identity in legumes. The loss of function of <i>MtNOOT1</i>, <i>PsCOCH1</i>, and <i>LjNBCL1</i> triggers a partial loss of nodule identity characterized by the development of ectopic roots arising from nodule vascular meristems. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a second gene involved in regulating indeterminate nodule identity in <i>M. truncatula</i>, <i>MtNOOT2</i>. <i>MtNOOT2</i> is the paralog of <i>MtNOOT1</i> and belongs to a second legume-specific <i>NBCL</i> subclade, the <i>NBCL2</i> clade. <i>MtNOOT2</i> expression was induced during early nodule formation, and it was expressed primarily in the nodule central meristem. <i>Mtnoot2</i> mutants did not present any particular symbiotic phenotype; however, the loss of function of both <i>MtNOOT1</i> and <i>MtNOOT2</i> resulted in the complete loss of nodule identity and was accompanied by drastic changes in the expression of symbiotic, defense, and root apical meristem marker genes. <i>Mtnoot1 noot2</i> double mutants developed only non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing root-like structures that were no longer able to host symbiotic rhizobia. This study provides original insights into the molecular basis underlying nodule identity in legumes forming indeterminate nodules.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

The Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA (LincRNA) Landscape of the Soybean Genome
<p>Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological processes. However, our understanding of lincRNA abundance and function remains very limited especially for agriculturally important plants. Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major legume crop plant providing over a half of global oilseed production. Moreover, soybean can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong> atmospheric nitrogen. Soybean has a complex paleopolyploid genome and exhibits many vegetative and floral development complexities. Soybean cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and productivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific developmental processes remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in soybean growth and development. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 samples representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA loci. The lincRNAs were shorter than protein-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more sample specific expression. Few of the loci were found to be conserved in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the soybean genome were detected. Protein-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Positional analysis of lincRNA loci implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integration of publicly available genome-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the soybean genome uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

Regulation of Sucrose Transporters and Phloem Loading in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>Suc transporters (SUTs) play a key role in the allocation and partitioning of photosynthetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed carbon in plants. While a function could be assigned to many members of the SUT family, almost no information is available on their regulation. Here, the transcriptional regulation of SUTs in response to various environmental stimuli in the leaves of five dicots (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], soybean [<i>Glycine max</i>], potato [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>], tomato [<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i>], and poplar [<i>Populus</i> spp.]) and four monocots (maize [<i>Zea</i> <i>mays</i>], rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>], and barley [<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]) was investigated. Extensive data on expression of <i>SUT</i>s in relation to changes of environmental conditions were obtained through a global analysis of 168 transcriptomics data sets. Results were validated by quantitative PCR measurements and extended by the measurement of photosynthesis rate and phloem sugar content to draw insight on the correlation of <i>SUT</i> expression and sugar export from leaves. For the apoplasmic phloem loaders, a clear difference in transcriptional regulation in response to different environmental stimuli was observed. The consistent patterns of <i>SUT</i> expression under abiotic stress indicates which types of SUTs are involved in the regulation of leaf sugar status and in stress signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that down-regulation of phloem loading is likely to be caused by transcriptional regulation of SUTs, while up-regulation depends on post-transcriptional regulation. In poplar, expression of <i>PtaSUT4</i> was found to consistently respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting a significant role in the regulation of sugar export from leaves in this passive symplasmic phloem loader.</p>

DELLA1-Mediated Gibberellin Signaling Regulates Cytokinin-Dependent Symbiotic Nodulation
<p>In legume plants, low-nitrogen soils promote symbiotic interactions with rhizobial bacteria, leading to the formation of nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing root nodules. Among critical signals regulating this developmental process are bacterial Nod Factors (NFs) and several plant hormones, including cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs). Here, we show in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that GA signaling mediated by DELLA1 decreases the amount of bioactive CKs in roots and negatively impacts the Cytokinin Response1 (CRE1)-dependent NF activation of a subset of CK-signaling genes as well as of the CK-regulated <i>Nodulation Signaling Pathway2</i> and <i>Ethylene Response Factor Required for Nodulation1</i> early nodulation genes. Consistently, a dominant-active DELLA1 protein can partially rescue the reduced nodulation of the <i>cre1</i> mutant and triggers the formation of nodule-like structures when expressed in the root cortex or in the root epidermis. This suggests a model where the DELLA1-mediated GA signaling interplays with the CRE1-dependent CK pathway to regulate early nodulation in response to both NF and CK signals critical for this symbiotic interaction.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing nodule structure.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone auxin into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral roots. To test the role of auxin influx in nodulation we used the auxin influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of auxin influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of developing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several auxin response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root gravitropism, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and auxin resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS auxin reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots developed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early auxin responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of auxin during nodule formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

Forever Young: The Role of Ubiquitin Receptor DA1 and E3 Ligase BIG BROTHER in Controlling Leaf Growth and Development
<p>The final size of plant organs is determined by a combination of cell proliferation and cell expansion. Leaves account for a large part of above-ground biomass and provide energy to complete the plant’s life cycle. Although the final size of leaves is remarkably constant under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed environmental conditions, several genes have been described to enhance leaf growth when their expression is modulated. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> increase leaf size, an effect that is synergistically enhanced in the double mutant. Here, we show that overexpression of a dominant-negative version of <i>DA1</i> enhances leaf size in a broad range of natural accessions of this species, indicating a highly conserved role of this protein in controlling organ size. We also found that during early stages of development, leaves of <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> mutants were already larger than the isogenic Col-0 wild type, but this phenotype was triggered by different cellular mechanisms. Later during development, <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> leaves showed a prolonged longevity, which was enhanced in the double mutant. Conversely, ectopic expression of <i>DA1</i> or <i>BB</i> restricted growth and promoted leaf senescence. In concert, shortly upon induction of <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> expression, several marker genes for the transition from proliferation to expansion were highly up-regulated. Additionally, multiple genes involved in maintaining the mitotic cell cycle were rapidly down-regulated and senescence genes were strongly up-regulated, particularly upon <i>BB</i> induction. With these results, we demonstrate that DA1 and BB restrict leaf size and promote senescence through converging and different mechanisms.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune gene diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin genes were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five genes showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these genes in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin gene (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this gene, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin genes allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune genes, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are controlled by a surprisingly limited number of conserved signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early animal evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the control of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size control throughout bilaterian animals. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation as   determined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%.

Custom-made total ankle arthroplasty for the salvage of major talar bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A failed total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is often associated with   much bone loss. As an alternative to arthrodesis, the surgeon may   consider a custom-made talar component to compensate for the bone   loss. Our aim in this study was to assess the functional and radiological   outcome after the use of such a component at mid- to long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 12 patients (five women and seven men, mean age 53   years; 36 to77) with a failed TAA and a large talar defect underwent   a revision procedure using a custom-made talar component. The design   of the custom-made components was based on CT scans and standard   radiographs, when compared with the contralateral ankle. After the   anterior talocalcaneal joint was fused, the talar component was   introduced and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed to the body of the calcaneum.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (1 to 13), 11 ankles were stable   with no radiological evidence of loosening. Only one was lost to   follow-up. The mean arc of movement was 21<sup>°</sup> (10<sup>°</sup> to   35<sup>°</sup>). A total of nine patients (75%) were satisfied or   very satisfied with the outcome, two (17%) were satisfied but with   reservations and one (8%) was not satisfied.

The outcome and complications of vascularised fibular grafts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting has been used for the treatment   of large bony defects for more than 40 years. However, there is   little information about the risk factors for failure and whether   newer locking techniques of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ation improve the rates of union.   The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of union of free   fibular grafts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed with locking and traditional techniques, and   to quantify the risk factors for nonunion and failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review involved 134 consecutive procedures over   a period of 20 years. Of these, 25 were excluded leaving 109 patients   in the study. There were 66 men and 43 women, with a mean age of   33 years (5 to 78). Most (62) were performed for oncological indications,   and the most common site (52) was the lower limb.

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71). No significant difference was observed in frequency of severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, targeting a higher versus a lower mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not seem to affect the volume or number of new cerebral infarcts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Sex Differences in Faculty Rank Among Academic Cardiologists in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies demonstrate that women physicians are less likely than men to be full professors. Comprehensive evidence examining whether sex differences in faculty rank exist in academic cardiology, adjusting for experience and research productivity, is lacking. Therefore, we evaluated for sex differences in faculty rank among a comprehensive, contemporary cohort of US cardiologists after adjustment for several factors that impact academic advancement, including measures of clinical experience and research productivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified all US cardiologists with medical school faculty appointments in 2014 by using the American Association of Medical Colleges faculty roster and linked this list to a comprehensive physician database from Doximity, a professional networking website for doctors. Data on physician age, sex, years since residency, cardiology subspecialty, publications, National Institutes of Health grants, and registered clinical trials were available for all academic cardiologists. We estimated sex differences in full professorship, adjusting for these factors and medical school–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed effects in a multivariable regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3810 cardiologists with faculty appointments in 2014 (13.3% of all US cardiologists), 630 (16.5%) were women. Women faculty were younger than men (mean age, 48.3 years versus 53.5 years, <i>P</i><0.001), had fewer total publications (mean number: 16.5 publications versus 25.2 publications; <i>P</i><0.001), were similarly likely to have National Institutes of Health funding (proportion with at least 1 National Institutes of Health award, 10.8% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.77), and were less likely to have a registered clinical trial (percentage with at least 1 clinical trial, 8.9% versus 11.1%; <i>P</i>=0.10). Among 3180 men, 973 (30.6%) were full professors in comparison with 100 (15.9%) of 630 women. In adjusted analyses, women were less likely to be full professors than men (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.02; adjusted proportions, 22.7% versus 26.7%; absolute difference, –4.0%; 95% confidence interval, –7.5% to –0.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among cardiology faculty at US medical schools, women were less likely than men to be full professors after accounting for several factors known to influence faculty rank.</p></sec>

For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke rate >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke rates below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke rates between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke rates >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke rates and rates corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores. These variations can affect the point score threshold for recommending oral anticoagulants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke rates that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for anticoagulating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Common diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are complex in etiology. The interaction of genetic susceptibility with lifestyle factors may play a prominent role. However, gene-lifestyle interactions for CHD have been difficult to identify. Here, we investigate interaction of smoking behavior, a potent lifestyle factor, with genotypes that have been shown to associate with CHD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data on 60 919 CHD cases and 80 243 controls from 29 studies for gene-smoking interactions for genetic variants at 45 loci previously reported to be associated with CHD risk. We also studied 5 loci associated with smoking behavior. Study-specific gene-smoking interaction effects were calculated and pooled using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed-effects meta-analyses. Interaction analyses were declared to be significant at a <i>P</i> value of <1.0×10<sup>–3</sup> (Bonferroni correction for 50 tests).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified novel gene-smoking interaction for a variant upstream of the <i>ADAMTS7</i> gene. Every T allele of rs7178051 was associated with lower CHD risk by 12% in never-smokers (<i>P</i>=1.3×10<sup>–16</sup>) in comparison with 5% in ever-smokers (<i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>–4</sup>), translating to a 60% loss of CHD protection conferred by this allelic variation in people who smoked tobacco (interaction <i>P</i> value=8.7×10<sup>–5</sup>). The protective T allele at rs7178051 was also associated with reduced <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression in human aortic endothelial cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines. Exposure of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells to cigarette smoke extract led to induction of <i>ADAMTS7.</i></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Allelic variation at rs7178051 that associates with reduced <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression confers stronger CHD protection in never-smokers than in ever-smokers. Increased vascular <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression may contribute to the loss of CHD protection in smokers.</p></sec>

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac death. We calculated the risk estimates for main outcomes according to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fix</span></strong>ed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher risk of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher risk at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased risk of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the risk of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year. Risk of cardiac death was similar between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our meta-analysis of randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years demonstrated a higher risk of ST and of TLF in patients treated with BVS compared with EES. Of note, BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of TLF and TLR was higher between 1 and 2 years.</p></sec>

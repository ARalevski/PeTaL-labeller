Single-component quasicrystalline nanocrystal superlattices through flexible polygon tiling rule
<p>Quasicrystalline superlattices (QC-SLs) generated from single-component colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks have been predicted by computer simulations but are challenging to reproduce experimentally. We discovered that 10-fold QC-SLs could self-organize from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots with anisotropic patchiness. Transmission electron microscopy and tomography measurements allow structural reconstruction of the QC-SL from the nanoscale packing to the atomic-scale orientation alignments. The unique QC order leads to a tiling concept, the “flexible polygon tiling rule,” that replicates the experimental observations. The keys for the single-component QC-SL formation were identified to be the anisotropic shape and patchiness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks and the assembly microscopic environment. Our discovery may spur the creation of various superstructures using anisotropic objects through an enthalpy-driven route.</p>

Topological protection of biphoton states
<p>The robust generation and propagation of multiphoton quantum states are crucial for applications in quantum information, computing, and communications. Although photons are intrinsically well isolated from the thermal environment, scaling to large quantum optical devices is still limited by scattering loss and other errors arising from random fabrication imperfections. The recent discoveries regarding topological phases have introduced avenues to construct quantum systems that are protected against scattering and imperfections. We experimentally demonstrate topological protection of biphoton states, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing block for quantum information systems. We provide clear evidence of the robustness of the spatial features and the propagation constant of biphoton states generated within a nanophotonics lattice with nontrivial topology and propose a concrete path to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> robust entangled states for quantum gates.</p>

Self-assembly of lattices with high structural complexity from a geometrically simple molecule
<p>Here we report an anomalous porous molecular crystal built of C–H···N-bonded double-layered roof-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong> components and wall components of a segregatively interdigitated architecture. This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong> formation and using its other wedge for wall formation. Although a C–H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous crystal maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph. Though this nonporous crystal survives even at 325°C, it can retrieve the parent porosity under acetonitrile vapor. These findings show how one can translate simplicity into ultrahigh complexity.</p>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and fluidity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to liquid crystals, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks. We dispersed micrometer-long inorganic colloidal rods in a nematic liquid crystalline fluid of molecular rods. Both types of uniaxial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic fluid, in which like-sized rods are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal rods. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase diagram with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of rods. Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-colloidal fluids can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

Multiplexed gene synthesis in emulsions for exploring protein functional landscapes

Atomic structure of the human cytomegalovirus capsid with its securing tegument layer of pp150
<p>Herpesviruses possess a genome-pressurized capsid. The 235-kilobase genome of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is by far the largest of any herpesvirus, yet it has been unclear how its capsid, which is similar in size to those of other herpesviruses, is stabilized. Here we report a HCMV atomic structure consisting of the herpesvirus-conserved capsid proteins MCP, Tri1, Tri2, and SCP and the HCMV-specific tegument protein pp150—totaling ~4000 molecules and 62 different conformers. MCPs manifest as a complex of insertions around a bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like domain, which gives rise to three classes of capsid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong>–defining interactions; triplexes, composed of two “embracing” Tri2 conformers and a “third-wheeling” Tri1, fasten the capsid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong>. HCMV-specific strategies include using hexon channels to accommodate the genome and pp150 helix bundles to secure the capsid via cysteine tetrad–to-SCP interactions. Our structure should inform rational design of countermeasures against HCMV, other herpesviruses, and even HIV/AIDS.</p>

Bug mapping and fitness testing of chemically synthesized chromosome X

As part of the effort to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> a designer eukaryotic genome, yeast synthetic chromosome X (synX), designed as 707,459 base pairs, was synthesized chemically. SynX exhibited good fitness under a wide variety of conditions. A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell fitness (“bugs”). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex amplifications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in <i>FIP1</i>, and a loxPsym site affecting promoter function of <i>ATP2</i>. PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast genome debugging and an efficient strategy for phenotype-genotype mapping.</p>

Global rates of marine sulfate reduction and implications for sub–sea-floor metabolic activities
<p>Sulfate reduction is a globally important redox process in marine sediments, yet global rates are poorly quantified. We developed an artificial neural network trained with 199 sulfate profiles, constrained with geomorphological and geochemical maps to estimate global sulfate-reduction rate distributions. Globally, 11.3 teramoles of sulfate are reduced yearly (~15% of previous estimates), accounting for the oxidation of 12 to 29% of the organic carbon flux to the sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong>. Combined with global cell distributions in marine sediments, these results indicate a strong contrast in sub–sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong> prokaryote habitats: In continental margins, global cell numbers in sulfate-depleted sediment exceed those in the overlying sulfate-bearing sediment by one order of magnitude, whereas in the abyss, most life occurs in oxic and/or sulfate-reducing sediments.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate immunity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host immunity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host immunity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered immunity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant immunity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>s a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion for the further characterization of E2s in plant immunity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host immunity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread methane release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong> associated with large-scale methane expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, methane from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Biological control of aragonite formation in stony corals
<p>Little is known about how stony corals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> their calcareous skeletons. There are two prevailing hypotheses: that it is a physicochemically dominated process and that it is a biologically mediated one. Using a combination of ultrahigh-resolution three<i>-</i>dimensional imaging and two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that mineral deposition is biologically driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid mineral phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic precipitation of aragonite.</p>

Decoding the evolution of species

Yet these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks are extraordinarily similar among animals, and human proteins can substitute for their counterparts in far simpler species (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>).

On page 921 of this issue, Burga <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show that scientists may have underestimated the contribution of protein-coding mutations to evolution.</p>

The cuboctahedra organize into pentagonal and hexagonal prismatic secondary structures, which then form tetrahedral and diamond quaternary topologies with unprecedented complexity. This packing results in the formation of colossal icosidodecahedral and rectified hexakaidecahedral cavities with internal diameters of 5.0 nanometers and 6.2 nanometers, respectively—ultimately giving rise to the lowest-density MOF reported to date.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-transporting protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small molecule–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron transport. They also suggest that small molecules that partially mimic the function of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

Lysosomal cholesterol activates mTORC1 via an SLC38A9–Niemann-Pick C1 signaling complex
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that becomes activated at the lysosome in response to nutrient cues. Here, we identify cholesterol, an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing block for cellular growth, as a nutrient input that drives mTORC1 recruitment and activation at the lysosomal surface. The lysosomal transmembrane protein, SLC38A9, is required for mTORC1 activation by cholesterol through conserved cholesterol-responsive motifs. Moreover, SLC38A9 enables mTORC1 activation by cholesterol independently from its arginine-sensing function. Conversely, the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, which regulates cholesterol export from the lysosome, binds to SLC38A9 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling through its sterol transport function. Thus, lysosomal cholesterol drives mTORC1 activation and growth signaling through the SLC38A9-NPC1 complex.</p>

Fat controls U
<p>Uridine (U) is a remarkably important molecule that is essential for a number of evolutionary and biological processes. It consists of the pyrimidine-analog uracil, which is linked to a ribose sugar. Uracil itself can be formed abiotically from pyrimidine, suggesting that this base is a central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing block of life. Uridine, by contrast, is a precursor for RNA, thus linking genetic information to the expression of proteins. Importantly, when phosphorylated to uridine triphosphate (UTP), it activates glucose to synthesize glycogen stores and thereby controls glucose metabolism. Uridine also has been implicated in neuron functions and brain processes. On page 1173 of this issue, Deng <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) offer transformative insights into the systemic regulation of circulating uridine and its actions in mammals, with implications for the potential of therapeutic uridine supplementation in general and new precision treatments of metabolic diseases in particular.</p>

Clathrate colloidal crystals
<p>DNA-programmable assembly has been used to deliberately synthesize hundreds of different colloidal crystals spanning dozens of symmetries, but the complexity of the achieved structures has so far been limited to small unit cells. We assembled DNA-modified triangular bipyramids (~250-nanometer long edge, 177-nanometer short edge) into clathrate architectures. Electron microscopy images revealed that at least three different structures form as large single-domain architectures or as multidomain materials. Ordered assemblies, isostructural to clathrates, were identified with the help of molecular simulations and geometric analysis. These structures are the most sophisticated architectures made via programmable assembly, and their formation can be understood based on the shape of the nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks and mode of DNA functionalization.</p>

Treadmilling by FtsZ filaments drives peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial cell division
<p>The mechanism by which bacteria divide is not well understood. Cell division is mediated by filaments of FtsZ and FtsA (FtsAZ) that recruit septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes to the division site. To understand how these components coordinate to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis. We found that the division septum was built at discrete sites that moved around the division plane. FtsAZ filaments treadmilled circumferentially around the division ring and drove the motions of the peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes. The FtsZ treadmilling rate controlled both the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing increasingly smaller concentric rings of peptidoglycan to divide the cell.</p>

Seagrass ecosystems reduce exposure to bacterial pathogens of humans, fishes, and invertebrates
<p>Plants are important in urban environments for removing pathogens and improving water quality. Seagrass meadows are the most widespread coastal ecosystem on the planet. Although these plants are known to be associated with natural biocide production, they have not been evaluated for their ability to remove microbiological contamination. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA gene, we found that when seagrass meadows are present, there was a 50% reduction in the relative abundance of potential bacterial pathogens capable of causing disease in humans and marine organisms. Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 reef-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold reductions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.</p>

Formation of α-chiral centers by asymmetric β-C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–H arylation, alkenylation, and alkynylation
<p>The enzymatic β-C–H hydroxylation of the feedstock chemical isobutyric acid has enabled the asymmetric synthesis of a wide variety of polyketides. The analogous transition metal–catalyzed enantioselective β-C–H functionalization of isobutyric acid–derived substrates should provide a versatile method for constructing useful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks with enantioenriched α-chiral centers from this abundant C-4 skeleton. However, the desymmetrization of ubiquitous isopropyl moieties by organometallic catalysts has remained an unanswered challenge.

We detail the enantioselective β-arylation, -alkenylation, and -alkynylation of isobutyric acid/2-aminoisobutyric acid derivatives, which may serve as a platform for the construction of α-chiral centers.</p>

A half-billion-dollar bid to head off emerging diseases
<p>In the wake of the Ebola crisis that erupted in West Africa in 2014, many public health leaders recognized that a more aggressive effort to develop vaccines could have moved a vaccine forward more quickly and prevented that outbreak from becoming an epidemic. A new organization was formed last year, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), to speed development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases—but it had no serious financial backing. Now, CEPI has attracted nearly a half-billion dollars in funding, as it planned to announce at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust each donated $100 million, and the governments of Norway, Japan, and Germany make up the balance. CEPI also decided to focus initially on three diseases—Lassa, Nipah, and Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus—and it will soon seek proposals from academia and industry to make these vaccines and conduct early phase trials so that they're at the ready for a real-word efficacy test when these pathogens emerge.</p>

Braiding a molecular knot with eight crossings
<p>Knots may ultimately prove just as versatile and useful at the nanoscale as at the macroscale. However, the lack of synthetic routes to all but the simplest molecular knots currently prevents systematic investigation of the influence of knotting at the molecular level. We found that it is possible to assemble four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks into three braided ligand strands. Octahedral iron(II) ions control the relative positions of the three strands at each crossing point in a circular triple helicate, while structural constraints on the ligands determine the braiding connections. This approach enables two-step assembly of a molecular 8<sub>19</sub> knot featuring eight nonalternating crossings in a 192-atom closed loop ~20 nanometers in length. The resolved metal-free 8<sub>19</sub> knot enantiomers have pronounced features in their circular dichroism spectra resulting solely from topological chirality.</p>

Emergence of hierarchical structural complexities in nanoparticles and their assembly
<p>We demonstrate that nanoparticle self-assembly can reach the same level of hierarchy, complexity, and accuracy as biomolecules. The precise assembly structures of gold nanoparticles (246 gold core atoms with 80 <i>p</i>-methylbenzenethiolate surface ligands) at the atomic, molecular, and nanoscale levels were determined from x-ray diffraction studies. We identified the driving forces and rules that guide the multiscale assembly behavior. The protecting ligands self-organize into rotational and parallel patterns on the nanoparticle surface via C-H⋅⋅⋅π interaction, and the symmetry and density of surface patterns dictate directional packing of nanoparticles into crystals with orientational, rotational, and translational orders.

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements

In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol formation by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

Leprosy in red squirrels

However, his attempts to cultivate the rod-shaped bacilli that he had observed in microscopic studies of tissues from leprosy patients were unsuccessful, emphasizing the unique growth requirements of these bacilli. Even today, <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i>, the causative organism of leprosy, cannot be grown on culture media, and many questions remain about its mode of transmission and epidemiology (<i>1</i>). The unexpected identification of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) as an extant animal reservoir of leprosy bacilli by Avanzi <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 744 of this issue elucidates the host conditions that may allow leprosy bacilli to multiply and cause disease.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ional to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest productivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities.</p>

Control of Cognate Sense mRNA Translation by cis-Natural Antisense RNAs
<p>Cis-Natural Antisense Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding genes and are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, constitute an important group of noncoding RNAs. Whereas several examples of cis-NATs regulating the expression of their cognate sense gene are known, most cis-NATs function by altering the steady-state level or structure of mRNA via changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or splicing, and very few cases involve the regulation of sense mRNA translation. This study was designed to systematically search for cis-NATs influencing cognate sense mRNA translation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Establishment of a pipeline relying on sequencing of total polyA<sup>+</sup> and polysomal RNA from Arabidopsis grown under various conditions (i.e. nutrient deprivation and phytohormone treatments) allowed the identification of 14 cis-NATs whose expression correlated either positively or negatively with cognate sense mRNA translation. With use of a combination of cis-NAT stable over-expression in transgenic plants and transient expression in protoplasts, the impact of cis-NAT expression on mRNA translation was confirmed for 4 out of 5 tested cis-NAT:sense mRNA pairs. These results expand the number of cis-NATs known to regulate cognate sense mRNA translation and provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion for future studies of their mode of action. Moreover, this study highlights the role of this class of noncoding RNAs in translation regulation.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 Recruits Histone Deacetylase and a Transcriptional Repression Complex to Regulate Rice Salt Tolerance
<p>Perception and transduction of salt stress signals are critical for plant survival, growth, and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the salt stress-signaling pathway is important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) molecular breeding of salt stress resistance. Here, we report the identification of an apetala2/ethylene response factor transcription factor INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of rice salt tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of salt tolerance in rice. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR assays and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-box-containing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic stress-responsive genes, including <i>LEA1</i> (<i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN1</i>) and <i>SOS1</i> (<i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i>), which are key genes regulating rice salt tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor topless-related 1 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> further defined the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates salt stress signaling as well as salt tolerance in rice.</p>

Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion of coral-reef ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can grow photoautotrophically, it can grow mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a metabolite normally transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and alterations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these physiological changes were correlated with changes in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little change in their abundances. However, the altered carbon metabolism in Glc-supplemented cells was correlated with modest alterations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy metabolism and cellular physiology, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic physiological changes that are not reflected by major changes in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably reflect posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

The DnaJ-Like Zinc-Finger Protein HCF222 Is Required for Thylakoid Membrane Biogenesis in Plants
<p>To understand the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane in higher plants and to identify auxiliary proteins required to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> up this highly complex membrane system, we have characterized the allelic nuclear mutants <i>high chlorophyll fluorescence222-1</i> (<i>hcf222-1</i>) and <i>hcf222-2</i> and isolated the causal gene by map-based cloning. In the ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant <i>hcf222-1</i>, the accumulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> (Cytb6f) complex was reduced to 30% compared with the wild type. Other thylakoid membrane complexes accumulated to normal levels. The T-DNA knockout mutant <i>hcf222-2</i> showed a more severe defect with respect to thylakoid membrane proteins and accumulated only 10% of the Cytb6f complex, accompanied by a reduction in photosystem II, the photosystem II light-harvesting complex, and photosystem I. <i>HCF222</i> encodes a protein of 99 amino acids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that has similarities to the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ chaperones. The insulin precipitation assay demonstrated that HCF222 has disulfide reductase activity in vitro. The protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in algae and cyanobacteria. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that a fraction of HCF222-green fluorescent protein was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum but that it also could be recognized in chloroplasts. A fusion construct of HCF222 containing a plastid transit peptide targets the protein into chloroplasts and was able to complement the mutational defect. These findings indicate that the chloroplast-targeted HCF222 is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the Cytb6f complex and is very likely involved in thiol-disulfide biochemistry at the thylakoid membrane.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, genomes of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative genomics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume genomes as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these genomes and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated genomic fractionation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion for further genomics exploration in the legume research community and beyond.

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino acids are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino acids serve as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino acids (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino acids have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino acid metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino acid transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino acid and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Profiles of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. Unaltered by Heat Stress in a Coral Host
<p>Dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> form an endosymbiosis with reef <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing corals, in which photosynthetically derived nutrients comprise the majority of the coral energy budget. An extraordinary amount of functional and genetic diversity is contained within the coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> with some phylotypes (i.e., genotypic groupings), conferring enhanced stress tolerance to host corals. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of the stress response of the cnidarian coral host; however, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular response to stress of coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> as well as differences among physiologically susceptible and tolerant types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the transcriptome-wide response to heat stress via RNA-Seq of two types of <i>Symbiodinium,</i> the putatively thermotolerant type D2 and the more susceptible type C3K, resident within the same coral host species, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i>. Contrary to previous findings with coral hosts, we find no detectable change in gene expression across the dinoflagellate transcriptome after 3 days of elevated thermal exposure, despite physical evidence of symbiosis breakdown. However, hundreds of genes identified as orthologs between the C and D types exhibited significant expression differences within treatments (i.e., attributable solely to type, not heat exposure). These include many genes related to known thermotolerance mechanisms including heat shock proteins and chloroplast membrane components. Additionally, both the between-treatment similarities and between-type differences remained pervasive after 12–18 months of common garden acclimation and in mixed <i>Symbiodinium</i> assemblages within the same coral host colony.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence.

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">floor</span></strong>-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

Outcomes Associated With Extraction Versus Capping and Abandoning Pacing and Defibrillator Leads
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Lead management is an increasingly important aspect of care in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices; however, relatively little is known about long-term outcomes after capping and abandoning leads.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using the 5% Medicare sample, we identified patients with de novo cardiac implantable electronic device implantations between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, and with a subsequent lead addition or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion ≥12 months after the de novo implantation. Patients who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion for infection were excluded. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we compared cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality, device-related infection, device revision, and lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion at 1 and 5 years for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion versus the cap and abandon group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 6859 patients, 1113 (16.2%) underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion, whereas 5746 (83.8%) underwent capping and abandonment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion patients tended to be younger (median, 78 versus 79 years; <i>P</i><0.0001), were less likely to be male (65% versus 68%; <i>P</i>=0.05), and had shorter lead dwell time (median, 3.0 versus 4.0 years; <i>P</i><0.0001) and fewer comorbidities. Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years (25th, 75th percentiles, 1.0, 4.3 years), the overall 1-year and 5-year cumulative incidence of mortality was 13.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.7–14.4) and 54.3% (95% CI, 52.8–55.8), respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion was associated with a lower risk of device infection at 5 years relative to capping (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.97; <i>P</i>=0.027). There was no association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion and mortality, lead revision, or lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion at 5 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Elective lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion for noninfectious indications had similar long-term survival to that for capping and abandoning leads in a Medicare population. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion was associated with lower risk of device infections at 5 years.</p></sec>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Validating Utility of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Score in a Large Pooled Cohort From 3 Japanese Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Studies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) score was developed to estimate ischemic and bleeding risks from the DAPT study.

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations.</p>

Dissolved organic sulfur in the ocean: Biogeochemistry of a petagram inventory
<p>Although sulfur is an essential element for marine primary production and critical for climate processes, little is known about the oceanic pool of nonvolatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissolv</span></strong>ed organic sulfur (DOS). We present a basin-scale distribution of solid-phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>able DOS in the East Atlantic Ocean and the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Although molar DOS versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissolv</span></strong>ed organic nitrogen (DON) ratios of 0.11 ± 0.024 in Atlantic surface water resembled phytoplankton stoichiometry (sulfur/nitrogen ~ 0.08), increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissolv</span></strong>ed organic carbon (DOC) versus DOS ratios and decreasing methionine-S yield demonstrated selective DOS removal and active involvement in marine biogeochemical cycles. Based on stoichiometric estimates, the minimum global inventory of marine DOS is 6.7 petagrams of sulfur, exceeding all other marine organic sulfur reservoirs by an order of magnitude.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>s ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ing them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong> budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ing budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression.

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The SWNT network physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the atomically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic molecules, and they retain stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation performance in tubular modules.</p>

Zeolitic imidazolate framework membranes made by ligand-induced permselectivation
<p>Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes are emerging as a promising energy-efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation technology. However, their reliable and scalable manufacturing remains a challenge. We demonstrate the fabrication of ZIF nanocomposite membranes by means of an all-vapor-phase processing method based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO in a porous support followed by ligand-vapor treatment. After ALD, the obtained nanocomposite exhibits low flux and is not selective, whereas after ligand-vapor (2-methylimidazole) treatment, it is partially transformed to ZIF and shows stable performance with high mixture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation factor for propylene over propane (an energy-intensive high-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation) and high propylene flux.

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. These results demonstrated that the DNA-induced phase transition of cGAS promotes cGAMP production and innate immune signaling.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>s. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Heterohexamers Formed by CcmK3 and CcmK4 Increase the Complexity of Beta Carboxysome Shells
<p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) encapsulate enzymes within a selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e, proteinaceous shell. Carboxysomes are BMCs containing ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase that enhance carbon dioxide fixation. The carboxysome shell consists of three structurally characterized protein types, each named after the oligomer they form: BMC-H (hexamer), BMC-P (pentamer), and BMC-T (trimer). These three protein types form cyclic homooligomers with pores at the center of symmetry that enable metabolite transport across the shell. Carboxysome shells contain multiple BMC-H paralogs, each with distinctly conserved residues surrounding the pore, which are assumed to be associated with specific metabolites. We studied the regulation of β-carboxysome shell composition by investigating the BMC-H genes <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> situated in a locus remote from other carboxysome genes. We made single and double deletion mutants of <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> in <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 and show that, unlike CcmK3, CcmK4 is necessary for optimal growth. In contrast to other CcmK proteins, CcmK3 does not form homohexamers; instead CcmK3 forms heterohexamers with CcmK4 with a 1:2 stoichiometry. The CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers form stacked dodecamers in a pH-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers potentially expand the range of permeability properties of metabolite channels in carboxysome shells. Moreover, the observed facultative formation of dodecamers in solution suggests that carboxysome shell permeability may be dynamically attenuated by “capping” facet-embedded hexamers with a second hexamer. Because β-carboxysomes are obligately expressed, heterohexamer formation and capping could provide a rapid and reversible means to alter metabolite flux across the shell in response to environmental/growth conditions.</p>

Plasma Membrane-Type Aquaporins from Marine Diatoms Function as CO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub> Channels and Provide Photoprotection
<p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are ubiquitous water channels that facilitate the transport of many small molecules and may play multiple vital roles in aquatic environments. In particular, mechanisms to maintain transmembrane fluxes of important small molecules have yet to be studied in marine photoautotrophic organisms. Here, we report the occurrence of multiple AQPs with differential cellular localizations in marine diatoms, an important group of oceanic primary producers. The AQPs play a role in mediating the permeability of membranes to CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>. In silico surveys revealed the presence of five AQP orthologs in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> and two in the centric diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i>. GFP fusions of putative AQPs displayed clear localization to the plasma membrane (PtAGP1 and PtAQP2), the chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (CER; PtAGP1 and PtAQP3), and the tonoplast (PtAQP5) in <i>P. tricornutum</i>. In <i>T. pseudonana</i>, GFP-AQP fusion proteins were found on the vacuole membrane (TpAQP1) and CER (TpAQP2). Transcript levels of both <i>PtAQP1</i> and <i>PtAQP2</i> were highly induced by ammonia, while only <i>PtAQP2</i> was induced by high (1%[v/v]) CO<sub>2</sub>. Constitutive overexpression of GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 significantly increased CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in <i>P. tricornutum</i>, strongly indicating that these AQPs function in regulating CO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in the plasma membrane and/or CER. Cells carrying GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 had higher nonphotochemical quenching under high light relative to that of wild-type cells, suggesting that these AQPs are involved in photoprotection. These AQPs may facilitate the efflux of NH<sub>3</sub>, preventing the uncoupling effect of high intracellular ammonia concentrations.</p>

Developmental Changes in Scots Pine Transcriptome during Heartwood Formation
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) wood is desired in woodworking industries due to its favorable timber characteristics and natural durability that is contributed by heartwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ives. It has been discussed whether the Scots pine heartwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ives (mainly stilbenes and resin acids) are synthesized in the cells of the transition zone between sapwood and heartwood, or if they are transported from the sapwood. Timing of heartwood formation during the yearly cycle has also not been unambiguously defined. We measured steady-state mRNA levels in Scots pine transition zone and sapwood using RNA sequencing. Year-round expression profiles of selected transcripts were further investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. Differentially accumulating transcripts suggest that, of the Scots pine heartwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ives, stilbenes are synthesized in situ in the transition zone and gain their carbon-skeletons from Suc and triglycerides. Resin acids, on the other hand, are synthesized early in the spring mainly in the sapwood, meaning that they must be transported to the heartwood transition zone. Heartwood formation is marked by programmed cell death that occurs during the summer months in the transition zone.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%).

Phase separation focuses DNA sensing
<p>The presence of any double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol is a potent trigger for the activation of innate immune responses. In the context of an infection, immunorecognition of “foreign” dsDNA serves as a central host strategy to detect the presence of pathogens. Under certain conditions, however, sensing of aberrant cytosolic self-dsDNA can also promote destructive inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases. A fundamental question is how cells spatially organize and biochemically regulate the recognition of intracellular dsDNA in the vast cytosolic space of a cell. On page 704 in this issue, Du and Chen (<i>1</i>) introduce an elegant explanation by demonstrating that phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the dsDNA sensor cGAS [cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate)–AMP (adenosine monophosphate) synthase] enables this central task.

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger waves. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>s and observed apoptotic trigger waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the waves. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger waves in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>s and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger waves in cell signaling.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins

Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate the cavities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base.

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%

We demonstrate PSCs that achieve stabilized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal stability under long-term heating, although their operational stability was poor. This instability originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the stability of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins
<p>Fast water transport through carbon nanotube pores has raised the possibility to use them in the next generation of water treatment technologies.

Intermolecular hydrogen-bond rearrangement, required for entry into the nanotube, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance water transport rates. CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed seawater levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic diodes.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Controlling guest conformation for efficient purification of butadiene
<p>Conventional adsorbents preferentially adsorb the small, high-polarity, and unsaturated 1,3-butadiene molecule over the other C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbons from which it must be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated.

In a breakthrough operation at ambient temperature and pressure, this guest conformation–controlling adsorbent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ed 1,3-butadiene first, then butane, butene, and isobutene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene can be efficiently purified (≥99.5%) while avoiding high-temperature conditions that can lead to its undesirable polymerization.</p>

ATP controls the crowd
<p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the canonical energy carrier that powers cellular machines, drives metabolic reactions, and serves as a precursor to nucleic acids. On page 753 of this issue, Patel <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) propose a previously unknown function for ATP in maintaining protein solubility and preventing macromolecular aggregation. They show that at physiologic concentrations (2 to 8 mM), the physical properties of ATP alone enable it to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissolv</span></strong>e liquid-liquid phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets and amyloid fibers. These findings suggest an additional way for cells to use ATP to maintain proteostasis in the crowded cytoplasm and also fine-tune the material properties of nonmembrane-bound organelles and the cell interior in general.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the melting point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form basaltic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissolv</span></strong>ed in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissolv</span></strong>ed hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling geophysical observations of the melting regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Formaldehyde stabilization facilitates lignin monomer production during biomass depolymerization
<p>Practical, high-yield lignin depolymerization methods could greatly increase biorefinery productivity and profitability. However, development of these methods is limited by the presence of interunit carbon-carbon bonds within native lignin, and further by formation of such linkages during lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion. We report that adding formaldehyde during biomass pretreatment produces a soluble lignin fraction that can be converted to guaiacyl and syringyl monomers at near theoretical yields during subsequent hydrogenolysis (47 mole % of Klason lignin for beech and 78 mole % for a high-syringyl transgenic poplar). These yields were three to seven times those obtained without formaldehyde, which prevented lignin condensation by forming 1,3-dioxane structures with lignin side-chain hydroxyl groups. By depolymerizing cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately, monomer yields were between 76 and 90 mole % for these three major biomass fractions.</p>

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ion procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ed from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extract</span></strong>ed maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flush</span></strong> the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

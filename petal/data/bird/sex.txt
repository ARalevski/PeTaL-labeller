Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (XX) versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> (XY) sex chromosome complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex chromosome complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex chromosome complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. AAAs from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Moreover, aortas from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex chromosome complement in phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs. Sex chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for sex-specific AAA therapeutics.</p></sec>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones, we were able to deduce whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> recognition template for conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>, and especially the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e, but that contained a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-like features, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e. Taken together, our data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e identification when a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes that become “co-opted” by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, we screened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s that is transferred to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-expressed paralog had no significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es by acting on a common, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed target. After duplication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p>Sexual competition among dioecious plants affects sex ratios and the spatial distribution of the sexes in different environments. At present, little is known about sexual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate sex-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, or one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drive</span></strong>n differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive ability between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es subjected to intrasexual competition were observed, although the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es was moderately greater under intersexual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the sex differences in competitive ability, especially under intersexual competition. Under salinity stress, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under intersexual competition. In addition, salt-stressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s growing intermixed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under salt stress can importantly affect the sex ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are significant sexual differences in the morphological and physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder under stressful conditions. However, little is known about sex-specific differences in responses to nutrient deficiencies. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies on the morphological, physiological and chloroplast ultrastructural traits of <i>P. cathayana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were investigated. The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both sexes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher photosynthesis, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in chloroplasts than did <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es when exposed to N- and P-deficiency conditions. Nitrogen-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher glutamate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities, and a more intact chloroplast ultrastructure, but less starch accumulation than did N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Phosphorus-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s had higher nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and acid phosphatase activities, but a lower foliar N : P ratio and less PSII damage than did P-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These results suggest that N and P deficiencies cause greater negative effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es than on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, and that the different sexes of <i>P. cathayana</i> may employ different strategies to cope with N and P deficiencies.</p>

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome
<p>The red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, follows an XX (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e) and XY (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>) sex determination system. Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX insects to follow the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sex determination in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (XX) that are fertile. The virgin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es mated with these masculinized genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es produced all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sex determination is present on the Y chromosome. These data also suggest that the Y chromosome in <i>T. castaneum</i> is not required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> fertility.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e genes reveals distinct vegetative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Problem-solving males become more attractive to female budgerigars
<p>Darwin proposed that mate choice might contribute to the evolution of cognitive abilities. An open question is whether observing the cognitive skills of an individual makes it more attractive as a mate. In this study, we demonstrated that initially less-preferred budgerigar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s became preferred after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es observed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s, but not the initially preferred ones, were able to solve extractive foraging problems. This preference shift did not occur in control experiments in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s with free access to food or in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e demonstrators solving these extractive foraging problems. Our results suggest that direct observation of problem-solving skills increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> attractiveness and that this could contribute to the evolution of the cognitive abilities underlying such skills.</p>

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pattern of the reproductive system is established by default because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium was responsible for the retention of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian ducts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian duct maintenance.</p>

Down-regulation of the Sucrose Transporter <i>CsSUT1</i> Causes Male Sterility by Altering Carbohydrate Supply
<p>In plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility, but it remains unclear whether Suc transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-affinity Suc-H<sup>+</sup> symporter. <i>CsSUT1</i> is expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen, and companion cells of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments, and pedicel. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flowers of <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNA interference (RNAi) lines exhibited a decrease in Suc, hexose, and starch content, relative to those of the wild type, during the later stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> flower development, a finding that was highly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport, and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most <i>myeloblastosis</i> (<i>MYB</i>) transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNAi lines relative to wild type. Our findings demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <i>CsSUT1</i> expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific <i>MYB</i> transcription factors. This knowledge provides a new approach for bioengineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility in crop plants.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e or embryo, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly documented that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic development, the original compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es by micromanipulation, the enucleolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing embryos. After removal of NPBs from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not used in embryonic development and that the nucleoli in developing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s were quicker to court <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal contamination, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s improved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-contaminated soils.</p>

Gibberellin Induces Diploid Pollen Formation by Interfering with Meiotic Cytokinesis
<p>The plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) controls many physiological processes, including cell differentiation, cell elongation, seed germination, and response to abiotic stress. In this study, we report that exogenous treatment of flowering Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with GA specifically affects the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis leading to meiotic restitution and the production of diploid (2n) pollen grains. Similar defects in meiotic cell division and reproductive ploidy stability occur in Arabidopsis plants depleted of RGA and GAI, two members of the DELLA family that function as suppressor of GA signaling. Cytological analysis of the double <i>rga-24 gai-t6</i> mutant revealed that defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis are not caused by alterations in meiosis I (MI or meiosis II (MII) chromosome dynamics, but instead result from aberrations in the spatial organization of the phragmoplast-like radial microtubule arrays (RMAs) at the end of meiosis II. In line with a role for GA in the genetic regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproductive system, we additionally show that DELLA downstream targets MYB33 and MYB65 are redundantly required for functional RMA biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cytokinesis. By analyzing the expression of <i>pRGA::GFP-RGA</i> in the wild-type Landsberg <i>erecta</i> background, we demonstrate that the GFP-RGA protein is specifically expressed in the anther cell layers surrounding the meiocytes and microspores, suggesting that appropriate GA signaling in the somatic anther tissue is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> meiotic cell wall formation and thus plays an important role in consolidating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> gametophytic ploidy consistency.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s fighting. We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, a shallower gradient was observed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es as compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Ductal sex determination
<p>How the physical differences between the sexes develop is an intriguing process. In mammals, the first important stage in sex determination occurs during fetal life, when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-determining Y chromosome expresses a gene called <i>sex determining region Y</i> (<i>SRY</i>), which acts on the bipotential gonad to initiate testis (instead of ovary) formation (<i>1</i>). Landmark experiments by Jost in the 1950s showed that the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-specific structures is established by factors produced from the emerging testis, namely androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (<i>2</i>). This suggested that the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> characteristics is an active process, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific differentiation is passive. On page 717 of this issue, Zhao <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e development is also an active process.</p>

Male sex in houseflies is determined by <i>Mdmd</i>, a paralog of the generic splice factor gene <i>CWC22</i>
<p>Across species, animals have diverse sex determination pathways, each consisting of a hierarchical cascade of genes and its associated regulatory mechanism. Houseflies have a distinctive polymorphic sex determination system in which a dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> determiner, the M-factor, can reside on any of the chromosomes. We identified a gene, <i>Musca domestica</i> <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> determiner</i> (<i>Mdmd</i>), as the M-factor. <i>Mdmd</i> originated from a duplication of the spliceosomal factor gene <i>CWC22</i> (<i>nucampholin</i>). Targeted <i>Mdmd</i> disruption results in complete sex reversal to fertile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es because of a shift from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e expression of the downstream genes <i>transformer</i> and <i>doublesex</i>. The presence of <i>Mdmd</i> on different chromosomes indicates that <i>Mdmd</i> translocated to different genomic sites. Thus, an instructive signal in sex determination can arise by duplication and neofunctionalization of an essential splicing regulator.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable heat-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones generated heat even in cool weather conditions. Fe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones produced heat, but to a lesser extent than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates seed development immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of seed development after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed development.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p>Temperature-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient temperature during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits temperature-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a temperature at which all offspring develop into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s) triggers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

Rapid genome shrinkage in a self-fertile nematode reveals sperm competition proteins
<p>To reveal impacts of sexual mode on genome content, we compared chromosome-scale assemblies of the outcrossing nematode <i>Caenorhabditis nigoni</i> to its self-fertile sibling species, <i>C. briggsae</i>. <i>C. nigoni</i>’s genome resembles that of outcrossing relatives but encodes 31% more protein-coding genes than <i>C. briggsae</i>. <i>C. nigoni</i> genes lacking <i>C. briggsae</i> orthologs were disproportionately small and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-biased in expression. These include the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> secreted short </i>(<i>mss</i>) gene family, which encodes sperm surface glycoproteins conserved only in outcrossing species. Sperm from <i>mss</i>-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s of outcrossing <i>C. remanei</i> failed to compete with wild-type sperm, despite normal fertility in noncompetitive mating. Restoring <i>mss</i> to <i>C. briggsae</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s was sufficient to enhance sperm competitiveness. Thus, sex has a pervasive influence on genome content that can be used to identify sperm competition factors.</p>

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for transmission through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their transmission through a process known as meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drive</span></strong>. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis, selfish elements <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drive</span></strong> by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drive</span></strong>rs exploit the asymmetry inherent in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis to bias their transmission.</p>

Changes in the microbiota cause genetically modified <i>Anopheles</i> to spread in a population
<p>The mosquito’s innate immune system controls both <i>Plasmodium</i> and bacterial infections. We investigated the competitiveness of mosquitoes genetically modified to alter expression of their own anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> immune genes in a mixed-cage population with wild-type mosquitoes. We observed that genetically modified mosquitoes with increased immune activity in the midgut tissue did not have an observed fitness disadvantage and showed reduced microbial loads in both the midgut and reproductive organs. These changes result in a mating preference of genetically modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s for wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, whereas wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>s prefer genetically modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.

Arabidopsis <i>PIRL6</i> Is Essential for Male and Female Gametogenesis and Is Regulated by Alternative Splicing
<p>Plant intracellular Ras-group leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins (PIRLs) are related to Ras-interacting animal LRR proteins that participate in developmental cell signaling. Systematic knockout analysis has implicated some members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>PIRL</i> family in pollen development. However, for <i>PIRL6</i>, no bona fide knockout alleles have been recovered, suggesting that it may have an essential function in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophytes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated <i>PIRL6</i> expression and induced knockdown by RNA interference. Knockdown triggered defects in gametogenesis, resulting in abnormal pollen and early developmental arrest in the embryo sac. Consistent with this, <i>PIRL6</i> was expressed in gametophytes: functional transcripts were detected in wild-type flowers but not in <i>sporocyteless</i> (<i>spl</i>) mutant flowers, which do not produce gametophytes. A genomic PIRL6-GFP fusion construct confirmed expression in both pollen and the embryo sac. Interestingly, <i>PIRL6</i> is part of a convergent overlapping gene pair, a scenario associated with an increased likelihood of alternative splicing. We detected multiple alternative <i>PIRL6</i> mRNAs in vegetative organs and <i>spl</i> mutant flowers, tissues that lacked the functionally spliced transcript. cDNA sequencing revealed that all contained intron sequences and premature termination codons. These alternative mRNAs accumulated in the nonsense-mediated decay mutant <i>upf3</i>, indicating that they are normally subjected to degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that <i>PIRL6</i> is required in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametogenesis and suggest that sporophytic expression is negatively regulated by unproductive alternative splicing. This posttranscriptional mechanism may function to minimize PIRL6 protein expression in sporophyte tissues while allowing the overlapping adjacent gene to remain widely transcribed.</p>

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p>Pollen tube guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduction. The pollen tube that grows from pollen, which is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> gametophyte, precisely navigates to the embryo sac, which is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic pollen tube guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the pollen tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic pollen tube guidance is reviewed, including attraction by synergid cells, control of pollen tube guidance by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametes, and directional growth of the pollen tube by directional cue sensing.

A Conserved cis-Regulatory Module Determines Germline Fate through Activation of the Transcription Factor DUO1 Promoter
<p>The development of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> germline within pollen relies upon the activation of numerous target genes by the transcription factor DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). The expression of DUO1 is restricted to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> germline and is first detected shortly after the asymmetric division that segregates the germ cell lineage. Transcriptional regulation is critical in controlling DUO1 expression, since transcriptional and translational fusions show similar expression patterns. Here, we identify key promoter sequences required for the germline-specific regulation of <i>DUO1</i> transcription. Combining promoter deletion analyses with phylogenetic footprinting in eudicots and in Arabidopsis accessions, we identify a cis-regulatory module, <i>Regulatory region of DUO1</i> (<i>ROD1</i>), which replicates the expression pattern of <i>DUO1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We show that <i>ROD1</i> from the legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i> directs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> germline-specific expression in Arabidopsis, demonstrating conservation of DUO1 regulation among eudicots. <i>ROD1</i> contains several short conserved cis-regulatory elements, including three copies of the motif DNGTGGV, required for germline expression and tandem repeats of the motif YAACYGY, which enhance <i>DUO1</i> transcription in a positive feedback loop. We conclude that a cis-regulatory module conserved in eudicots directs the spatial and temporal expression of the transcription factor DUO1 to specify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> germline fate and sperm cell differentiation.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation
<p>Anther cuticle and pollen exine are protective barriers for pollen development and fertilization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), few genes have been characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-sterile mutant in maize, <i>irregular pollen exine1</i> (<i>ipe1</i>), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective pollen exine. Using map-based cloning, the <i>IPE1</i> gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine development together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> STERILITY26 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> STERILITY45 in maize.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high sequence identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> competition. Using various types of massively parallel sequencing data, we studied the organization, sequence evolution, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read sequencing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

The Evolution of Male–Female Sexual Dimorphism Predates the Gender-Based Divergence of the Mating Locus Gene <i>MAT3/RB</i>
<p>The molecular bases for the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sexual dimorphism are possible to study in volvocine algae because they encompass the entire range of reproductive morphologies from isogamy to oogamy. In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene becoming linked to the sex-determining or mating type locus (<i>MT</i>) as a mechanism for the evolution of anisogamy. Here, we carried out the first comprehensive study of a candidate <i>MT-</i>linked oogamy gene, <i>MAT3/RB</i>, across the volvocine lineage. We found that evolution of anisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e divergence of <i>MAT3</i> that characterizes the <i>Volvox carteri</i> lineage. These data demonstrate very little sex-linked sequence divergence of <i>MAT3</i> between the two sexes in other volvocine groups, though linkage between <i>MAT3</i> and the mating locus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants other than or in addition to <i>MAT3</i> in the evolution of anisogamy in volvocine algae.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.</p>

Phenotypic rescue of a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mitochondrial ANT1 disease
<p>A point mutation in the <i>Drosophila</i> gene that codes for the major adult isoform of adenine nuclear translocase (ANT) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [<i>stress-sensitive B<sup>1</sup></i> (<i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i>)]. We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to sound, defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> courtship, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sterility and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mitoribosomal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their eggs, although fertilized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drive</span></strong> multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drive</span></strong> bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers <i>en route</i> to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> pollen tube integrity and sperm release are regulated by RALF-mediated signaling
<p>In flowering plants, fertilization requires complex cell-to-cell communication events between the pollen tube and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive tissues, which are controlled by extracellular signaling molecules interacting with receptors at the pollen tube surface. We found that two such receptors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, BUPS1 and BUPS2, and their peptide ligands, RALF4 and RALF19, are pollen tube–expressed and are required to maintain pollen tube integrity. BUPS1 and BUPS2 interact with receptors ANXUR1 and ANXUR2 via their ectodomains, and both sets of receptors bind RALF4 and RALF19. These receptor-ligand interactions are in competition with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-derived ligand RALF34, which induces pollen tube bursting at nanomolar concentrations. We propose that RALF34 replaces RALF4 and RALF19 at the interface of pollen tube–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametophyte contact, thereby deregulating BUPS-ANXUR signaling and in turn leading to pollen tube rupture and sperm release.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which plants activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e adults of a destructive rice pest, brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, irMAPK plants wilted earlier than wild-type plants, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK plants. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK plants displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed planthopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying post<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

<i>Defective Pollen Wall 2</i> (<i>DPW2</i>) Encodes an Acyl Transferase Required for Rice Pollen Development
<p>Aliphatic and aromatic lipids are both essential structural components of the plant cuticle, an important interface between the plant and environment. Although cross links between aromatic and aliphatic or other moieties are known to be associated with the formation of leaf cutin and root and seed suberin, the contribution of aromatic lipids to the biosynthesis of anther cuticles and pollen walls remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterile mutant, <i>defective pollen wall 2</i> (<i>dpw2</i>), which showed an abnormal anther cuticle, a defective pollen wall, and complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility. Compared with the wild type, <i>dpw2</i> anthers have increased amounts of cutin and waxes and decreased levels of lipidic and phenolic compounds. <i>DPW2</i> encodes a cytoplasmically localized BAHD acyltransferase. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant DPW2 specifically transfers hydroxycinnamic acid moieties, using ω-hydroxy fatty acids as acyl acceptors and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs as acyl donors. Thus, The cytoplasmic hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:ω-hydroxy fatty acid transferase DPW2 plays a fundamental role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproduction via the biosynthesis of key components of the anther cuticle and pollen wall.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Sex differences in the utilization of essential and non-essential amino acids in Lepidoptera
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">male</span></strong> moths oxidize greater amounts of larva-derived amino acids than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, and more nectar-derived amino acids after feeding. Under starvation conditions, adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es exhibit the opposite pattern.</p>

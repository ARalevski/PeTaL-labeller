Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed ionic state. The initial condition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins designed using this code and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein folding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization, and evolution.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

Near-atomic model of microtubule-tau interactions
<p>Tau is a developmentally regulated axonal protein that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes and bundles microtubules (MTs). Its hyperphosphorylation is thought to cause detachment from MTs and subsequent aggregation into fibrils implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. It is unclear which tau residues are crucial for tau-MT interactions, where tau binds on MTs, and how it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes them. We used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize different tau constructs on MTs and computational approaches to generate atomic models of tau-tubulin interactions. The conserved tubulin-binding repeats within tau adopt similar extended structures along the crest of the protofilament, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing the interface between tubulin dimers. Our structures explain the effect of phosphorylation on MT affinity and lead to a model of tau repeats binding in tandem along protofilaments, tethering together tubulin dimers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing polymerization interfaces.</p>

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic hole-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity under long-term heating, although their operational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity was poor. This in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysis via direct photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids.

Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation
<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the control of histone modification and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and lung injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of CBP reduced the extent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in mouse lung epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14. Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and attenuated LPS-stimulated histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms through which CBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is regulated by FBXL19 and USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>

Methylammonium-free, high-performance, and stable perovskite solar cells on a planar architecture
<p>Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performances greater than 20% contain bromine (Br), causing a suboptimal bandgap, and the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. Avoiding Br and especially MA can therefore result in more optimal bandgaps and stable perovskites. We show that inorganic cation tuning, using rubidium and cesium, enables highly crystalline formamidinium-based perovskites without Br or MA. On a conventional, planar device architecture, using polymeric interlayers at the electron- and hole-transporting interface, we demonstrate an efficiency of 20.35% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized), one of the highest for MA-free perovskites, with a drastically improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity reached without the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing influence of mesoporous interlayers. The perovskite is not heated beyond 100°C. Going MA-free is a new direction for perovskites that are inherently stable and compatible with tandems or flexible substrates, which are the main routes commercializing PSCs.</p>

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry. This reaction was investigated with quantum state specificity by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of the vinylidene anions H<sub>2</sub>CC and D<sub>2</sub>CC and quantum dynamics calculations. Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character.

Distinct phases of Polycomb silencing to hold epigenetic memory of cold in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Gene silencing by Polycomb complexes is central to eukaryotic development. Cold-induced epigenetic repression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) in the plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides an opportunity to study initiation and maintenance of Polycomb silencing. Here, we show that a subset of Polycomb repressive complex 2 factors nucleate silencing in a small region within <i>FLC</i>, locally increasing H3K27me3 levels. This nucleation confers a silenced state that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metast</span></strong>ably inherited, with memory held in the local chromatin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metast</span></strong>able memory is then converted to stable epigenetic silencing through separate Polycomb factors, which spread across the locus after cold to enlarge the domain that contains H3K27me3.

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations.

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer
<p>Relatively few catalytic systems are able to control the stereochemistry of electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed organic intermediates. Here we report the discovery that a chiral Lewis acid complex can catalyze triplet energy transfer from an electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed photosensitizer. We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced electron transfer and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate. We expect that this approach will enable chemists to more broadly apply their detailed understanding of chiral Lewis acid catalysis to stereocontrol in reactions involving electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed states.</p>

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of MLA immune receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

In situ immunofluorescence of heart tissue sections demonstrated significant disorganization of junctophilin-2 (JP2), a protein that bridges the T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, in transaortic banded hearts as well as in human failing hearts, whereas colchicine injection significantly preserved the distribution of JP2 in transaortic banded hearts. In isolated mouse cardiomyocytes, prolonged culture or treatment with taxol resulted in pronounced redistribution of JP2 from T-tubules to the peripheral plasma membrane, without changing total JP2 expression. Nocodazole treatment antagonized JP2 redistribution. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of kinesin 1, a microtubule motor protein responsible for anterograde trafficking of proteins, protected against JP2 redistribution and T-tubule remodeling in culture.

<i>C1orf106</i> is a colitis risk gene that regulates stability of epithelial adherens junctions
<p>Polymorphisms in <i>C1orf106</i> are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence time defines the clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral precision goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a precision in frequency estimation scaling in time <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses.

Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids.

Visualizing dynamic microvillar search and stabilization during ligand detection by T cells
<p>During immune surveillance, T cells survey the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In searching for peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs), they must solve a classic trade-off between speed and sensitivity. It has long been supposed that microvilli on T cells act as sensory organs to enable search, but their strategy has been unknown. We used lattice light-sheet and quantum dot–enabled synaptic contact mapping microscopy to show that anomalous diffusion and fractal organization of microvilli survey the majority of opposing surfaces within 1 minute.

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators
<p>Topological crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline symmetry leads to topologically protected surface states with a chiral spin texture, rendering them potential candidates for spintronics applications. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of one-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic surface step edges of the three-dimensional topological crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and protects them from backscattering.

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity through the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are sites of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the degradation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 degradation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from degradation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for degradation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 protein levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify proteins that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) protein family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB proteins have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for protein complex formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 protein levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated protein PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Phosphorylation of Arabidopsis MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) Is Required for PAMP Responses and Resistance against Bacteria
<p>Plants perceive potential pathogens via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern recognition receptors, which initiates a series of intracellular responses that ultimately limit bacterial growth. PAMP responses include changes in intracellular protein phosphorylation, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), such as Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MKP1, are important negative regulators of MAPKs and play a crucial role in controlling the intensity and duration of MAPK activation during innate immune signaling. As such, the <i>mkp1</i> mutant lacking MKP1 displays enhanced PAMP responses and resistance against the virulent bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Previous in vitro studies showed that MKP1 can be phosphorylated and activated by MPK6, suggesting that phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for regulating MKP1. We found that MKP1 was phosphorylated during PAMP elicitation and that phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized the protein, resulting in protein accumulation after elicitation. MKP1 also can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that MKP1 is constitutively degraded through the proteasome in the resting state. In addition, we investigated the role of MKP1 posttranslational regulation in plant defense by testing whether phenotypes of the <i>mkp1</i> Arabidopsis mutant could be complemented by expressing phosphorylation site mutations of MKP1. The phosphorylation of MKP1 was found to be required for some, but not all, of MKP1’s functions in PAMP responses and defense against bacteria. Together, our results provide insight into the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of MKP1 during PAMP signaling and resistance to bacteria.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

The RING-Type E3 Ligase XBAT35.2 Is Involved in Cell Death Induction and Pathogen Response
<p>XBAT35 belongs to a subfamily of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RING-type E3s that are similar in domain architecture to the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) XA21 Binding Protein3, a defense protein. The <i>XBAT35</i> transcript undergoes alternative splicing to produce two protein isoforms, XBAT35.1 and XBAT35.2. Here, we demonstrate that XBAT35.2 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and is involved in cell death induction and pathogen response. XBAT35.2, but not XBAT35.1, was found to trigger cell death when overexpressed in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and does so in a manner that requires its RING domain. Loss of <i>XBAT35</i> gene function disrupts the plant’s ability to defend against pathogen attack, whereas overexpression of <i>XBAT35.2</i> enhances resistance to pathogens. XBAT35.2 was found to be unstable and promotes its own degradation, suggesting self-regulation. Inoculation with virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 results in a drastic reduction in the levels of ubiquitinated XBAT35.2 and an increase in the abundance of the E3. This implies that pathogen infection prohibits XBAT35.2 self-regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes the E3. In agreement with a role in defending against pathogens, XBAT35.2 interacts with defense-related Accelerated Cell Death11 (ACD11) in planta and promotes the proteasome-dependent turnover of ACD11 in cell-free degradation assays. In accordance with regulation by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized XBAT35.2, the levels of ubiquitinated ACD11 increased considerably, and the abundance of ACD11 was reduced following pathogen infection. In addition, treatment of transgenic seedlings with a proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ACD11, confirming proteasome-dependent degradation. Collectively, these results highlight a novel role for XBAT35.2 in cell death induction and defense against pathogens.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian oscillator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of circadian oscillator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

A SUMO Ligase AtMMS21 Regulates the Stability of the Chromatin Remodeler BRAHMA in Root Development
<p>Chromatin remodeling is essential for gene expression regulation in plant development and response to stresses. Brahma (BRM) is a conserved ATPase in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and is involved in various biological processes in plant cells, but the regulation mechanism on BRM protein remains unclear. Here, we report that BRM interacts with AtMMS21, a SUMO ligase in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The interaction was confirmed in different approaches in vivo and in vitro. The mutants of <i>BRM</i> and <i>AtMMS21</i> displayed a similar defect in root development. In the <i>mms21-1</i> mutant, the protein level of BRM-GFP was significantly lower than that in wild type, but the RNA level of <i>BRM</i> did not change. Biochemical evidence indicated that BRM was modified by SUMO3, and the reaction was enhanced by AtMMS21. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type AtMMS21 but not the mutated AtMMS21 without SUMO ligase activity was able to recover the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of BRM in <i>mms21-1</i>. Overexpression of <i>BRM</i> in <i>mms21-1</i> partially rescued the developmental defect of roots. Taken together, these results supported that AtMMS21 regulates the protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of BRM in root development.</p>

High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

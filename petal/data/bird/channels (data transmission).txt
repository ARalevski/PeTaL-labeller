Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web tool, Transcriptomine, to explore expression profiling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets retrieved from public archives and systematically curated. To make the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points that exist in isolation in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Activation mechanism of a human SK-calmodulin channel complex elucidated by cryo-EM structures
<p>Small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s mediate neuron excitability and are associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity. They also regulate immune responses and the size of blood cells. Activation of SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s requires calmodulin (CaM), but how CaM binds and opens SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s has been unclear. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a human SK4-CaM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> tetramer. Each lobe of CaM serves a distinct function: The C-lobe binds to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> constitutively, whereas the N-lobe interacts with the S4-S5 linker in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The S4-S5 linker, which contains two distinct helices, undergoes conformational changes upon CaM binding to open the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pore. These structures reveal the gating mechanism of SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s and provide a basis for understanding SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pharmacology.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Membrane depolarization activates BK channels through ROCK-mediated β1 subunit surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction
<p>Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to vasoconstriction. Membrane depolarization also activates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–activated potassium (BK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity that promotes vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. Membrane depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2. ROCK1/2-mediated activation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of β1 subunits to the plasma membrane by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional β1 subunits associated with BKα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s already at the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in pressurized arterial myocytes and vasodilation. Thus, membrane depolarization activates BK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s through stimulation of ROCK- and Rab11A-dependent trafficking of β1 subunits to the surface of arterial myocytes.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, current flow through hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Intracellular cavity of sensor domain controls allosteric gating of TRPA1 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a temperature-sensitive ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activated by various pungent and irritant compounds that can produce pain in humans. Its activation involves an allosteric mechanism whereby electrophilic agonists evoke interactions within cytosolic domains and open the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pore through an integrated nexus formed by intracellular membrane proximal regions that are densely packed beneath the lower segment of the S1–S4 sensor domain.

Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal fever–associated birth defects
<p>Birth defects of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these defects. Neural crest cells are precursor populations essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced defects in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced birth defects in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these defects, we engineered iron-binding modifications to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activation of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in specific cellular locations and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.

TALK-1 channels control β cell endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves critical roles in controlling pancreatic β cell function and becomes perturbed during the pathogenesis of diabetes. ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is determined by ion movements across the ER membrane, including K<sup>+</sup> flux through K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. We demonstrated that K<sup>+</sup> flux through ER-localized TALK-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s facilitated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER in mouse and human β cells. We found that β cells from mice lacking TALK-1 exhibited reduced basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, suggesting reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak. These changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis were presumably due to TALK-1–mediated ER K<sup>+</sup> flux, because we recorded K<sup>+</sup> currents mediated by functional TALK-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s on the nuclear membrane, which is continuous with the ER. Moreover, overexpression of K<sup>+</sup>-impermeable TALK-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in HEK293 cells did not reduce ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in β cells is associated with ER stress and islet dysfunction in diabetes, and islets from TALK-1–deficient mice fed a high-fat diet showed reduced signs of ER stress, suggesting that TALK-1 activity exacerbated ER stress. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> establish TALK-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s as key regulators of β cell ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> and suggest that TALK-1 may be a therapeutic target to reduce ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling defects in β cells during the pathogenesis of diabetes.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p>Ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s selective for other monatomic ions, only one type of proton-selective ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. Evolutionary conservation of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribution suggest a broad role for proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN.

Selective inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 channels reverses hyperexcitability of peripheral nociceptors and alleviates postsurgical pain

Adenosine inhibits T cell motility through the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and suppression of KCa3.1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. We conducted three-dimensional chemotaxis experiments to elucidate the effect of adenosine on the migration of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in the presence of adenosine, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than on healthy donor (HD) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This response correlated with the inability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to infiltrate tumors. The effect of adenosine was mimicked by an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist and prevented by an A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist. We found no differences in A<sub>2A</sub>R expression, 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate abundance, or protein kinase A type 1 activity between HNSCC and HD CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We instead detected a decrease in KCa3.1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity, but not expression, in HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Activation of KCa3.1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s by 1-EBIO restored the ability of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to chemotax in the presence of adenosine. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> highlight the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to adenosine and the potential therapeutic benefit of KCa3.1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activators, which could increase infiltration of these T cells into tumors.</p>

Integrated in vivo multiomics analysis identifies p21-activated kinase signaling as a driver of colitis
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from individual samples, we tracked information flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during inflammation. We also ascertained the types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> that best described particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set provided a distinct viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Combining human transcriptomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> with the mouse multiomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.</p>

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. Upon stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent signaling was further required to stimulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for DC maturation. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and Panx1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are crucial players in the regulation of DC migration to endogenous danger signals.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>bases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>base.

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s that regulate the intracellular concentration of ions and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, deletion of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that expression of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proportion of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementation with a high concentration of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity in B cell development.</p>

The channel-kinase TRPM7 regulates antigen gathering and internalization in B cells
<p>Members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are cellular sensors involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. We identified the TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>-kinase as a previously uncharacterized regulator of B cell activation. We showed that TRPM7 played a critical role in the early events of B cell activation through both its ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> and kinase functions. DT40 B cells deficient in TRPM7 or expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of TRPM7 showed defective gathering of antigen and prolonged B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. We showed that lipid metabolism was altered in TRPM7-deficient cells and in cells expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of TRPM7 and suggest that PLC-γ2 may be a target of the kinase activity of TRPM7. Primary B cells that expressed less TRPM7 or were treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of TRPM7 also displayed defective antigen gathering and increased BCR signaling. Finally, we demonstrated that blocking TRPM7 function compromised antigen internalization and presentation to T cells. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggest that TRPM7 controls an essential process required for B cell affinity maturation and the production of high-affinity antibodies.</p>

Transmembrane helix connectivity in Orai1 controls two gates for calcium-dependent transcription
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> Orai1 requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum and an interaction with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1 to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Alterations in Orai1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx have been linked to several pathological conditions including immunodeficiency, tubular myopathy, and cancer. We screened large-scale cancer genomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets for dysfunctional Orai1 mutants. Five of the identified Orai1 mutations resulted in constitutively active gating and transcriptional activation. Our analysis showed that certain Orai1 mutations were clustered in the transmembrane 2 helix surrounding the pore, which is a trigger site for Orai1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating. Analysis of the constitutively open Orai1 mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s revealed two fundamental gates that enabled Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx: Arginine side chains were displaced so they no longer blocked the pore, and a chain of water molecules formed in the hydrophobic pore region. Together, these results enabled us to identify a cluster of Orai1 mutations that trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation associated with gene transcription and provide a gating mechanism for Orai1.</p>

Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons
<p>Neuropeptides released from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are released from intracellular vesicles through two modes: a partial release mode called “kiss-and-run” (KAR) and a full release mode called “full fusion–like” (FFL). Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the release of pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein–tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through either voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s (VGCCs) or ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VGCCs stimulated FFL and a greater single release of neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s stimulated KAR and a pulsed but prolonged release of neuropeptides that was partially mediated by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL. Thus, KAR and FFL release modes are differentially regulated by the two principal types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in DRG neurons.</p>

Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation by PKA stimulates the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia and diabetes
<p>Hypercontractility of arterial myocytes and enhanced vascular tone during diabetes are, in part, attributed to the effects of increased glucose (hyperglycemia) on L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. In murine arterial myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity in response to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pore-forming subunit (α1<sub>C</sub>) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity were associated with PKA activity, leading to α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup>. Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)–fed mice and nondiabetic patients, arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice and from diabetic patients had increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity. Arterial myocytes and arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind PKA did not exhibit increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin mice expressing a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with Ser<sup>1928</sup> mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the HFD-induced increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup> in stimulating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity and vasoconstriction by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to increased glucose and in diabetes.</p>

Membrane protein insertion through a mitochondrial β-barrel gate

Improving election prediction internationally

We also participated in two live forecasting experiments. Our models correctly predicted 80 to 90% of elections in out-of-sample tests. The results suggest that global elections can be successfully modeled and that they are likely to become more predictable as more information becomes available in future elections. The results provide strong evidence for the impact of political institutions and incumbent advantage. They also provide evidence to support contentions about the importance of international linkage and aid. Direct evidence for economic indicators as predictors of election outcomes is relatively weak. The results suggest that, with some adjustments, global polling is a robust predictor of election outcomes, even in developing states. Implications of these findings after the latest U.S. presidential election are discussed.</p>

How boundaries shape chemical delivery in microfluidics
<p>Many microfluidic systems—including chemical reaction, sample analysis, separation, chemotaxis, and drug development and injection—require control and precision of solute transport. Although concentration levels are easily specified at injection, pressure-driven transport through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s is known to spread the initial distribution, resulting in reduced concentrations downstream. Here we document an unexpected phenomenon: The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>’s cross-sectional aspect ratio alone can control the shape of the concentration profile along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> length. Thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s (aspect ratio << 1) deliver solutes arriving with sharp fronts and tapering tails, whereas thick <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s (aspect ratio ~ 1) produce the opposite effect. This occurs for rectangular and elliptical pipes, independent of initial distributions. Thus, it is possible to deliver solute with prescribed distributions, ranging from gradual buildup to sudden delivery, based only on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> dimensions.</p>

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their assembly in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, selectively binds with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its assembly in complex. How SEC11 binding is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are thought to compete for the same SNARE binding site. Here, we identify a second binding motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 binding independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> fragment. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> recorded from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously recorded bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> in a standardised form to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>.</p>

cGMP-Elevating Compounds and Ischemic Conditioning Provide Cardioprotection Against Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury via Cardiomyocyte-Specific BK Channels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I signaling pathway can afford protection against the ischemia/reperfusion injury that occurs during myocardial infarction. Reportedly, voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s of the BK type are stimulated by cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I, and recent ex vivo studies implicated that increased BK activity favors the survival of the myocardium at ischemia/reperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether the molecular events downstream of cGMP involve BK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s present in cardiomyocytes or in other cardiac cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene-targeted mice with a cardiomyocyte- or smooth muscle cell–specific deletion of the BK (CMBK or SMBK knockouts) were subjected to the open-chest model of myocardial infarction. Infarct sizes of the conditional mutants were compared with litter-matched controls, global BK knockout, and wild-type mice. Cardiac damage was assessed after mechanical conditioning or pharmacological stimulation of the cGMP pathway and by using direct modulators of BK. Long-term outcome was studied with respect to heart functions and cardiac fibrosis in a chronic myocardial infarction model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Global BK knockouts and CMBK knockouts, in contrast with SMBK knockouts, exhibited significantly larger infarct sizes compared with their respective controls. Ablation of CMBK resulted in higher serum levels of cardiac troponin I and elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species, lower phosphorylated extracellular receptor kinase and phosphorylated AKT levels and an increase in myocardial apoptosis. Moreover, CMBK was required to allow beneficial effects of both nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase activation and inhibition of the cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-5, ischemic preconditioning, and postconditioning regimens. To this end, after 4 weeks of reperfusion, fibrotic tissue increased and myocardial strain echocardiography was significantly compromised in CMBK-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lack of CMBK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s renders the heart more susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury, whereas the pathological events elicited by ischemia/reperfusion do not involve BK in vascular smooth muscle cells. BK seems to permit the protective effects triggered by cinaciguat, riociguat, and different phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and beneficial actions of ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning by a mechanism stemming primarily from cardiomyocytes. This study establishes mitochondrial CMBK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s as a promising target for limiting acute cardiac damage and adverse long-term events that occur after myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Role of Diastolic Stress Testing in the Evaluation for Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is challenging and relies largely on demonstration of elevated cardiac filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure).

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers <i>en route</i> to the Golgi. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, which cause them to become excited upon illumination (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitation: Light-gated ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulation, focused on small regions, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applications to optically control neuronal dysfunctions, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

A small-molecule inhibitor of TRPC5 ion channels suppresses progressive kidney disease in animal models
<p>Progressive kidney diseases are often associated with scarring of the kidney’s filtration unit, a condition called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This scarring is due to loss of podocytes, cells critical for glomerular filtration, and leads to proteinuria and kidney failure. Inherited forms of FSGS are caused by Rac1-activating mutations, and Rac1 induces TRPC5 ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity and cytoskeletal remodeling in podocytes. Whether TRPC5 activity mediates FSGS onset and progression is unknown. We identified a small molecule, AC1903, that specifically blocks TRPC5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity in glomeruli of proteinuric rats. Chronic administration of AC1903 suppressed severe proteinuria and prevented podocyte loss in a transgenic rat model of FSGS. AC1903 also provided therapeutic benefit in a rat model of hypertensive proteinuric kidney disease. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> indicate that TRPC5 activity drives disease and that TRPC5 inhibitors may be valuable for the treatment of progressive kidney diseases.</p>

Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling of a multicellular organism
<p>To resolve cellular heterogeneity, we developed a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of single cells or nuclei, termed sci-RNA-seq (single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). We applied sci-RNA-seq to profile nearly 50,000 cells from the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> at the L2 larval stage, which provided >50-fold “shotgun” cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> generated by sci-RNA-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.</p>

The voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the four repeats exhibit distinct conformations.

On the cytoplasmic side, a conserved amino-terminal domain is placed below VSD<sub>I</sub>, and a carboxy-terminal domain binds to the III-IV linker.

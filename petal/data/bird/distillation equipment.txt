Social science, today
<p>Generally, social scientists have been poorly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">equip</span></strong>ped to deal with the 21st-cen­tury deluge of large-scale complex data. Computer scientists, well <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">equip</span></strong>ped to handle the data, are often ignorant of social theory and of foundational research methods in the social sciences. What is needed is an articula­tion of core principles of designing research that are accessible to multiple disciplines. Into this breach steps Matthew Salganik with <i>Bit by Bit.</i></p>

<p>Ten years ago, Wikipedia was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> in its infancy (and totally dismissed by the establishment), Facebook was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> restricted to university users, Twitter was in beta testing, and improving search capabilities was the topic that dominated Web conference research agendas.

Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been correlated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> required to confirm the exact role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively correlated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively correlated with photosynthetic performance. Correlations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly correlated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Ethylene-Regulated Glutamate Dehydrogenase Fine-Tunes Metabolism during Anoxia-Reoxygenation
<p>Ethylene is an essential hormone in plants that is involved in low-oxygen and reoxygenation responses. As a key transcription factor in ethylene signaling, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) activates targets that trigger various responses. However, most of these targets are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> poorly characterized. Through analyses of our microarray data and the published Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EIN3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set, we inferred the putative targets of EIN3 during anoxia-reoxygenation. Among them, <i>GDH2</i>, which encodes one subunit of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), was chosen for further studies for its role in tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment. We demonstrated that both <i>GDH1</i> and <i>GDH2</i> are induced during anoxia and reoxygenation and that this induction is mediated via ethylene signaling. In addition, the results of enzymatic assays showed that the level of GDH during anoxia-reoxygenation decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutants <i>ein2-5</i> and <i>ein3eil1</i>. Global metabolite analysis indicated that the deamination activity of GDH might regenerate 2-oxoglutarate, which is a cosubstrate that facilitates the breakdown of alanine by alanine aminotransferase when reoxygenation occurs. Moreover, ineffective tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment, disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, reduced phytosterol biosynthesis, and delayed energy regeneration were found in <i>gdh1gdh2</i> and ethylene mutants during reoxygenation. Taken together, these data illustrate the essential role of EIN3-regulated GDH activity in metabolic adjustment during anoxia-reoxygenation.</p>

Transmission between Archaic and Modern Human Ancestors during the Evolution of the Oncogenic Human Papillomavirus 16
<p>Every human suffers through life a number of papillomaviruses (PVs) infections, most of them asymptomatic. A notable exception are persistent infections by <i>Human papillomavirus 16</i> (HPV16), the most oncogenic infectious agent for humans and responsible for most infection-driven anogenital cancers. Oncogenic potential is not homogeneous among HPV16 lineages, and genetic variation within HPV16 exhibits some geographic structure. However, an in-depth analysis of the HPV16 evolutionary history was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> wanting. We have analyzed extant HPV16 diversity and compared the evolutionary and phylogeographical patterns of humans and of HPV16. We show that codivergence with modern humans explains at most 30% of the present viral geographical distribution. The most explanatory scenario suggests that ancestral HPV16 already infected ancestral human populations and that viral lineages co-diverged with the hosts in parallel with the split between archaic Neanderthal-Denisovans and ancestral modern human populations, generating the ancestral HPV16A and HPV16BCD viral lineages, respectively. We propose that after out-of-Africa migration of modern human ancestors, sexual transmission between human populations introduced HPV16A into modern human ancestor populations. We hypothesize that differential coevolution of HPV16 lineages with different but closely related ancestral human populations and subsequent host-switch events in parallel with introgression of archaic alleles into the genomes of modern human ancestors may be largely responsible for the present-day differential prevalence and association with cancers for HPV16 variants.</p>

Detecting Sequence Homology at the Gene Cluster Level with MultiGeneBlast
<p>The genes encoding many biomolecular systems and pathways are genomically organized in operons or gene clusters. With MultiGeneBlast, we provide a user-friendly and effective tool to perform homology searches with operons or gene clusters as basic units, instead of single genes. The contextualization offered by MultiGeneBlast allows users to get a better understanding of the function, evolutionary history, and practical applications of such genomic regions. The tool is fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">equip</span></strong>ped with applications to generate search databases from GenBank or from the user’s own sequence data. Finally, an architecture search mode allows searching for gene clusters with novel configurations, by detecting genomic regions with any user-specified combination of genes. Sources, precompiled binaries, and a graphical tutorial of MultiGeneBlast are freely available from <ext-link>http://multigeneblast.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">equip</span></strong>ping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">equip</span></strong>ped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments
<p>Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of heat tolerance. Our <bold>G</bold> matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased heat tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened heat tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping heat tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

The aim   of this study was to investigate the results of staged skeletal   reconstruction after a leg lengthening procedure using an external   fixator in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 11 patients who underwent staged reconstruction with   either an arthroplasty (n = 6) or an arthrodesis (n = 5). A control   group of 11 patients who had undergone wide excision and concurrent   reconstruction with an arthroplasty were matched for gender, location,   and size of tumour. We investigated the change in leg-length discrepancy,   function as assessed by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Scale   (MSTS) score and complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A mean 5.2 cm (1.7 to 8.9) of lengthening was achieved. The mean   MSTS scores significantly improved after staged reconstruction (p   = 0.003) but were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> worse than those of the control group (p   = 0.049). However, the MSTS scores of the arthroplasty subgroup   were comparable with those of the controls, although the extensor   lag was greater and the range of movement was less. The patient   group experienced more complications, but all of these resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Approximately 5 cm of lengthening and significant functional   improvement can be achieved by staged reconstruction and lengthening,   without major complications. Although it has limitations, this method   of treatment seems to be a satisfactory surgical option for growing   children with a significant leg-length discrepancy after excision   of an osteosarcoma around the knee.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:401–8.</p></sec>

Clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of extracorporeal irradiation in limb salvage surgery for bone tumours
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a retrospective review of patients treated with extracorporeally   irradiated allografts for primary and secondary bone tumours with   the mid- and long-term survivorship and the functional and radiographic   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 113 of 116 (97.4%) patients who were treated with   extracorporeally irradiated allografts between 1996 and 2014 were   followed up. Forms of treatment included reconstructions, prostheses   and composite reconstructions, both with and without vascularised   grafts. Survivorship was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.   Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a mean age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a mean age of 26 years (3 to 85). There   were 23 deaths. The five-year patient survivorship was 82.3% and   the ten-year patient survivorship was 79.6%. The mean follow-up   of the 90 surviving patients was 80.3 months (2 to 207). At the   last follow-up, 105 allografts (92.9%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> in place or had   been at the time of death; eight (7%) had failed due to infection,   local recurrence or fracture. Outcome scores were comparable with   or superior to those in previous studies. The mean outcome scores   were: MSTS 79% (<sc>sd</sc> 8); TESS 83% (<sc>sd</sc> 19); QLQ 82%   (<sc>sd</sc> 16); ISOLS 80.5% (<sc>sd</sc> 19). </p><p>Pearson correlation analysis showed a strong relationship between   the MSTS and ISOLS scores (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that extracorporeal irradiation is a versatile   reconstructive technique for dealing with large defects after the   resection of bone tumours with good functional and radiographic   outcomes.

What is the morbidity of a non-invasive growing prosthesis?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Extendible endoprostheses have been available for more than 30   years and have become more sophisticated with time. The latest generation   is ‘non-invasive’ and can be lengthened with an external magnetic   force. Early results have shown a worryingly high rate of complications   such as infection. This study investigates the incidence of complications   and the need for further surgery in a cohort of patients with a   non-invasive growing endoprosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2003 and June 2014, 50 children (51 prostheses) had a   non-invasive growing prosthesis implanted for a primary bone sarcoma.   The minimum follow-up was 24 months for those who survived. Their   mean age was 10.4 years (6 to 14). The incidence of complications   and further surgery was documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 64 months (20 to 145). The overall survivorship   of the patients was 84% at three years and 70% at five years. Revision-free   survival was 81.7% at three years and 61.6% at five years with competing   risk analysis. Deep infection occurred in 19.6% of implants at a   mean of 12.5 months (0 to 55). Other complications were a failure   of the lengthening mechanism in five prostheses (9.8%) and breakage   of the implant in two (3.9%). Overall, there were 53 additional   operations (0 to 5 per patient). A total of seven patients (14%)   underwent amputation, three for local recurrence and four for infection.   Their mean limb length discrepancy was 4.3 mm (0 to 25) and mean Musculoskeletal   Tumor Society Score functional score was 26.5 (18 to 30) at the   final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When compared with previously published early results, this mid-term   series has shown continued good functional outcomes and compensation   for leg-length discrepancy.

Is limb salvage surgery safe for bone sarcomas identified after a previous surgical procedure?
<p>Bone sarcomas are rare cancers and orthopaedic   surgeons come across them infrequently, sometimes unexpectedly during   surgical procedures. We investigated the outcomes of patients who   underwent a surgical procedure where sarcomas were found unexpectedly   and were subsequently referred to our unit for treatment. We identified   95 patients (44 intra-lesional excisions, 35 fracture fixations,   16 joint replacements) with mean age of 48 years (11 to 83); 60%   were males (n = 57). Local recurrence arose in 40% who underwent   limb salvage surgery <i>versus</i> 12% who had an amputation.   Despite achieving local control, overall survival was worse for   patients treated with amputation rather than limb salvage (54% <i>vs</i> 75%   five-year survival). Factors that negatively influenced survival   were invasive primary surgery (fracture fixation, joint replacement),   a delay of greater than two months until referral to our oncology   service, and high-grade tumours. Survival in these circumstances   depends mostly on factors that are determined prior to definitive   treatment by a tertiary orthopaedic oncology unit. Limb salvage   in this group of patients is associated with a higher rate of inadequate   marginal surgery and, consequently, higher local recurrence rates   than amputation, but should <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> be attempted whenever possible,   as local control is not the primary determinant of survival. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:665–72.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
From shape to cells: mouse models reveal mechanisms altering palate development in Apert syndrome
<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by severe skull malformations and caused by one of two missense mutations, S252W and P253R, on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The molecular bases underlying differential Apert syndrome phenotypes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> poorly understood and it is unclear why cleft palate is more frequent in patients carrying the S252W mutation. Taking advantage of Apert syndrome mouse models, we performed a novel combination of morphometric, histological and immunohistochemical analyses to precisely quantify distinct palatal phenotypes in <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> and <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></i> mice. We localized regions of differentially altered FGF signaling and assessed local cell patterns to establish a baseline for understanding the differential effects of these two <i>Fgfr2</i> mutations. Palatal suture scoring and comparative 3D shape analysis from high resolution μCT images of 120 newborn mouse skulls showed that <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> mice display relatively more severe palate dysmorphologies, with contracted and more separated palatal shelves, a greater tendency to fuse the maxillary-palatine sutures and aberrant development of the inter-premaxillary suture. These palatal defects are associated with suture-specific patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The posterior region of the developing palate emerges as a potential target for therapeutic strategies in clinical management of cleft palate in Apert syndrome patients.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

An extracellular region of Serrate is essential for ligand-induced cis-inhibition of Notch signaling
<p>Cell-to-cell communication via the Notch pathway is mediated between the membrane-bound Notch receptor and either of its canonical membrane-bound ligands Delta or Serrate. Notch ligands mediate receptor transactivation between cells and also mediate receptor cis-inhibition when Notch and ligand are co-expressed on the same cell. We demonstrate in <i>Drosophila</i> that removal of any of the EGF-like repeats (ELRs) 4, 5 or 6 results in a Serrate molecule capable of transactivating Notch but exhibiting little or no Notch cis-inhibition capacity. These forms of Serrate require Epsin (Liquid facets) to transduce a signal, suggesting that ELR 4-6-deficient ligands <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> require endocytosis for Notch activation. We also demonstrate that ELRs 4-6 are responsible for the dominant-negative effects of Serrate ligand forms that lack the intracellular domain and are therefore incapable of endocytosis in the ligand-expressing cell. We find that ELRs 4-6 of Serrate are conserved across species but do not appear to be conserved in Delta homologs.</p>

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the risks of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased risk of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar risk of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing risk analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke risk (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing risk model), with no difference in ICH risk compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing risk model), with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH. Thus, OACs may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> be considered as thromboprophylaxis for elderly patients, with NOACs being the more favorable choice.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> associated with higher rates of death or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with death or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment. These findings suggest that the SVI could be a more appropriate treatment target than cardiac index in PAH.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

NMDA-Type Glutamate Receptor Activation Promotes Vascular Remodeling and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive proliferation and apoptosis resistance in pulmonary vascular cells underlie vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Specific treatments for PAH exist, mostly targeting endothelial dysfunction, but high pulmonary arterial pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> causes heart failure and death. Pulmonary vascular remodeling may be driven by metabolic reprogramming of vascular cells to increase glutaminolysis and glutamate production. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a major neuronal glutamate receptor, is also expressed on vascular cells, but its role in PAH is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the status of the glutamate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and controls through mass spectrometry imaging, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We measured the glutamate release from cultured pulmonary vascular cells using enzymatic assays and analyzed NMDAR regulation/phosphorylation through Western blot experiments. The effect of NMDAR blockade on human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation was determined using a BrdU incorporation assay. We assessed the role of NMDARs in vascular remodeling associated to pulmonary hypertension, in both smooth muscle-specific NMDAR knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia and the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension using NMDAR blockers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report glutamate accumulation, upregulation of the NMDAR, and NMDAR engagement reflected by increases in GluN1-subunit phosphorylation in the pulmonary arteries of human patients with PAH. K<sub>v</sub> channel inhibition and type A-selective endothelin receptor activation amplified calcium-dependent glutamate release from human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell, and type A-selective endothelin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation led to NMDAR engagement, highlighting crosstalk between the glutamate-NMDAR axis and major PAH-associated pathways. The platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced proliferation of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells involved NMDAR activation and phosphorylated GluN1 subunit localization to cell-cell contacts, consistent with glutamatergic communication between proliferating human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells via NMDARs. Smooth-muscle NMDAR deficiency in mice attenuated the vascular remodeling triggered by chronic hypoxia, highlighting the role of vascular NMDARs in pulmonary hypertension. Pharmacological NMDAR blockade in the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension had beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular remodeling, decreasing endothelial dysfunction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis resistance while disrupting the glutamate-NMDAR pathway in pulmonary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal a dysregulation of the glutamate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and identify vascular NMDARs as targets for antiremodeling treatments in PAH.</p></sec>

Effect of Losartan on Right Ventricular Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers on right ventricular (RV) function is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> unknown. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are beneficial in patients with acquired left ventricular dysfunction, and recent findings have suggested a favorable effect in symptomatic patients with systemic RV dysfunction.

Overall, RV EF did not change in patients allocated to losartan (n=42) (44.4±5.1% to 45.2±5.0%) and placebo (n=46) (43.2±6.3% to 43.6±6.9%). Losartan did not significantly improve RV EF in comparison with placebo (+0.51%; 95% confidence interval, –1.0 to +2.0; <i>P</i>=0.50). No significant treatment effects were found on secondary outcomes: left ventricular EF, peak aerobic exercise capacity, and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (<i>P</i>>0.30 for all). In predefined subgroup analyses, losartan did not have a statistically significant impact on RV EF in subgroups with symptoms, restrictive RV, RV EF<40%, pulmonary valve replacement, or QRS fragmentation. However, in a post hoc analysis, losartan was associated with improved RV EF in a subgroup (n=30) with nonrestrictive RV and incomplete remodeling (QRS fragmentation and previous pulmonary valve replacement) (+2.7%; 95% confidence interval, +0.1 to +5.4; <i>P</i>=0.045).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Losartan had no significant effect on RV dysfunction or secondary outcome parameters in repaired tetralogy of Fallot.

Inhibition of MicroRNA-146a and Overexpression of Its Target Dihydrolipoyl Succinyltransferase Protect Against Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy and Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases remain the predominant cause of death worldwide, with the prevalence of heart failure continuing to increase. Despite increased knowledge of the metabolic alterations that occur in heart failure, novel therapies to treat the observed metabolic disturbances are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mice were subjected to pressure overload by means of angiotensin-II infusion or transversal aortic constriction. MicroRNA-146a was either genetically or pharmacologically knocked out or genetically overexpressed in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) in the murine heart was performed by means of an adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MicroRNA-146a was upregulated in whole heart tissue in multiple murine pressure overload models. Also, microRNA-146a levels were moderately increased in left ventricular biopsies of patients with aortic stenosis. Overexpression of microRNA-146a in cardiomyocytes provoked cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in vivo, whereas genetic knockdown or pharmacological blockade of microRNA-146a blunted the hypertrophic response and attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-146a reduced its target DLST—the E2 subcomponent of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, a rate-controlling tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. DLST protein levels significantly decreased on pressure overload in wild-type mice, paralleling a decreased oxidative metabolism, whereas DLST protein levels and hence oxidative metabolism were partially maintained in microRNA-146a knockout mice.

Pathologic Stimulus Determines Lineage Commitment of Cardiac C-kit<sup>+</sup> Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although cardiac c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells are being tested in clinical trials, the circumstances that determine lineage differentiation of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo are unknown. Recent findings suggest that endogenous cardiac c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells rarely contribute cardiomyocytes to the adult heart. We assessed whether various pathological stimuli differentially affect the eventual cell fates of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used single-cell sequencing and genetic lineage tracing of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells to determine whether various pathological stimuli would result in different fates of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Single-cell sequencing of cardiac CD45<sup>-</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells showed innate heterogeneity, indicative of the existence of vascular and mesenchymal c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells in normal hearts. Cardiac pressure overload resulted in a modest increase in c-kit-derived cardiomyocytes, with significant increases in the numbers of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity did not increase c-kit-derived endothelial cell fates but instead induced cardiomyocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in expression of p53. Inhibition of p53 blocked cardiomyocyte differentiation in response to doxorubicin, whereas stabilization of p53 was sufficient to increase c-kit-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results demonstrate that different pathological stimuli induce different cell fates of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo. Although the overall rate of cardiomyocyte formation from c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> below clinically relevant levels, we show that p53 is central to the ability of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells to adopt cardiomyocyte fates, which could lead to the development of strategies to preferentially generate cardiomyocytes from c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of pivotal trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care. However, there are few data on how these trials influenced the frequency of EVT in clinical practice. We used data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program to determine how the frequency of EVT changed in US practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of 2 437 975 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2222 participating hospitals between April 2003 and the third quarter of 2016. Weighted linear regression with 2 linear splines and a knot at January 2015 was used to compare the slope of the change in EVT use before and after the pivotal trials were published. Potentially eligible patients were defined as last known well to arrival time ≤4.5 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of EVT use was slowly increasing before January 2015 but then sharply accelerated thereafter. In the third quarter 2016, EVT was provided to 3.3% of all patients with ischemic stroke at all hospitals, representing 15.1% of all patients who were potentially eligible for EVT based on stroke duration and severity. At EVT-capable hospitals, 7.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible patients. From 2013 to 2016, case volumes nearly doubled at EVT-capable hospitals. Mean case volume per EVT-capable hospital was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters. EVT case volumes increased in nearly all US states from 2014 to the last 4 quarters, but with persistent geographic variation unexplained by differences in potential patient eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>EVT use is increasing rapidly; however, there are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> opportunities to treat more patients. Reorganizing stroke systems to route patients to adequately resourced EVT-capable hospitals might increase treatment of eligible patients, improve outcomes, and reduce disparities.</p></sec>

Little information on mortality trends in the most recent years is available. We assessed trends in characteristics, treatments, and outcomes for acute myocardial infarction in France between 1995 and 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from 5 one-month registries, conducted 5 years apart, from 1995 to 2015, including 14 423 patients with acute myocardial infarction (59% STEMI) admitted to cardiac intensive care units in metropolitan France.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 1995 to 2015, mean age decreased from 66±14 to 63±14 years in patients with STEMI; it remained stable (68±14 years) in patients with NSTEMI, whereas diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension increased. At the acute stage, intended primary percutaneous coronary intervention increased from 12% (1995) to 76% (2015) in patients with STEMI. In patients with NSTEMI, percutaneous coronary intervention ≤72 hours from admission increased from 9% (1995) to 60% (2015). Six-month mortality consistently decreased in patients with STEMI from 17.2% in 1995 to 6.9% in 2010 and 5.3% in 2015; it decreased from 17.2% to 6.9% in 2010 and 6.3% in 2015 in patients with NSTEMI. Mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> decreased after 2010 in patients with STEMI without reperfusion therapy, whereas no further mortality gain was found in patients with STEMI with reperfusion therapy or in patients with NSTEMI, whether or not they were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Over the past 20 years, 6-month mortality after acute myocardial infarction has decreased considerably for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI. Mortality figures continued to decline in patients with STEMI until 2015, whereas mortality in patients with NSTEMI appears stable since 2010.</p></sec>

In Vivo Functional Selection Identifies Cardiotrophin-1 as a Cardiac Engraftment Factor for Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transplantation of cells into the infarcted heart has significant potential to improve myocardial recovery; however, low efficacy of cell engraftment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> limits therapeutic benefit. Here, we describe a method for the unbiased, in vivo selection of cytokines that improve mesenchymal stromal cell engraftment into the heart both in normal conditions and after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An arrayed library of 80 secreted factors, including most of the currently known interleukins and chemokines, were individually cloned into adeno-associated viral vectors. Pools from this library were then used for the batch transduction of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo, followed by intramyocardial cell administration in normal and infarcted mice. Three weeks after injection, vector genomes were recovered from the few persisting cells and identified by sequencing DNA barcodes uniquely labeling each of the tested cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The most effective molecule identified by this competitive engraftment screening was cardiotrophin-1, a member of the interleukin-6 family. Intracardiac injection of mesenchymal stromal cells transiently preconditioned with cardiotrophin-1 preserved cardiac function and reduced infarct size, parallel to the persistence of the transplanted cells in the healing hearts for at least 2 months after injection. Engraftment of cardiotrophin-1–treated mesenchymal stromal cells was consequent to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3–mediated activation of the focal adhesion kinase and its associated focal adhesion complex and the consequent acquisition of adhesive properties by the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results support the feasibility of selecting molecules in vivo for their functional properties with adeno-associated viral vector libraries and identify cardiotrophin-1 as a powerful cytokine promoting cell engraftment and thus improving cell therapy of the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec>

Functional Definition of Progenitors Versus Mature Endothelial Cells Reveals Key SoxF-Dependent Differentiation Process
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>During adult life, blood vessel formation is thought to occur via angiogenic processes involving branching from existing vessels. An alternate proposal suggests that neovessels form from endothelial progenitors able to assemble the intimal layers. We here aimed to define vessel-resident endothelial progenitors in vivo in a variety of tissues in physiological and pathological situations such as normal aorta, lungs, and wound healing, tumors, and placenta, as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Based on protein expression levels of common endothelial markers using flow cytometry, 3 subpopulations of endothelial cells could be identified among VE-Cadherin+ and CD45– cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Lineage tracing by using <i>Cdh5cre</i> <sup><i>ERt2</i></sup><i>/Rosa-YFP</i> reporter strategy demonstrated that the CD31–/loVEGFR2lo/intracellular endothelial population was indeed an endovascular progenitor (EVP) of an intermediate CD31intVEGFR2lo/intracellular transit amplifying (TA) and a definitive differentiated (D) CD31hiVEGFR2hi/extracellular population. EVP cells arose from vascular-resident beds that could not be transferred by bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, EVP displayed progenitor-like status with a high proportion of cells in a quiescent cell cycle phase as assessed in wounds, tumors, and aorta. Only EVP cells and not TA and D cells had self-renewal capacity as demonstrated by colony-forming capacity in limiting dilution and by transplantation in Matrigel plugs in recipient mice. RNA sequencing revealed prominent gene expression differences between EVP and D cells. In particular, EVP cells highly expressed genes related to progenitor function including <i>Sox9</i>, <i>Il33</i>, <i>Egfr</i>, and <i>Pdfgrα.</i> Conversely, D cells highly expressed genes related to differentiated endothelium including <i>Ets1&2</i>, <i>Gata2</i>, <i>Cd31</i>, <i>Vwf</i>, and <i>Notch</i>. The RNA sequencing also pointed to an essential role of the <i>Sox18</i> transcription factor. The role of SOX18 in the differentiation process was validated by using lineage-tracing experiments based on S<i>ox18Cre</i><sup><i>ERt2</i></sup><i>/Rosa-YFP</i> mice. Besides, in the absence of functional SOX18/SOXF, EVP progenitors were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> present, but TA and D populations were significantly reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings support an entirely novel endothelial hierarchy, from EVP to TA to D, as defined by self-renewal, differentiation, and molecular profiling of an endothelial progenitor. This paradigm shift in our understanding of vascular-resident endothelial progenitors in tissue regeneration opens new avenues for better understanding of cardiovascular biology.</p></sec>

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> score or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> scores measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort). Analyses on an intention-to-treat cohort were conducted for hemorrhagic events and statistical sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median follow-up period was 10.3 years; 1621 patients (64%) were followed up throughout the study; and 2160 patients (85%) retained their original allocation. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events in the per-protocol cohort (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.42). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, glycemic control, kidney function, smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed similar results (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.30), with no heterogeneity of efficacy in subgroup analyses stratified by each of these factors (all interaction <i>P</i>>0.05). Sensitivity analyses on the intention-to-treat cohort yielded consistent results (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.25). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 25 patients (2%) in the aspirin group and 12 (0.9%) in the no-aspirin group (<i>P</i>=0.03), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was not different between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low-dose aspirin did not affect the risk for cardiovascular events but increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary prevention setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize patient management, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk patients. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart failure, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart failure (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was analyzed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart failure was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) identified those patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional risk marker model in patients with ACHD and can reliably exclude the risk of death and heart failure. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events. These biomarkers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and management of patients with ACHD.</p></sec>

Onset-to-treatment time was analyzed as a continuous, potentially nonlinear variable and as a categorical variable comparing patients treated within 60 minutes of onset with later epochs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 65 384 tissue plasminogen activator–treated patients, the median onset-to-treatment time was 141 minutes (interquartile range, 110–173) and 878 patients (1.3%) were treated within the first 60 minutes. Treatment within 60 minutes, compared with treatment within 61 to 270 minutes, was associated with increased odds of discharge to home (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.45), independent ambulation at discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.45), and freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale 0–1) at discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.46), without increased hemorrhagic complications or in-hospital mortality. The pace of decline in benefit of tissue plasminogen activator from onset-to-treatment times of 20 through 270 minutes was mildly nonlinear for discharge to home, with more rapid benefit loss in the first 170 minutes than later, and linear for independent ambulation and in-hospital mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Thrombolysis started within the first 60 minutes after onset is associated with best outcomes for patients with acute ischemic stroke, and benefit declined more rapidly early after onset for the ability to be discharged home.

P2X<sub>7</sub> Deficiency Blocks Lesional Inflammasome Activity and Ameliorates Atherosclerosis in Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds as a danger signal to purinergic receptor P2X<sub>7</sub> and promotes inflammasome assembly and interleukin-1β expression. We hypothesized a functional role of the signal axis ATP–P2X<sub>7</sub> in inflammasome activation and the chronic inflammation driving atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent and P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient macrophages were isolated and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, ATP, or both. To assess whether P2X<sub>7</sub> may have a role in atherosclerosis, P2X<sub>7</sub> expression was analyzed in aortic arches from low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>-/-</sup> mice consuming a high-cholesterol or chow diet. P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>+/+</sup> and P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>−/−</sup> mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet to investigate the functional role of P2X<sub>7</sub> knockout in atherosclerosis. Human plaques were derived from carotid endarterectomy and stained against P2X<sub>7</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide or ATP stimulation alone did not activate caspase 1 in isolated macrophages. However, priming with lipopolysaccharide, followed by stimulation with ATP, led to an activation of caspase 1 and interleukin-1β in P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent macrophages. In contrast, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient macrophages showed no activation of caspase 1 after sequential stimulation while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> expressing a basal amount of interleukin-1β. P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor was higher expressed in murine atherosclerotic lesions, particularly by lesional macrophages. After 16 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice showed smaller atherosclerotic lesions than P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent mice (0.162 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.023 [n=9], P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>−/−</sup> : 0.084 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.01 [n=11], <i>P</i>=0.004) with a reduced amount of lesional macrophages. In accord with our in vitro findings, lesional caspase 1 activity was abolished in P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> mice. In addition, intravital microscopy revealed reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion in P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice.

Safety and Efficacy of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in Patients With Severe Carotid Artery Stenosis Before Carotid Artery Stenting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) can inhibit recurrent ischemic events effectively in patients with acute or chronic cerebral ischemia. However, it is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> unclear whether RIPC can impede ischemic injury after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Subjects with severe carotid artery stenosis were recruited in this randomized controlled study, and assigned to RIPC, sham, and no intervention (control) groups. All subjects received standard medical therapy. Subjects in the RIPC and sham groups underwent RIPC and sham RIPC twice daily, respectively, for 2 weeks before CAS. Plasma neuron-specific enolase and S-100B were used to evaluate safety, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, and new ischemic diffusion-weighted imaging lesions were used to determine treatment efficacy. The primary outcomes were the presence of ≥1 newly ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging within 48 hours after stenting and clinical events within 6 months after stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We randomly assigned 189 subjects in this study (63 subjects in each group). Both RIPC and sham RIPC procedures were well tolerated and completed with high compliance (98.41% and 95.24%, respectively). Neither plasma neuron-specific enolase levels nor S-100B levels changed significantly before and after treatment. No severe adverse event was attributed to RIPC and sham RIPC procedures. The incidence of new diffusion-weighted imaging lesions in the RIPC group (15.87%) was significantly lower than in the sham group (36.51%; relative risk, 0.44; 96% confidence interval, 0.20–0.91; <i>P</i><0.01) and the control group (41.27%; relative risk, 0.39; 96% confidence interval, 0.21–0.82; <i>P</i><0.01).

However, the contrast between the survival chances of patients with versus without bystander CPR increased over time: within 5 minutes, 30-day survival was 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8–16.4) versus 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6), corresponding to 2.3 times higher chances of survival associated with bystander CPR; within 10 minutes, 30-day survival chances were 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), corresponding to 3.0 times higher chances of 30-day survival associated with bystander CPR. The contrast in 30-day survival became statistically insignificant when response time was >13 minutes (bystander CPR vs no bystander CPR: 3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]), but 30-day survival was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> 2.5 times higher associated with bystander CPR. Based on the model and Danish out-of-hospital cardiac arrest statistics, an additional 233 patients could potentially be saved annually if response time was reduced from 10 to 5 minutes and 119 patients if response time was reduced from 7 (the median response time in this study) to 5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The absolute survival associated with bystander CPR declined rapidly with time. Yet bystander CPR while waiting for an ambulance was associated with a more than doubling of 30-day survival even in case of long ambulance response time. Decreasing ambulance response time by even a few minutes could potentially lead to many additional lives saved every year.</p></sec>

CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells Promote the Transition From Hypertrophy to Heart Failure During Chronic Pressure Overload
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The mechanisms by which the heart adapts to chronic pressure overload, producing compensated hypertrophy and eventually heart failure (HF), are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> not well defined. We aimed to investigate the involvement of T cells in the progression to HF using a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Chronic HF was associated with accumulation of T lymphocytes and activated/effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within cardiac tissue. After TAC, enlarged heart mediastinal draining lymph nodes showed a high density of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets. To investigate the role of T cells in HF, TAC was performed on mice deficient for recombination activating gene 2 expression (RAG2KO) lacking B and T lymphocytes. Compared with wild-type TAC mice, RAG2KO mice did not develop cardiac dilation and showed improved contractile function and blunted adverse remodeling. Reconstitution of the T-cell compartment into RAG2KO mice before TAC enhanced contractile dysfunction, fibrosis, collagen accumulation, and cross-linking. To determine the involvement of a specific T-cell subset, we performed TAC on mice lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> (MHCIIKO) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets (CD8KO). In contrast to CD8KO mice, MHCIIKO mice did not develop ventricular dilation and dysfunction. MHCIIKO mice also displayed very low fibrosis, collagen accumulation, and cross-linking within cardiac tissue. Interestingly, mice with transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell receptor specific for ovalbumin failed to develop HF and adverse remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>These results demonstrate for the first time a crucial role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and specific antigen recognition in the progression from compensated cardiac hypertrophy to HF.</p></sec>

<i>Tbx6</i> controls left-right asymmetry through regulation of <i>Gdf1</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Tbx6 affects morphology of the cilia of the node, but a leftward nodal flow is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> generated. Downstream of nodal flow, Tbx6 regulates the Nodal coligand Gdf1 leading to disruption of left/right axis determination.</p>

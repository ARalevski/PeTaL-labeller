Flavan-3-ols Are an Effective Chemical Defense against Rust Infection
<p>Phenolic secondary metabolites are often thought to protect plants against attack by microbes, but their role in defense against pathogen infection in woody plants has not been investigated comprehensively. We studied the biosynthesis, occurrence, and antifungal activity of flavan-3-ols in black poplar (<i>Populus nigra</i>), which include both monomers, such as catechin, and oligomers, known as proanthocyanidins (PAs). We identified and biochemically characterized three leucoanthocyanidin reductases and two anthocyanidin reductases from <i>P. nigra</i> involved in catalyzing the last steps of flavan-3-ol biosynthesis, leading to the formation of catechin [2,3-trans-(+)-flavan-3-ol] and epicatechin [2,3-cis-(−)-flavan-3-ol], respectively. Poplar trees that were inoculated with the biotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> fungus (<i>Melampsora larici-populina</i>) accumulated higher amounts of catechin and PAs than uninfected trees. The de novo-synthesized catechin and PAs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong>-infected poplar leaves accumulated significantly at the site of fungal infection in the lower epidermis. In planta concentrations of these compounds strongly inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> spore germination and reduced hyphal growth. Poplar genotypes with constitutively higher levels of catechin and PAs as well as hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) overexpressing the <i>MYB134</i> transcription factor were more resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> infection. Silencing <i>PnMYB134</i>, on the other hand, decreased flavan-3-ol biosynthesis and increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> infection. Taken together, our data indicate that catechin and PAs are effective antifungal defenses in poplar against foliar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> infection.</p>

Host-Induced Gene Silencing of the MAPKK Gene <i>PsFUZ7</i> Confers Stable Resistance to Wheat Stripe Rust<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful genetic tool to accelerate research in plant biotechnology and control biotic stresses by manipulating target gene expression. However, the potential of RNAi in wheat to efficiently and durably control the devastating stripe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> fungus <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) remained largely under explored so far. To address this issue, we generated transgenic wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) lines expressing dsRNA targeting <i>PsFUZ7</i> transcripts of <i>Pst</i>. We analyzed expression of <i>PsFUZ7</i> and related genes, and resistance traits of the transgenic wheat lines. We show that <i>PsFUZ7</i> is an important pathogenicity factor that regulates infection and development of <i>Pst</i>. A <i>PsFUZ7</i> RNAi construct stably expressed in two independent transgenic wheat lines confers strong resistance to <i>Pst</i>. <i>Pst</i> hyphal development is strongly restricted, and necrosis of plant cells in resistance responses was significantly induced. We conclude that trafficking of RNA molecules from wheat plants to <i>Pst</i> may lead to a complex molecular dialogue between wheat and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> pathogen. Moreover, we confirm the RNAi-based crop protection approaches can be used, to our knowledge, as a novel control strategy against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> pathogens in wheat.</p>

Wheat—the cereal abandoned by GM
<p>The sudden appearance of crop diseases can cause an irreparable economic shock, particularly to smallholder farmers in developing countries. Wheat blast, for example, is a devastating fungal disease from South America, which emerged in Bangladesh in 2016 (<i>1</i>). It is currently controlled by quarantine but could easily spread to other wheat-growing areas, which could threaten food security. Furthermore, widespread crop failure from stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> has occurred in Kenya and Ethiopia. Recent advances could provide a solution to this problem through the rapid discovery and isolation of disease-resistance genes from wild relatives of wheat, followed by their introduction by transformation into the elite crop varieties. There is, however, a barrier to such progress: Wheat, a worldwide staple food, has become an orphan among genetically modified (GM) crops.</p>

Loss of <i>AvrSr50</i> by somatic exchange in stem rust leads to virulence for <i>Sr50</i> resistance in wheat
<p>Race-specific resistance genes protect the global wheat crop from stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> disease caused by <i>Puccinia graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pgt</i>) but are often overcome owing to evolution of new virulent races of the pathogen. To understand virulence evolution in <i>Pgt</i>, we identified the protein ligand (AvrSr50) recognized by the Sr50 resistance protein. A spontaneous mutant of <i>Pgt</i> virulent to <i>Sr50</i> contained a 2.5 mega–base pair loss-of-heterozygosity event. A haustorial secreted protein from this region triggers <i>Sr50</i>-dependent defense responses in planta and interacts directly with the Sr50 protein. Virulence alleles of <i>AvrSr50</i> have arisen through DNA insertion and sequence divergence, and our data provide molecular evidence that in addition to sexual recombination, somatic exchange can play a role in the emergence of new virulence traits in <i>Pgt</i>.</p>

Variation in the <i>AvrSr35</i> gene determines <i>Sr35</i> resistance against wheat stem rust race Ug99
<p><i>Puccinia graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pgt</i>) causes wheat stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong>, a devastating fungal disease. The <i>Sr35</i> resistance gene confers immunity against this pathogen’s most virulent races, including Ug99. We used comparative whole-genome sequencing of chemically mutagenized and natural <i>Pgt</i> isolates to identify a fungal gene named <i>AvrSr35</i> that is required for <i>Sr35</i> avirulence. The <i>AvrSr35</i> gene encodes a secreted protein capable of interacting with Sr35 and triggering the immune response. We show that the origin of <i>Pgt</i> isolates virulent on <i>Sr35</i> is associated with the nonfunctionalization of the <i>AvrSr35</i> gene by the insertion of a mobile element. The discovery of <i>AvrSr35</i> provides a new tool for <i>Pgt</i> surveillance, identification of host susceptibility targets, and characterization of the molecular determinants of immunity in wheat.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated resistance in cultivated barley enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling resistance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen resistance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

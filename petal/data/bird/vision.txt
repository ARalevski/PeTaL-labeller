Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es that combined the facial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology of one sex or species with the leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ed to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger positive selection. On the contrary, passage <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with positively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation.</p>

Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy of electron beam–sensitive crystalline materials
<p>High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing of electron beam–sensitive materials is one of the most difficult applications of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The challenges are manifold, including the acquisition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es with extremely low beam doses, the time-constrained search for crystal zone axes, the precise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e alignment, and the accurate determination of the defocus value. We develop a suite of methods to fulfill these requirements and acquire atomic-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion TEM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es of several metal organic frameworks that are generally recognized as highly sensitive to electron beams. The high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion allows us to identify individual metal atomic columns, various types of surface termination, and benzene rings in the organic linkers. We also apply our methods to other electron beam–sensitive materials, including the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>.</p>

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, inhibition of ERK activation delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM biosynthesis and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion in settings where defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion promotes disease progression.</p>

Ghost cytometry
<p>Ghost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing is a technique used to produce an object’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e without using a spatially resolving detector. Here we develop a technique we term “ghost cytometry,” an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e-free ultrafast fluorescence “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing” cytometry based on a single-pixel detector. Spatial information obtained from the motion of cells relative to a static randomly patterned optical structure is compressively converted into signals that arrive sequentially at a single-pixel detector. Combinatorial use of the temporal waveform with the intensity distribution of the random pattern allows us to computationally reconstruct cell morphology. More importantly, we show that applying machine-learning methods directly on the compressed waveforms without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e reconstruction enables efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e-free morphology-based cytometry. Despite a compact and inexpensive instrumentation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e-free ghost cytometry achieves accurate and high-throughput cell classification and selective sorting on the basis of cell morphology without a specific biomarker, both of which have been challenging to accomplish using conventional flow cytometers.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing has been achieved.</p>

Observing the cell in its native state: Imaging subcellular dynamics in multicellular organisms
<p>True physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing of subcellular dynamics requires studying cells within their parent organisms, where all the environmental cues that drive gene expression, and hence the phenotypes that we actually observe, are present. A complete understanding also requires volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing of the cell and its surroundings at high spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, without inducing undue stress on either. We combined lattice light-sheet microscopy with <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive optics to achieve, across large multicellular volumes, noninvasive aberration-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing of subcellular processes, including endocytosis, organelle remodeling during mitosis, and the migration of axons, immune cells, and metastatic cancer cells in vivo.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

Quantum reference beacon–guided superresolution optical focusing in complex media
<p>Optical scattering is generally considered to be a nuisance of microscopy that limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing depth and spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion.

Rapid Pliocene adaptive radiation of modern kangaroos
<p>Differentiating between ancient and younger, more rapidly evolved clades is important for determining paleoenvironmental drivers of diversification. Australia possesses many aridity-<strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ed lineages, the origins of which have been closely linked to late Miocene continental aridification. Using dental macrowear and molar crown height measurements, spanning the past 25 million years, we show that the most iconic Australian terrestrial mammals, “true” kangaroos (Macropodini), <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ively radiated in response to mid-Pliocene grassland expansion rather than Miocene aridity.

Our results implicate warm-to-cool climatic oscillations as a trigger for <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive radiation and refute arguments attributing Pleistocene megafaunal extinction to aridity-forced dietary change.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ed, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion observations to resolve four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>es provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.</p>

The genomic landscape of rapid repeated evolutionary adaptation to toxic pollution in wild fish
<p>Atlantic killifish populations have rapidly <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ed to normally lethal levels of pollution in four urban estuaries. Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–based signaling pathway as a shared target of selection. This suggests evolutionary constraint on <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive solutions to complex toxicant mixtures at each site. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive pathway modification among tolerant populations. Selection also targets other toxicity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance phenotypes and potentially compensatory <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ations. Molecular changes are consistent with selection on standing genetic variation.

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation in apple.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Differential Codon Adaptation between dsDNA and ssDNA Phages in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>Because phages use their host translation machinery, their codon usage should evolve toward that of highly expressed host genes. We used two indices to measure codon <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation of phages to their host, <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> (the correlation in relative synonymous codon usage [RSCU] between phages and their host) and Codon <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation Index (CAI) computed with highly expressed host genes as the reference set (because phage translation depends on host translation machinery). These indices used for this purpose are appropriate only when hosts exhibit little mutation bias, so only phages parasitizing <i>Escherichia coli</i> were included in the analysis. For double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages, both <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> and CAI decrease with increasing number of transfer RNA genes encoded by the phage genome. <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> is greater for dsDNA phages than for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages, and the low <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> values are mainly due to poor concordance in RSCU values for Y-ending codons between ssDNA phages and the <i>E. coli</i> host, consistent with the predicted effect of C→T mutation bias in the ssDNA phages. Strong C→T mutation bias would improve codon <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation in codon families (e.g., Gly) where U-ending codons are favored over C-ending codons (“U-friendly” codon families) by highly expressed host genes but decrease codon <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation in other codon families where highly expressed host genes favor C-ending codons against U-ending codons (“U-hostile” codon families). It is remarkable that ssDNA phages with increasing C→T mutation bias also increased the usage of codons in the “U-friendly” codon families, thereby achieving CAI values almost as large as those of dsDNA phages. This represents a new type of codon <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation.</p>

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p>Mechanically activated, slowly <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ing currents in sensory neurons have been linked to noxious mechanosensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such currents and inhibits mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory neurons and a sensory neuron–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. Sensory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ing mechano-gated current linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ing currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons inhibited rapidly <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ing currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic. These data suggest that annexin A6 can be exploited to inhibit chronic mechanical pain.</p>

Neural population control via deep image synthesis
<p>Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today’s most accurate models of the primate brain’s ventral visual stream.

Adaptive introgression enables evolutionary rescue from extreme environmental pollution
<p>Radical environmental change that provokes population decline can impose constraints on the sources of genetic variation that may enable evolutionary rescue. <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive toxicant resistance has rapidly evolved in Gulf killifish (<i>Fundulus grandis</i>) that occupy polluted habitats. We show that resistance scales with pollution level and negatively correlates with inducibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Loci with the strongest signatures of recent selection harbor genes regulating AHR signaling. Two of these loci introgressed recently (18 to 34 generations ago) from Atlantic killifish (<i>F. heteroclitus</i>). One introgressed locus contains a deletion in <i>AHR</i> that confers a large <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive advantage [selection coefficient (<i>s</i>) = 0.8]. Given the limited migration of killifish, recent <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive introgression was likely mediated by human-assisted transport.

Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones.

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds.

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease resistance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.</p>

The development of the Earth’s aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus <i>Malus</i> <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong> to Fe deficiency through modification of the <i>Iron-Regulated Transporter1</i> (<i>IRT1</i>) promoter. Specifically, an <i>IRT1</i> mutant allele with a TATA-box insertion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased <i>IRT1</i> expression. The altered <i>IRT1</i> promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes correlates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-box correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong> to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency.

The single transfer DNA insertion lines <i>CRK28</i> and <i>CRK29</i>, two CRKs induced in response to flagellin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, did not exhibit robust alterations in immune responses. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contrast</span></strong>, silencing of multiple bacterial flagellin-induced CRKs resulted in enhanced susceptibility to pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, indicating functional redundancy in this large gene family. Enhanced expression of <i>CRK28</i> in Arabidopsis increased disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i>. Expression of <i>CRK28</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced cell death, which required intact extracellular Cys residues and a conserved kinase active site. CRK28-mediated cell death required the common receptor-like protein kinase coreceptor BAK1. CRK28 associated with BAK1 as well as the activated FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) immune receptor complex. CRK28 self-associated as well as associated with the closely related CRK29. These data support a model where Arabidopsis CRKs are synthesized upon pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, associate with the FLS2 complex, and coordinately act to enhance plant immune responses.</p>

The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation of auditory sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation within protein-coding genes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contrast</span></strong>ing the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

A Photoreceptor Contributes to the Natural Variation of Diapause Induction in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
<p>Diapause is an <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation that allows organisms to survive harsh environmental conditions. In species occurring over broad habitat ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause induction can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong> to their local environments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, diapause induction is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual reproduction, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual reproduction and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving habitat deterioration. We have previously shown that the induction of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of habitat deterioration and have identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the variation in the induction of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that variation in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the variation observed in resting stage induction. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contrast</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contrast</span></strong> to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ed <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contrast</span></strong>, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Laminins containing the β2 and γ3 chains regulate astrocyte migration and angiogenesis in the retina
<p>Pathologies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l blood vessels are among the major causes of <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">blind</span></strong>ness worldwide. A key cell type that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l vascular development is the astrocyte. Generated extrinsically to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>, astrocytes migrate into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> through the optic nerve head. Even though there is a strong correlation between astrocyte distribution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l vascular development, the factors that guide astrocytes into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> remain unclear. In this study, we show that astrocytes migrate within a laminin-containing basement membrane - the inner limiting membrane. Genetic deletion of the laminin β2 and γ3 chains affects astrocyte migration and spatial distribution. We show that laminins act as haptotactic factors <i>in vitro</i> in an isoform-specific manner, inducing astrocyte migration and promoting astrocyte differentiation. The addition of exogenous laminins to laminin-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l explants rescues astrocyte migration and spatial patterning. Furthermore, we show that the loss of laminins reduces β1 integrin expression in astrocytes. Culturing laminin-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l astrocytes on laminin substrates restores focal localization of β1 integrin. Finally, we show that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains regulate subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l blood vessel growth and maintain vascular integrity. These <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate clearly that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains are indispensable for migration and spatial organization of astrocytes and that they play a crucial role during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l angiogenesis <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and immobile regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise distribution of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing using super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion confocal live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing revealed that SYT1 was distributed to immobile ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into immobile ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the immobile tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are distributed to immobile tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Beyond Porosity: 3D Leaf Intercellular Airspace Traits That Impact Mesophyll Conductance
<p>The leaf intercellular airspace (IAS) is generally considered to have high conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion relative to the liquid phase. While previous studies accounted for leaf-level variation in porosity and mesophyll thickness, they omitted 3D IAS traits that potentially influence IAS conductance (g<sub>IAS</sub>). Here, we reevaluated the standard equation for g<sub>IAS</sub> by incorporating tortuosity, lateral path lengthening, and IAS connectivity. We measured and spatially mapped these geometric IAS traits for 19 Bromeliaceae species with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or C3 photosynthetic pathways using x-ray microcomputed tomography <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing and a novel computational approach. We found substantial variation in porosity (0.04–0.73 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>), tortuosity (1.09–3.33 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>), lateral path lengthening (1.12–3.19 m m<sup>−1</sup>), and IAS connectivity (0.81–0.97 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) across all bromeliad leaves. The revised g<sub>IAS</sub> model predicted significantly lower g<sub>IAS</sub> in CAM (0.01–0.19 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) than in C3 (0.41–2.38 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) plants due to a coordinated decline in these IAS traits. Our reevaluated equation also generally predicted lower g<sub>IAS</sub> values than the former one. Moreover, we observed high spatial heterogeneity in these IAS geometric traits throughout the mesophyll, especially within CAM leaves. Our data show that IAS traits that better capture the 3D complexity of leaves strongly influence g<sub>IAS</sub> and that the impact of the IAS on mesophyll conductance should be carefully considered with respect to leaf anatomy. We provide a simple function to estimate tortuosity and lateral path lengthening in the absence of access to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>ing tools such as x-ray microcomputed tomography or other novel 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imag</span></strong>e-processing techniques.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant chloroplasts constantly accumulate damage caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photodamaged chloroplasts are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells damaged by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light displayed abnormal chloroplasts with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal chloroplasts. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen chloroplasts. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen chloroplasts persisted, and dysfunctional chloroplasts that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Chloroplast swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside chloroplasts or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains chloroplast envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen chloroplasts were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the chloroplast due to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light-derived envelope damage results in chloroplast swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire chloroplasts via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional chloroplasts.</p>

Polyamines Regulate Strawberry Fruit Ripening by Abscisic Acid, Auxin, and Ethylene<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Polyamines (PAs) participate in many plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. However, it is not clear whether PAs play a role in the ripening of strawberry (<i>Fragaria ananassa</i>), a model nonclimacteric plant. Here, we found that the content of the PA spermine (Spm) increased more sharply after the onset of fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation than did that of the PAs putrescine (Put) or spermidine (Spd). Spm dominance in ripe fruit resulted from abundant transcripts of a strawberry <i>S</i>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-Met decarboxylase gene (<i>FaSAMDC</i>), which encodes an enzyme that generates a residue needed for PA biosynthesis. Exogenous Spm and Spd promoted fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, while exogenous Put and a SAMDC inhibitor inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Based on transcriptome data, up- and down-regulation of <i>FaSAMDC</i> expression promoted and inhibited ripening, respectively, which coincided with changes in several physiological parameters and their corresponding gene transcripts, including firmness, anthocyanin content, sugar content, polyamine content, auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and ethylene emission. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that FaSAMDC also had a high enzymatic activity with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> <sc>m</sc>. In conclusion, PAs, especially Spm, regulate strawberry fruit ripening in an ABA-dominated, IAA-participating, and ethylene-coordinated manner, and FaSAMDC plays an important role in ripening.</p>

Betaine Lipid Is Crucial for Adapting to Low Temperature and Phosphate Deficiency in <i>Nannochloropsis</i>
<p>Diacylglyceryl-<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the phosphatidylcholine in bacteria, fungi, algae, and basal land plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile microalga <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i>, DGTS contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is relatively scarce in phosphatidylcholine, implying that DGTS has a unique physiological role. In this study, we addressed the role of DGTS in <i>N. oceanica</i>. We identified two DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain configurations compared to previously identified DGTS synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth retardation under phosphate starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for DGTS in the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation to this condition. Under normal conditions, DGTS deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with high EPA content, whereas excessive production of DGTS induced by gene overexpression led to a decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in EPA biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing to acquire EPA or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The mutant lacking DGTS also displayed impaired growth and a lower proportion of EPA in extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results indicate that DGTS is involved in the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation to low temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the DGTS-dependent <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ation to phosphate starvation in <i>N. oceanica</i>.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ive responses.</p>

Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato, including <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">adapt</span></strong>ions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

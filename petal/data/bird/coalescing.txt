Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Preassembled GPCR signaling complexes mediate distinct cellular responses to ultralow ligand concentrations
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface signaling proteins, participate in nearly all physiological processes, and are the targets of 30% of marketed drugs. Typically, nanomolar to micromolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand are used to activate GPCRs in experimental systems. We detected GPCR responses to a wide range of ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, from attomolar to millimolar, by measuring GPCR-stimulated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mathematical modeling showed that femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand activated, on average, 40% of the cells in a population provided that a cell was activated by one to two binding events. Furthermore, activation of the endogenous β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (M<sub>3</sub>R) by femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand in cell lines and human cardiac fibroblasts caused sustained increases in nuclear translocation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively. These responses were spatially and temporally distinct from those that occurred in response to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand and resulted in a distinct cellular proteomic profile. This highly sensitive signaling depended on the GPCRs forming preassembled, higher-order signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. Recognizing that GPCRs respond to ultralow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of neurotransmitters and hormones challenges established paradigms of drug action and provides a previously unappreciated aspect of GPCR activation that is quite distinct from that typically observed with higher ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations.</p>

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil migration.</p>

Recurrent cortical circuits implement concentration-invariant odor coding
<p>Animals rely on olfaction to find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. To support these behaviors, they must be able to identify odors across different odorant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The neural circuit operations that implement this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation invariance remain unclear. We found that despite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependence in the olfactory bulb (OB), representations of odor identity were preserved downstream, in the piriform cortex (PCx). The OB cells responding earliest after inhalation drove robust responses in sparse subsets of PCx neurons. Recurrent collateral connections broadcast their activation across the PCx, recruiting global feedback inhibition that rapidly truncated and suppressed cortical activity for the remainder of the sniff, discounting the impact of slower, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependent OB inputs. Eliminating recurrent collateral output amplified PCx odor responses rendered the cortex steeply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependent and abolished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-invariant identity decoding.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Plasma Ceramides, Mediterranean Diet, and Incident Cardiovascular Disease in the PREDIMED Trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although in vitro studies and investigations in animal models and small clinical populations have suggested that ceramides may represent an intermediate link between overnutrition and certain pathological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), no prospective studies have investigated the association between plasma ceramides and risk of CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 980 participants from the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), including 230 incident cases of CVD and 787 randomly selected participants at baseline (including 37 overlapping cases) followed for ≤7.4 years. Participants were randomized to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. Plasma ceramide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were measured on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics platform. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.

The ceramide score, calculated as a weighted sum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of four ceramides, was associated with a 2.18-fold higher risk of CVD across extreme quartiles (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.36–3.49; <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.001). The association between baseline ceramide score and incident CVD varied significantly by treatment groups (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.010).

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p>Blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) generated by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets generated 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating blood cells generate networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

A cluster of immunoresolvents links coagulation to innate host defense in human blood
<p>Blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding upon blood vessel injury.

We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B<sub>4</sub>, and maresin 1, each of which was present at bioactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ating blood markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes and prostanoids, did not block the production of clot-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human blood targeted leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB signaling in neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Treatment of human WB with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by leukocytes. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic profiles for precision and personalized medicine.</p>

Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>
<p>The second messenger cyclic di–adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential in the Gram-positive model organism <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and in related pathogenic bacteria. It controls the activity of the conserved <i>ydaO</i> riboswitch and of several proteins involved in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) uptake. We found that the YdaO protein was conserved among several different bacteria and provide evidence that YdaO functions as a K<sup>+</sup> transporter. Thus, we renamed the gene and protein KimA (K<sup>+</sup> importer A). Reporter activity assays indicated that expression beyond the c-di-AMP–responsive riboswitch of the <i>kimA</i> upstream regulatory region occurred only in bacteria grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations.

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions.

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified.

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and distribution to different organs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in rice. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in older leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the rice heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the transformed yeast cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the redistribution of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in rice.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns and doses of insulin
<p>Secretion of insulin transiently increases after eating, resulting in a high circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Fasting limits insulin secretion, resulting in a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of insulin in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional responses to different temporal patterns and doses of insulin in the hepatoma FAO cells and identified 13 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated insulin-responsive genes (IRGs). The up-regulated IRGs responded more rapidly than did the down-regulated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in insulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, whereas the down-regulated IRGs were repressed at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of insulin than those required to stimulate the up-regulated IRGs. Mathematical modeling of the insulin response as two stages—(i) insulin signaling to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability—indicated that the first stage was the more rapid stage for the down-regulated IRGs, whereas the second stage of transcription was the more rapid stage for the up-regulated IRGs. A subset of the IRGs that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the FAO cells was similarly regulated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of insulin. Thus, not only can cells respond to insulin but they can also interpret the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant insulin production or tissue responsiveness.</p>

Stepwise phosphorylation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> receptor 1 defines cellular responses to leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>
<p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) receptor type 1 (BLT1) is abundant in phagocytic and immune cells and plays crucial roles in various inflammatory diseases. BLT1 is phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues upon stimulation with the inflammatory lipid LTB<sub>4</sub>. Using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate differentially phosphorylated forms of BLT1, we identified two distinct types of phosphorylation, basal and ligand-induced, in the carboxyl terminus of human BLT1. In the absence of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the basal phosphorylation sites were modified to various degrees, giving rise to many different phosphorylated forms of BLT1. Different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of LTB<sub>4</sub> induced distinct phosphorylation events, and these ligand-induced modifications facilitated additional phosphorylation events at the basal phosphorylation sites. Because neutrophils migrate toward inflammatory sites along a gradient of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the degree of BLT1 phosphorylation likely increases in parallel with the increase in LTB<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation as the cells migrate. At high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of LTB<sub>4</sub>, deficiencies in these two types of phosphorylation events impaired chemotaxis and β-hexosaminidase release, a proxy for degranulation, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, respectively. These results suggest that an LTB<sub>4</sub> gradient around inflammatory sites enhances BLT1 phosphorylation in a stepwise manner to facilitate the precise migration of phagocytic and immune cells and the initiation of local responses, including degranulation.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts.

How boundaries shape chemical delivery in microfluidics
<p>Many microfluidic systems—including chemical reaction, sample analysis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, chemotaxis, and drug development and injection—require control and precision of solute transport. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation levels are easily specified at injection, pressure-driven transport through channels is known to spread the initial distribution, resulting in reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations downstream. Here we document an unexpected phenomenon: The channel’s cross-sectional aspect ratio alone can control the shape of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation profile along the channel length. Thin channels (aspect ratio << 1) deliver solutes arriving with sharp fronts and tapering tails, whereas thick channels (aspect ratio ~ 1) produce the opposite effect. This occurs for rectangular and elliptical pipes, independent of initial distributions. Thus, it is possible to deliver solute with prescribed distributions, ranging from gradual buildup to sudden delivery, based only on the channel dimensions.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several transporters involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Extension of chemotactic pseudopods by nonadherent human neutrophils does not require or cause calcium bursts
<p>Global bursts in free intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are among the most conspicuous signaling events in immune cells. To test the common view that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the activation of G protein–coupled receptors, we combined single-cell manipulation with fluorescence imaging and monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in individual human neutrophils during complement-mediated chemotaxis. By decoupling purely chemotactic pseudopod formation from cell-substrate adhesion, we showed that physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of anaphylatoxins, such as C5a, induced nonadherent human neutrophils to form chemotactic pseudopods but did not elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts. By contrast, pathological or supraphysiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of C5a often triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts, but pseudopod protrusion stalled or reversed in such cases, effectively halting chemotaxis, similar to sepsis-associated neutrophil paralysis. The maximum increase in cell surface area during pseudopod extension in pure chemotaxis was much smaller—by a factor of 8—than the known capacity of adherent human neutrophils to expand their surface. Because the measured rise in cortical tension was not sufficient to account for this difference, we attribute the limited deformability to a reduced ability of the cytoskeleton to generate protrusive force in the absence of cell adhesion. Thus, we hypothesize that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts in neutrophils control a mechanistic switch between two distinct modes of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. A key element of this switch appears to be the expedient coordination of adhesion-dependent lock or release events of cytoskeletal membrane anchors.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The SWNT network physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the atomically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic molecules, and they retain stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation performance in tubular modules.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Homogenized halides and alkali cation segregation in alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites
<p>The role of the alkali metal cations in halide perovskite solar cells is not well understood. Using synchrotron-based nano–x-ray fluorescence and complementary measurements, we found that the halide distribution becomes homogenized upon addition of cesium iodide, either alone or with rubidium iodide, for substoichiometric, stoichiometric, and overstoichiometric preparations, where the lead halide is varied with respect to organic halide precursors. Halide homogenization coincides with long-lived charge carrier decays, spatially homogeneous carrier dynamics (as visualized by ultrafast microscopy), and improved photovoltaic device performance. We found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ated clusters. Alkali metals are beneficial at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, where they homogenize the halide distribution, but at higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, they form recombination-active second-phase clusters.</p>

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA.

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy

Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that surface materials were processed by the action of water within the interior.

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, reduced glycerol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other compounds had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

<sec><title>Increasing Turnover</title><p>Rising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are likely to stimulate plant growth, leading to increased biomass and soil carbon stocks, thereby lessening the rate of the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. <bold>Van Groenigen <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 508, published online 24 April) report the results of a meta-analysis and modeling that show that increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> also stimulates microbial decomposition of organic carbon in soils, by roughly the same amount that it increases soil organic carbon, leading to lower equilibrium soil carbon inventories and limiting the accumulation of carbon. Thus, soils may not provide as much carbon storage as hoped.</p></sec>

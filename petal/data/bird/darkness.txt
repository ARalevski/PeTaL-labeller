Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">darken</span></strong>ed leaf initiates senescence much more rapidly than a leaf from a whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">darken</span></strong>ed plant. Combining transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the metabolic strategies that are employed in response to different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">darken</span></strong>ing treatments. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">darken</span></strong>ed plant conditions, the perception of carbon starvation drove a profound metabolic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP production. Concomitantly, the increased accumulation of amino acids with a high nitrogen-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of metabolically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of nitrogen for use upon returning to typical growth conditions. Conversely, in individually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">darken</span></strong>ed leaf, the metabolic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of metabolites, including sugars and amino acids, between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">darken</span></strong>ed leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive metabolic shift in the substrates fueling mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic reactions facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific metabolic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">darken</span></strong>ing treatments, which support either rapid senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation in apple.</p>

Linking a mutation to survival in wild mice
<p>Adaptive evolution in new or changing environments can be difficult to predict because the functional connections between genotype, phenotype, and fitness are complex.

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% have mainly been demonstrated by using mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>) as an electron-transporting layer. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> can reduce the stability of PSCs under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation (including ultraviolet light). Lanthanum (La)–doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> (LBSO) perovskite would be an ideal replacement given its electron mobility and electronic structure, but LBSO cannot be synthesized as well-dispersible fine particles or crystallized below 500°C. We report a superoxide colloidal solution route for preparing a LBSO electrode under very mild conditions (below 300°C). The PSCs fabricated with LBSO and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) show a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2%, versus 19.7% for a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> device. The LBSO-based PSCs could retain 93% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full-Sun <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation.</p>

Efficient and stable solution-processed planar perovskite solar cells via contact passivation

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Night-Break Experiments Shed Light on the Photoperiod1-Mediated Flowering
<p>Plants utilize variation in day length (photoperiod) to anticipate seasonal changes. They respond by modulating their growth and development to maximize seed production, which in cereal crops is directly related to yield. In wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the acceleration of flowering under long days (LD) is dependent on the light induction of <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>PPD1</i>) by phytochromes. Under LD, <i>PPD1</i> activates <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> (<i>FT1</i>), a mobile signaling protein that travels from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem to promote flowering. Here, we show that the interruption of long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>s by short pulses of light (“<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>-break” [NB]) accelerates wheat flowering, suggesting that the duration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> is critical for wheat photoperiodic response. <i>PPD1</i> transcription was rapidly upregulated by NBs, and the magnitude of this induction increased with the length of darkness preceding the NB. Cycloheximide abolished the NB up-regulation of <i>PPD1</i>, suggesting that this process is dependent on active protein synthesis during darkness. While one NB was sufficient to induce <i>PPD1</i>, more than 15 NBs were required to induce high levels of <i>FT1</i> expression and a strong acceleration of flowering. Multiple NBs did not affect the expression of core circadian clock genes. The acceleration of flowering by NB disappeared in <i>ppd1-</i>null mutants, demonstrating that this response is mediated by <i>PPD1</i>. The acceleration of flowering was strongest when NBs were applied in the middle of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>, suggesting that in addition to <i>PPD1</i>, other circadian-controlled factors are required for the up-regulation of <i>FT1</i> expression and the acceleration of flowering.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology of one sex or species with the leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

German law allows use of DNA to predict suspects' looks

The controversial law, which passed the Landtag, the state parliament in Munich, on 15 May, is the first in Germany to allow what has been dubbed DNA phenotyping, and it has sparked renewed debate here and in other countries about the advantages—and risks—of the technology. German federal authorities, and police in the country's 15 other states, are only allowed to perform DNA fingerprinting, in which they look for an exact match between crime scene DNA and samples in a database of known criminals or from a suspect. DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction, however, have been used in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several U.S. states. Some critics caution that although the underlying science connecting genetic markers to certain physical features is solid, DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction still come with significant uncertainties that can be easily misunderstood by police and the public.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>s of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shadow</span></strong>s, and rapid variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties.</p>

Polyamines Regulate Strawberry Fruit Ripening by Abscisic Acid, Auxin, and Ethylene<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Polyamines (PAs) participate in many plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. However, it is not clear whether PAs play a role in the ripening of strawberry (<i>Fragaria ananassa</i>), a model nonclimacteric plant. Here, we found that the content of the PA spermine (Spm) increased more sharply after the onset of fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation than did that of the PAs putrescine (Put) or spermidine (Spd). Spm dominance in ripe fruit resulted from abundant transcripts of a strawberry <i>S</i>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-Met decarboxylase gene (<i>FaSAMDC</i>), which encodes an enzyme that generates a residue needed for PA biosynthesis. Exogenous Spm and Spd promoted fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, while exogenous Put and a SAMDC inhibitor inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Based on transcriptome data, up- and down-regulation of <i>FaSAMDC</i> expression promoted and inhibited ripening, respectively, which coincided with changes in several physiological parameters and their corresponding gene transcripts, including firmness, anthocyanin content, sugar content, polyamine content, auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and ethylene emission. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that FaSAMDC also had a high enzymatic activity with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> <sc>m</sc>. In conclusion, PAs, especially Spm, regulate strawberry fruit ripening in an ABA-dominated, IAA-participating, and ethylene-coordinated manner, and FaSAMDC plays an important role in ripening.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion growth and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion growth more directly. Expansion growth was faster at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>time. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes
<p>Ultralow-velocity zones are localized regions of extreme material properties detected seismologically at the base of Earth's mantle. Their nature and role in mantle dynamics are poorly understood.

Through waveform modeling, we detected a large ultralow-velocity zone and constrained its shape to be axisymmetric to a very good first order. We thus attribute it to partial melting of a locally thickened, denser- and hotter-than-average layer, reflecting dynamics and elevated temperatures within the plume root. Such structures are few and far apart, and they may be characteristic of the roots of some of the broad mantle plumes tomographically imaged within the large low-shear-velocity provinces in the lower mantle.</p>

In these structures, phenols are presented in a (supra-)molecular context dictated by the positions of the amino acids in the peptide sequence. Oxidative polymerization can be tuned in a sequence-dependent manner, resulting in peptide sequence–encoded properties such as UV absorbance, morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, and electrochemical properties over a considerable range. Short peptides have low barriers to application and can be easily scaled, suggesting near-term applications in cosmetics and biomedicine.</p>

Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus
<p>The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization.

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-transporting protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ate a general mechanistic framework for small molecule–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron transport. They also suggest that small molecules that partially mimic the function of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

Imaging the distribution of transient viscosity after the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake
<p>The deformation of mantle and crustal rocks in response to stress plays a crucial role in the distribution of seismic and volcanic hazards, controlling tectonic processes ranging from continental drift to earthquake triggering. However, the spatial variation of these dynamic properties is poorly understood as they are difficult to measure.

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> ice–rich surface area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> ice.

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to temperature, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer temperature accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of temperature perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-temperature response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-temperature transcriptome becomes derepressed at low temperatures. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a temperature-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to temperature in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate temperature information over the course of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>.</p>

Incorporation of rubidium cations into perovskite solar cells improves photovoltaic performance

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be oxidatively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-oxidative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains oxidized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 oxidation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 oxidation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 oxidation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 Coordinates CONSTANS to Delay Flowering by Recruiting the Transcriptional Corepressor TPR2
<p>ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 (AFP2) negatively regulates the abscisic acid signal by accelerating ABI5 degradation during seed germination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The abscisic acid signal is reported to delay flowering by up-regulating <i>Flowering Locus C</i> expression, but the role of AFP2 in regulating flowering time is unknown. Here, we found that flowering time was markedly delayed and <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) expression was reduced in a transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing <i>AFP2</i> under LD conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function <i>afp2</i> mutant showed slightly earlier flowering, with higher <i>CO</i> expression. These data suggest that <i>AFP2</i> negatively regulates photoperiod-dependent flowering time by modulating the CO signal. We then found that <i>AFP2</i> exhibited circadian expression rhythms that peaked during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>. Furthermore, the C-terminus of AFP2 interacted with CO, while its N-terminal ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motif interacted with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS-related protein2 (TPR2). Thus, AFP2 bridges CO and TPR2 to form the CO-AFP2-TPR2 complex. Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that AFP2 mediated CO degradation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>. AFP2 also recruited histone deacetylase activity at <i>Flowering Locus T</i> chromatin through its interaction with TPR2. Taken together, our results reveal an elaborate mechanism by which AFP2 modulates flowering time through coordinating the activity and stability of CO.</p>

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease resistance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.</p>

Pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays supported this conclusion. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that MdBT2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of MdMYB1 through a cullin protein MdCUL3-independent pathway. Expression analysis demonstrated that MdBT2 and MdMYB1 were inversely regulated by nitrate and other environmental signals. Furthermore, we used transgenic approaches in apple and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to characterize the function of <i>MdBT2</i> in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to nitrate.

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides chlorophyll for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of chlorophyll for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato

Subcellular Compartmentation of Alternatively Spliced Transcripts Defines <i>SERINE/ARGININE-RICH PROTEIN30</i> Expression<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Alternative splicing (AS) is prevalent in higher eukaryotes, and generation of different AS variants is tightly regulated. Widespread AS occurs in response to altered light conditions and plays a critical role in seedling photomorphogenesis, but despite its frequency and effect on plant development, the functional role of AS remains unknown for most splicing variants. Here, we characterized the light-dependent AS variants of the gene encoding the splicing regulator Ser/Arg-rich protein SR30 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We demonstrated that the splicing variant <i>SR30.2</i>, which is predominantly produced in darkness, is enriched within the nucleus and strongly depleted from ribosomes. Light-induced AS from a downstream 3′ splice site gives rise to <i>SR30.1</i>, which is exported to the cytosol and translated, coinciding with SR30 protein accumulation upon seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Constitutive expression of SR30.1 and SR30.2 fused to fluorescent proteins revealed their identical subcellular localization in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles. Furthermore, expression of either variant shifted splicing of a genomic <i>SR30</i> reporter toward <i>SR30.2</i>, suggesting that an autoregulatory feedback loop affects <i>SR30</i> splicing. We provide evidence that <i>SR30.2</i> can be further spliced and, unlike <i>SR30.2</i>, the resulting cassette exon variant <i>SR30.3</i> is sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay. Our work delivers insight into the complex and compartmentalized RNA processing mechanisms that control the expression of the splicing regulator SR30 in a light-dependent manner.</p>

Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of chlorophyll degradation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of chlorophyll.

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm

Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice.

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, damage due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII.

Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where damage is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive damage targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and attenuated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the attenuation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p>Fruit development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed dispersal, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong></i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of chlorophyll after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Oxidation of P700 in Photosystem I Is Essential for the Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>The photoinhibition of photosystem I (PSI) is lethal to oxygenic phototrophs. Nevertheless, it is unclear how photodamage occurs or how oxygenic phototrophs prevent it. Here, we provide evidence that keeping P700 (the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI) oxidized protects PSI. Previous studies have suggested that PSI photoinhibition does not occur in the two model cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942, when photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation was suppressed under low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure even in mutants deficient in flavodiiron protein (FLV), which mediates alternative electron flow. The lack of FLV in <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 (S. 7002), however, is linked directly to reduced growth and PSI photodamage under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions. Unlike <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC 7942, S. 7002 reduced P700 during CO<sub>2</sub>-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation in the absence of FLV, resulting in decreases in both PSI and photosynthetic activities. Even at normal air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the growth of S. 7002 mutant was retarded relative to that of the wild type. Therefore, P700 oxidation is essential for protecting PSI against photoinhibition. Here, we present various strategies to alleviate PSI photoinhibition in cyanobacteria.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified gene families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

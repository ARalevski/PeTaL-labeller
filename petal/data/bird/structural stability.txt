Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve.

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness.</p>

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall shear stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical testing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall shear stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-flow and stable flow were tested ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified transforming growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to transforming growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo testing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of transforming growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in shear-mediated arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β.

Experimentally Increasing Titin Compliance in a Novel Mouse Model Attenuates the Frank-Starling Mechanism But Has a Beneficial Effect on Diastole
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Experimentally upregulating compliant titins has been suggested as a therapeutic for lowering pathological diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness levels. However, how increasing titin compliance impacts global cardiac function requires in-depth study. We investigate the effect of upregulating compliant titins in a novel mouse model with a genetically altered titin splicing factor; integrative approaches were used from intact cardiomyocyte mechanics to pressure-volume analysis and Doppler echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Compliant titins were upregulated through deletion of the RNA Recognition Motif of the splicing factor RBM20 (<i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice). A genome-wide exon expression analysis and a candidate approach revealed that the phenotype is likely to be dominated by greatly increased lengths of titin’s spring elements. At both cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels, diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness was reduced in heterozygous (+/−) <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice with a further reduction in homozygous (−/−) mice at only the intact myocyte level. Fibrosis was present in only −/− <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> hearts. The Frank-Starling Mechanism was reduced in a graded fashion in <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> mice, at both the cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels. Exercise tests revealed an increase in exercise capacity in +/− mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Titin is not only important in diastolic but also in systolic cardiac function. Upregulating compliant titins reduces diastolic chamber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness owing to the increased compliance of myocytes, but it depresses end-systolic elastance; under conditions of exercise, the beneficial effects on diastolic function dominate. Therapeutic manipulation of the RBM20-based splicing system might be able to minimize effects on fibrosis and systolic function while improving the diastolic function in patients with heart failure.</p></sec>

Crk adaptor proteins mediate actin-dependent T cell migration and mechanosensing induced by the integrin LFA-1
<p>T cell entry into inflamed tissue involves firm adhesion, spreading, and migration of the T cells across endothelial barriers. These events depend on “outside-in” signals through which engaged integrins direct cytoskeletal reorganization. We investigated the molecular events that mediate this process and found that T cells from mice lacking expression of the adaptor protein Crk exhibited defects in phenotypes induced by the integrin lymphocyte function–associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), namely, actin polymerization, leading edge formation, and two-dimensional cell migration. Crk protein was an essential mediator of LFA-1 signaling–induced phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and its subsequent interaction with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit p85, thus promoting PI3K activity and cytoskeletal remodeling. In addition, we found that Crk proteins were required for T cells to respond to changes in substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness, as measured by alterations in cell spreading and differential phosphorylation of the force-sensitive protein CasL. These findings identify Crk proteins as key intermediates coupling LFA-1 signals to actin remodeling and provide mechanistic insights into how T cells sense and respond to substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness.</p>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction force microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force generation in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction force when encountering antigens presented by substrates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong>ity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction force generation and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction forces. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction force and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction forces than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction forces than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force during B cell activation.</p>

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked fluid shear stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. We showed that fluid shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T cell activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two cells and the activation of the T cells. Activated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>er cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong>ity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong>ly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.</p>

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness and extensibility; for example, strengthening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased toughness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy network. The iron-containing network exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the network enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Evidence for the Regulation of Gynoecium Morphogenesis by <i>ETTIN</i> via Cell Wall Dynamics
<p><i>ETTIN</i> (<i>ETT</i>) is an atypical member of the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR family of transcription factors that plays a crucial role in tissue patterning in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium. Though recent insights have provided valuable information on ETT’s interactions with other components of auxin signaling, the biophysical mechanisms linking ETT to its ultimate effects on gynoecium morphology were until now unknown. Here, using techniques to assess cell-wall dynamics during gynoecium growth and development, we provide a coherent body of evidence to support a model in which ETT controls the elongation of the valve tissues of the gynoecium through the positive regulation of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity in the cell wall. This increase in PME activity results in an increase in the level of demethylesterified pectins and a consequent reduction in cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness, leading to elongation of the valves. Though similar biophysical mechanisms have been shown to act in the stem apical meristem, leading to the expansion of organ primordia, our findings demonstrate that regulation of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness through the covalent modification of pectin also contributes to tissue patterning within a developing plant organ.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> fraction of GAX became more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

We introduce a pair of ultrathin, soft, skin-like electronic devices whose coordinated, wireless operation reproduces the functionality of these traditional technologies but bypasses their intrinsic limitations. The enabling advances in engineering science include designs that support wireless, battery-free operation; real-time, in-sensor data analytics; time-synchronized, continuous data streaming; soft mechanics and gentle adhesive interfaces to the skin; and compatibility with visual inspection and with medical imaging techniques used in the NICU. Preliminary studies on neonates admitted to operating NICUs demonstrate performance comparable to the most advanced clinical-standard monitoring systems.</p>

Fractal-like hierarchical organization of bone begins at the nanoscale
<p>The components of bone assemble hierarchically to provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness and toughness. However, the organization and relationship between bone’s principal components—mineral and collagen—has not been clearly elucidated. Using three-dimensional electron tomography imaging and high-resolution two-dimensional electron microscopy, we demonstrate that bone mineral is hierarchically assembled beginning at the nanoscale: Needle-shaped mineral units merge laterally to form platelets, and these are further organized into stacks of roughly parallel platelets. These stacks coalesce into aggregates that exceed the lateral dimensions of the collagen fibrils and span adjacent fibrils as continuous, cross-fibrillar mineralization. On the basis of these observations, we present a structural model of hierarchy and continuity for the mineral phase, which contributes to the structural integrity of bone.</p>

Enzymatic construction of highly strained carbocycles
<p>Small carbocycles are structurally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> and possess high intrinsic energy due to their ring strain. These features lead to broad applications but also create challenges for their construction. We report the engineering of hemeproteins that catalyze the formation of chiral bicyclobutanes, one of the most strained four-membered systems, via successive carbene addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. Enzymes that produce cyclopropenes, putative intermediates to the bicyclobutanes, were also identified. These genetically encoded proteins are readily optimized by directed evolution, function in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and act on structurally diverse substrates with high efficiency and selectivity, providing an effective route to many chiral strained structures. This biotransformation is easily performed at preparative scale, and the resulting strained carbocycles can be derivatized, opening myriad potential applications.</p>

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields
<p>Gas transport through metal-organic framework membranes (MOFs) was switched in situ by applying an external electric field (E-field). The switching of gas permeation upon E-field polarization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> lattices. Permeation measurements under a direct-current E-field poling of 500 volts per millimeter showed reversibly controlled switching of the ZIF-8 into polar polymorphs, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability. Dielectric spectroscopy, polarization, and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed low-frequency resonances of ZIF-8 that we attribute to lattice flexibility and linker movement.

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Self-assembly of genetically encoded DNA-protein hybrid nanoscale shapes
<p>We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimensional st</span></strong>ructural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-stranded DNA template into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong>ity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.</p>

Rogue protein's partners offer hope in Parkinson's disease
<p>It has been 8 years since an astonishing observation persuaded many scientists that the misfolded protein implicated in Parkinson's disease spreads from brain cell to brain cell, like an infection. Last week, findings presented at the huge annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience further buttressed the theory that spread of the rogue protein, called α-synuclein, is responsible for the progressive disease, which is marked by tremor, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong> movements, depression, and, ultimately, dementia. Scientists at the San Diego, California, conference also described their discovery that an obscure protein carried on the cell membranes of neurons and other brain cells blocks the uptake of the α-synuclein into cells. Little is known about TM9SF2, but it is part of a family of proteins that span the cell membrane and indications are that it may work to transport specific molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell. It is made in abundance in the brain, especially in regions where damage to dopamine-producing neurons is known to give rise to Parkinson's. If it emerges that it is indeed a "catcher's mitt" for α-synuclein, it could provide a drug target for a disease whose 10 million sufferers are sorely in need of new medicines. The same goes for another cell membrane protein, LAG-3, which is present in neurons and which was recently described in <i>Science </i>as binding tightly to the rogue Parkinson's protein.</p>

Posttranslational mutagenesis: A chemical strategy for exploring protein side-chain diversity
<p>Posttranslational modification of proteins expands their structural and functional capabilities beyond those directly specified by the genetic code. However, the vast diversity of chemically plausible (including unnatural but functionally relevant) side chains is not readily accessible. We describe C (sp<sup>3</sup>)–C (sp<sup>3</sup>) bond-forming reactions on proteins under biocompatible conditions, which exploit unusual carbon free-radical chemistry, and use them to form Cβ–Cγ bonds with altered side chains. We demonstrate how these transformations enable a wide diversity of natural, unnatural, posttranslationally modified (methylated, glycosylated, phosphorylated, hydroxylated), and labeled (fluorinated, isotopically labeled) side chains to be added to a common, readily accessible dehydroalanine precursor in a range of representative protein types and scaffolds. This approach, outside of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> constraints of the ribosome and enzymatic processing, may be modified more generally for access to diverse proteins.</p>

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear particles, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong>ity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Detainment of Tam3 Transposase at Plasma Membrane by Its BED-Zinc Finger Domain
<p>Transposable elements (TEs) are considered to be parasites of host genomes because they act as powerful mutagens. If not kept in check, they can cause gene disruption, genome rearrangement, and genomic takeover. Hence, activities of TEs are under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> control of hosts. To date, all identified TE regulations have been epigenetic dependent, with the exception of the DNA transposon Tam3. Blocking nuclear translocation of Tam3 transposase (TPase) is consistent with the suppression of Tam3 in <i>Antirrhinum majus</i>. In this article, we discovered that epigenetic-independent regulation of Tam3 is mediated by the BED-zinc finger (Znf-BED) domain of Tam3 TPase. The host targets the N terminus of the Znf-BED domain, which contains two highly conserved aromatic amino acids, to detain Tam3 TPase at the plasma membrane and to silence Tam3. Zinc finger proteins perform broader functions in transcriptional regulation through their DNA binding ability. Our data revealed that the posttranslational epigenetic-independent silencing against TEs was a result of the protein binding ability of the Znf-BED domain.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); control RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with control, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with controls, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between control and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between control, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve disease. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear. Here, we identified that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26) increases valvular calcification and promotes calcific aortic valve disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We obtained the aortic valve tissues from humans and murine models (wild-type and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice) and cultured the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and valvular endothelial cells from the cusps. We induced osteogenic differentiation in the primary cultured VICs and examined the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor on the osteogenic changes in vitro and aortic valve calcification in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice. We also induced calcific aortic stenosis in male New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) by a cholesterol-enriched diet+vitamin D2 (25 000 IU, daily). Echocardiography was performed to assess the aortic valve area and the maximal and mean transaortic pressure gradients at baseline and 3-week intervals thereafter. After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric oxide depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs. Consequently, the NF-κB promotes DPP-4 expression, which then induces the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. The inhibition of DPP-4 enzymatic activity blocked the osteogenic changes in VICs in vitro and reduced the aortic valve calcification in vivo in a mouse model. Sitagliptin administration in a rabbit calcific aortic valve disease model led to significant improvements in the rate of change in aortic valve area, transaortic peak velocity, and maximal and mean pressure gradients over 12 weeks. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the therapeutic effect of Sitagliptin in terms of reducing the calcium deposits in the rabbit aortic valve cusps. In rabbits receiving Sitagliptin, the plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 levels were significantly increased, in line with DPP-4 inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DPP-4-dependent insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibition in VICs contributes to aortic valve calcification, suggesting that DPP-4 could serve as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit calcific aortic valve disease progression.</p></sec>

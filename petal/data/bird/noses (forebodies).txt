The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid batsâ€”the great leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Avoiding topsy-turvy: how Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) fly through upward gusts
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Hummingbirds flying through intense upward gusts experience pronounced downward pitching motions (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong> dives). In response, they interrupt flapping, hold the wings dorsally, and angle and fan the tail.</p>

Directionality of nose-emitted echolocation calls from bats without a nose leaf (<i>Plecotus auritus</i>)
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Nose-emitting bats without an obvious means of emitting a narrow bio-sonar beam still emit a highly directional beam, potentially by emitting sound through the mouth as well as the nostrils.</p>

Kinematics of chisel-tooth digging by African mole-rats
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> During digging, mole-rats anchor their upper incisors in the soil while the lower incisors are lifted through the soil. A quick, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>-down rotation of the head finishes an excavation cycle.</p>

Role of ectodysplasin signalling in middle ear and nasal pathology in rat and mouse models of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The <i>Edaradd<sup>swh/swh</sup></i> rat has comparable ear, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong> and throat (ENT) pathology to humans with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and prenatal correction of EDAR signalling in <i>Eda<sup>Ta</sup></i> mice prevents ENT disease.</p>

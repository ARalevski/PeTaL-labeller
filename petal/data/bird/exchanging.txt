Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> (lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of temperate bacteriophages.</p>

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for patients with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0–1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of direct patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.92; <i>P</i>=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed directly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and direct routing to endovascular-capable centers for patients with severe stroke may improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Large, valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>
<p>Coherent interaction with off-resonance light can be used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> the energy levels of atoms, molecules, and solids. The dominant effect is the optical Stark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>, but there is an additional contribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> that has eluded direct and exclusive observation in solids. We observed an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) under infrared optical driving. By controlling the light helicity, we could confine the Bloch-Siegert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> to occur only at one valley, and the optical Stark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> at the other valley, because the two effects obey opposite selection rules at different valleys. Such a large and valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> allows for enhanced control over the valleytronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</p>

Systematic Biology
Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Plants send small RNAs in extracellular vesicles to fungal pathogen to silence virulence genes
<p>Some pathogens and pests deliver small RNAs (sRNAs) into host cells to suppress host immunity. Conversely, hosts also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> sRNAs into pathogens and pests to inhibit their virulence. Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red, especially from hosts to pathogens and pests, is still unknown. Here, we show that host <i>Arabidopsis</i> cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, <i>Arabidopsis</i> has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene

This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking.

This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> proteins reversibly bind different types of lipid molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospholipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular lipid composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and lipid-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration

Role of AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump in drug-resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer
<p>Drug-resistance dissemination by horizontal gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> remains poorly understood at the cellular scale. Using live-cell microscopy, we reveal the dynamics of resistance acquisition by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> fertility factor–conjugation plasmid encoding the tetracycline-efflux pump TetA. The entry of the single-stranded DNA plasmid into the recipient cell is rapidly followed by complementary-strand synthesis, plasmid-gene expression, and production of TetA. In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, resistance acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve resistance acquisition by plasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> in the presence of antibiotics with other modes of action.</p>

Structural basis for blue-green light harvesting and energy dissipation in diatoms
<p>Diatoms are abundant photosynthetic organisms in aquatic environments and contribute 40% of its primary productivity. An important factor that contributes to the success of diatoms is their fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs), which have exceptional light-harvesting and photoprotection capabilities. Here, we report the crystal structure of an FCP from the marine diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>, which reveals the binding of seven chlorophylls (Chls) a, two Chls c, seven fucoxanthins (Fxs), and probably one diadinoxanthin within the protein scaffold. Efficient energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> pathways can be found between Chl a and c, and each Fx is surrounded by Chls, enabling the energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> and quenching via Fx highly efficient.

A mechanism for preventing asymmetric histone segregation onto replicating DNA strands

The lagging-strand preference increases markedly in budding yeast cells lacking Dpb3 and Dpb4, two subunits of the leading strand DNA polymerase, Pol ε, owing to the impairment of parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> to leading strands. Dpb3-Dpb4 binds H3-H4 in vitro and participates in the inheritance of heterochromatin.

Classifying drivers of global forest loss

Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26%), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>ing agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%).

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses.

The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA.

Local transformations of the hippocampal cognitive map
<p>Grid cells are neurons active in multiple fields arranged in a hexagonal lattice and are thought to represent the “universal metric for space.” However, they become nonhomogeneously distorted in polarized enclosures, which challenges this view.

The grid remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s in simultaneously recorded colocalized grid fields were strongly correlated, which suggests that the readout of the animal’s position might still be intact.

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic.

In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain.

Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Mediating ER-mitochondrial cross-talk
<p>Cellular function and survival require the highly ordered subcellular localization of organelles. In particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the interconnectedness of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria.

Although the functional relevance of ER-mitochondrial tethering is widely accepted, identification of the proteins that constitute these interconnected structures has remained elusive. On page 623 of this issue, Hirabayashi <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) show that PDZ domain containing protein 8 (PDZD8) is required for the tethering of ER and mitochondrial membranes and is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> from ER to mitochondria.</p>

Learning-enhanced coupling between ripple oscillations in association cortices and hippocampus
<p>Consolidation of declarative memories requires hippocampal-neocortical communication. Although experimental evidence supports the role of sharp-wave ripples in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ring hippocampal information to the neocortex, the exact cortical destinations and the physiological mechanisms of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> are not known. We used a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to record local field potentials and neural spiking across the dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe recordings in the hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during sleep, concurrent with hippocampal ripples. Coupling between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was strengthened during sleep following learning. These findings suggest that ripple-ripple coupling supports hippocampal-association cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of memory traces.</p>

A Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock
<p>Strontium optical lattice clocks have the potential to simultaneously interrogate millions of atoms with a high spectroscopic quality factor of 4 × 10<sup>17</sup>. Previously, atomic interactions have forced a compromise between clock stability, which benefits from a large number of atoms, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s. Here we demonstrate a scalable solution that takes advantage of the high, correlated density of a degenerate Fermi gas in a three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice to guard against on-site interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s. We show that contact interactions are resolved so that their contribution to clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments. A synchronous clock comparison between two regions of the 3D lattice yields a measurement precision of 5 × 10<sup>–19</sup> in 1 hour of averaging time.</p>

Structure of a symmetric photosynthetic reaction center–photosystem
<p>Reaction centers are pigment-protein complexes that drive photosynthesis by converting light into chemical energy. It is believed that they arose once from a homodimeric protein. The symmetry of a homodimer is broken in heterodimeric reaction-center structures, such as those reported previously. The 2.2-angstrom resolution x-ray structure of the homodimeric reaction center–photosystem from the phototroph <i>Heliobacterium modesticaldum</i> exhibits perfect <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> symmetry. The core polypeptide dimer and two small subunits coordinate 54 bacteriochlorophylls and 2 carotenoids that capture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> energy to the electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> chain at the center, which performs charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and consists of 6 (bacterio)chlorophylls and an iron-sulfur cluster; unlike other reaction centers, it lacks a bound quinone. This structure preserves characteristics of the ancestral reaction center, providing insight into the evolution of photosynthesis.</p>

Plants transfer lipids to sustain colonization by mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic fungi
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi facilitate plant uptake of mineral nutrients and draw organic nutrients from the plant. Organic nutrients are thought to be supplied primarily in the form of sugars. Here we show that the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> is a fatty acid auxotroph and that fatty acids synthesized in the host plants are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red to the fungus to sustain mycorrhizal colonization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> is dependent on RAM2 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 2) and the ATP binding cassette transporter–mediated plant lipid export pathway. We further show that plant fatty acids can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red to the pathogenic fungus <i>Golovinomyces cichoracerum</i> and are required for colonization by pathogens. We suggest that the mutualistic mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi similarly recruit the fatty acid biosynthesis program to facilitate host invasion.</p>

Unequivocal determination of complex molecular structures using anisotropic NMR measurements

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of excited-state organometallic catalysis via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water.

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some auxin signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 auxin signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>ed in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s were from proximal to distal sites. Auxin treatment also caused PAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some auxin signaling components.</p>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic electron transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower electron transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emission, indicating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, electron donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. This suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Methyl Transfer in Glucosinolate Biosynthesis Mediated by Indole Glucosinolate <i>O</i>-Methyltransferase 5
<p>Indole glucosinolates (IGs) are plant secondary metabolites that are derived from the amino acid tryptophan. The product of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) IG core biosynthesis, indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (I3M), can be modified by hydroxylation and subsequent methoxylation of the indole ring in position 1 (1-IG modification) or 4 (4-IG modification). Products of the 4-IG modification pathway mediate plant-enemy interactions and are particularly important for Arabidopsis innate immunity. While <i>CYP81F</i>s encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and <i>IGMT</i>s encoding indole glucosinolate <i>O</i>-methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ases have been identified as key genes for IG modification, our knowledge about the IG modification pathways is not complete. In particular, it is unknown which enzyme is responsible for methyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> in the 1-IG modification pathway and whether this pathway plays a role in defense, similar to 4-IG modification. Here, we analyze two Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> DNA insertion lines with targeted metabolomics. We show that biosynthesis of 1-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (1MOI3M) from I3M involves the predicted unstable intermediate 1-hydroxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (1OHI3M) and that <i>IGMT5</i>, a gene with moderate similarity to previously characterized <i>IGMT</i>s, encodes the methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ase that is responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of 1OHI3M to 1MOI3M. Disruption of IGMT5 function increases resistance against the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne javanica</i> and suggests a potential role for the 1-IG modification pathway in Arabidopsis belowground defense.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>.</p>

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> protein) regulates the intermembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of phosphatidylcholine. Higher platelet PCTP expression is associated with increased platelet responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 thrombin receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects. Little is known about the regulation of platelet <i>PCTP</i>. Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet responses on activation. Platelet expression profiling of a patient with a <i>RUNX1</i> loss-of-function mutation revealed a 10-fold downregulation of the <i>PCTP</i> gene compared with healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We pursued the hypothesis that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1 and that <i>PCTP</i> expression is correlated with cardiovascular events. We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies. We assessed the relationship between <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>PCTP</i> in peripheral blood RNA and <i>PCTP</i> and death or myocardial infarction in 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate patient cohorts (587 total patients) with cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Platelet PCTP protein in the patient was reduced by ≈50%. DNA-protein binding studies showed RUNX1 binding to consensus sites in ≈1 kB of <i>PCTP</i> promoter. <i>PCTP</i> expression was increased with <i>RUNX1</i> overexpression and reduced with <i>RUNX1</i> knockdown in human erythroleukemia cells, indicating that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1. Studies in 2 cohorts of patients showed that <i>RUNX1</i> expression in blood correlated with <i>PCTP</i> gene expression; <i>PCTP</i> expression was higher in black compared with white subjects and was associated with future death/myocardial infarction after adjustment for age, sex, and race (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.6–2.7; <i>P</i><0.0001). <i>RUNX1</i> expression is known to initiate at 2 alternative promoters, a distal P1 and a proximal P2 promoter.

Furthermore, EVP displayed progenitor-like status with a high proportion of cells in a quiescent cell cycle phase as assessed in wounds, tumors, and aorta. Only EVP cells and not TA and D cells had self-renewal capacity as demonstrated by colony-forming capacity in limiting dilution and by transplantation in Matrigel plugs in recipient mice.

Furthermore, it is not known whether fibroblast dedifferentiation recapitulates the generation of multipotent progenitors during embryonic development, which give rise to endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages. Here we established the role of the developmental transcription factor SOX17 in regulating the bilineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of fibroblasts by the generation of intermediate progenitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors were generated after the dedifferentiation of human adult dermal fibroblasts by overexpression of pluripotency transcription factors. Sorted CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were transdifferentiated into induced endothelial cells and induced erythroblasts using lineage-specific growth factors. The therapeutic potential of the generated cells was assessed in an experimental model of myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Induced endothelial cells expressed specific endothelial cell surface markers and also exhibited the capacity for cell proliferation and neovascularization. Induced erythroblasts expressed erythroid surface markers and formed erythroid colonies. Endothelial lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion was dependent on the upregulation of the developmental transcription factor SOX17, whereas suppression of SOX17 instead directed the cells toward an erythroid fate. Implantation of these human bipotential CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice resulted in the formation of microvessels derived from human fibroblasts perfused with mouse and human erythrocytes. Endothelial cells generated from human fibroblasts also showed upregulation of telomerase. Cell implantation markedly improved vascularity and cardiac function after myocardial infarction without any evidence of teratoma formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Dedifferentiation of fibroblasts to intermediate CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors gives rise to endothelial cells and erythroblasts in a SOX17-dependent manner. These findings identify the intermediate CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor state as a critical bifurcation point, which can be tuned to generate functional blood vessels or erythrocytes and salvage ischemic tissue.</p></sec>

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer
<p>Relatively few catalytic systems are able to control the stereochemistry of electronically excited organic intermediates. Here we report the discovery that a chiral Lewis acid complex can catalyze triplet energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> from an electronically excited photosensitizer. We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate. We expect that this approach will enable chemists to more broadly apply their detailed understanding of chiral Lewis acid catalysis to stereocontrol in reactions involving electronically excited states.</p>

Detection of human adaptation during the past 2000 years
<p>Detection of recent natural selection is a challenging problem in population genetics. Here we introduce the singleton density score (SDS), a method to infer very recent changes in allele frequencies from contemporary genome sequences. Applied to data from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in the ancestors of modern Britons during the past ~2000 to 3000 years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and the major histocompatibility complex, and in favor of blond hair and blue eyes. For polygenic adaptation, we find that recent selection for increased height has driven allele frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s across most of the genome. Moreover, we identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s associated with other complex traits, suggesting that polygenic adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation in modern humans.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Intercellular communication and conjugation are mediated by ESX secretion systems in mycobacteria
<p>Communal bacterial processes require intercellular communication mediated by secretion systems to coordinate appropriate molecular responses. Intercellular communication has not been described previously in mycobacteria. Here we show that the ESX secretion-system family member ESX-4 is essential for conjugal recipient activity in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. Transcription of <i>esx4</i> genes in the recipient requires coculture with a donor strain and a functional ESX-1 apparatus in the recipient. Conversely, mutation of the donor ESX-1 apparatus amplifies the <i>esx4</i> transcriptional response in the recipient. The effect of ESX-1 on <i>esx4</i> transcription correlates with conjugal DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> efficiencies. Our data show that intercellular communication via ESX-1 controls the expression of its evolutionary progenitor, ESX-4, to promote conjugation between mycobacteria.</p>

Physiological and ecological drivers of early spring blooms of a coastal phytoplankter
<p>Climate affects the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms that fuel marine food webs and influence global biogeochemical cycles. Changes in bloom timing have been detected in some cases, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, contributing to uncertainty in long-term predictions of climate change impacts. Here we describe a 13-year hourly time series from the New England shelf of data on the coastal phytoplankter <i>Synechococcus</i>, during which the timing of its spring bloom varied by 4 weeks. We show that multiyear trends are due to temperature-induced changes in cell division rate, with earlier blooms driven by warmer spring water temperatures. <i>Synechococcus</i> loss rates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> in tandem with division rates, suggesting a balance between growth and loss that has persisted despite phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong>s and environmental change.</p>

Bifurcating electron-transfer pathways in DNA photolyases determine the repair quantum yield
<p>Photolyase is a blue-light–activated enzyme that repairs ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that occurs in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. Previous studies on microbial photolyases have revealed an electron-tunneling pathway that is critical for the repair mechanism. In this study, we used femtosecond spectroscopy to deconvolute seven electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> reactions in 10 elementary steps in all classes of CPD photolyases. We report a unified electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> pathway through a conserved structural configuration that bifurcates to favor direct tunneling in prokaryotes and a two-step hopping mechanism in eukaryotes. Both bifurcation routes are operative, but their relative contributions, dictated by the reduction potentials of the flavin cofactor and the substrate, determine the overall quantum yield of repair.</p>

Population Growth in a Wild Bird Is Buffered Against Phenological Mismatch
<sec><title>Balancing Act</title><p>Life cycles are strongly influenced by seasonal and interannual environmental and climate events.

Decameric SelA•tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> Ring Structure Reveals Mechanism of Bacterial Selenocysteine Formation

High-CO<sub>2</sub>/Hypoxia-Responsive Transcription Factors DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 Interact and Activate <i>DkPDC2</i> Promoter
<p>Identification and functional characterization of hypoxia-responsive transcription factors is important for understanding plant responses to natural anaerobic environments and during storage and transport of fresh horticultural products. In this study, yeast one-hybrid library screening using the persimmon (<i>Diospyros kaki</i>) pyruvate decarboxylase (<i>DkPDC2</i>) promoter identified three ethylene response factor (ERF) genes (<i>DkERF23</i>/<i>DkERF24</i>/<i>DkERF25</i>) and four WRKY transcription factor genes (<i>DkWRKY/DdkWRKY5</i>/<i>DkWRKY6</i>/<i>DkWRKY7</i>) that were differentially expressed in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> (95%, with 4% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen) and high N<sub>2</sub> (99% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen). Yeast one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shift</span></strong> assays indicated that DkERF23, DkERF24, DkERF25, DkWRKY6, and DkWRKY7 could directly bind to the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that these transcription factors were capable of transactivating the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 in combination synergistically transactivated the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter, and yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed protein–protein interaction between DkERF24 and DkWRKY1. Transient overexpression of <i>DkERF24</i> and <i>DkWRKY1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately and in combination in persimmon fruit discs was effective in maintaining insolubilization of tannins, concomitantly with the accumulation of DkPDC2 transcripts. Studies with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs <i>AtERF1</i> and <i>AtWRKY53</i> indicated that similar protein–protein interactions and synergistic regulatory effects also occur with the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. We propose that an ERF and WRKY transcription factor complex contributes to responses to hypoxia in both persimmon fruit and Arabidopsis, and the possibility that this is a general plant response requires further investigation.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

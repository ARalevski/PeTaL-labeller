Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier, we also compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelium. We identified genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier models.</p>

Supporting recovery from brain injury
<p>The beauty and intricacy of the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is unfortunately also mirrored by its vulnerability. Damage to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is typically permanent. Because cells of the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, apart from rare exceptions, no longer divide, there is essentially no regrowth of damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> tissue. Acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury in the majority of cases occurs directly through traumatic events such as an accident involving a blow to the head or indirectly through interruption of the blood supply, namely a stroke. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury is a major burden, with an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffering a traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury and nearly 800,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, current treatment options for such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injuries are still limited and are focused on the first hours after the insult. On page 50 of this issue, Abe <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a new approach in mouse and primate models that aims to enhance the ability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> to regain functionality in the days and weeks after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury.</p>

New dimensions for brain mapping
<p>The representation of memory in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is one of the unresolved questions in neuroscience. A key feature of learning and memory is the process of neuroplasticity—the ability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> to remodel structurally and functionally as a result of cognitive experience. Although the neurobiological basis of this process (that is, synaptic plasticity) is well established, the system level dynamics of neuroplasticity are still unclear. Recently, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), which can be carried out noninvasively in humans, provided a new approach to explore neuroplasticity. One of the parameters extracted from DW-MRI is mean diffusivity (MD) of water molecules, which is a biomarker of tissue microstructure (<i>1</i>). By probing changes in MD across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, areas of microstructural plasticity can be detected within hours of learning. On page 1045 of this issue, Brodt <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) used DW-MRI after an object-location memory task and found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> plasticity occurs in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) rather than in the hippocampus. Furthermore, they demonstrated that localized DW-MRI changes follow the basic definition of a memory engram (the physical manifestation of memories stored in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>). These observations go beyond the understanding of memory representation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Probing MD with DW-MRI appears to provide a detailed and comprehensive monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> microanatomy, revealing uncharted relations between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> structure and function.</p>

Astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles regulate the peripheral leukocyte response to inflammatory brain lesions
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury induces a peripheral acute cytokine response that directs the transmigration of leukocytes into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Because this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-to-peripheral immune communication affects patient recovery, understanding its regulation is important. Using a mouse model of inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury, we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of leukocytes through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine response. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein and microRNA cargo of EVs identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> by inhibiting PPARα, resulting in the increase of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity that triggered the production of cytokines in liver. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating communication between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> damage.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> pressures. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>.</p>

Assembling human brain organoids
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development is a remarkable self-organization process in which cells proliferate, differentiate, migrate, and wire to form functional neural circuits. In humans, this process takes place over a long fetal phase and continues into the postnatal period, but it is largely inaccessible for direct, functional investigation at a cellular level. Therefore, the features that make the human central nervous system unique and the sequence of molecular and cellular events underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> disorders remain largely uncharted. Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells, including those obtained by reprogramming somatic cells, have the ability to self-organize and differentiate when grown in three-dimensional (3D) aggregates rather than in direct contact with a flat plastic surface (<i>1</i>). Such 3D neural cultures, also known as organoids and organ spheroids, recapitulate many aspects of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development in vitro (<i>1</i>) and have the potential to accelerate progress in human neurobiology. Here, I discuss the emerging approaches to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> assembloids—the next generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> organoids that combine multiple cell lineages in 3D. These cultures can be used to model interactions between various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions in vitro, and ultimately may be applied to understand the assembly of neural circuits and to capture complex cell-cell interactions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>.</p>

Normative brain size variation and brain shape diversity in humans
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size variation over primate evolution and human development is associated with shifts in the proportions of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions. Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size can vary almost twofold among typically developing humans, but the consequences of this for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> organization remain poorly understood. Using in vivo neuroimaging data from more than 3000 individuals, we find that larger human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s show greater areal expansion in distributed frontoparietal cortical networks and related subcortical regions than in limbic, sensory, and motor systems. This areal redistribution recapitulates cortical remodeling across evolution, manifests by early childhood in humans, and is linked to multiple markers of heightened metabolic cost and neuronal connectivity. Thus, human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> shape is systematically coupled to naturally occurring variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size through a scaling map that integrates spatiotemporally diverse aspects of neurobiology.</p>

Watching the teen brain grow
<p>Adolescence is a time of extraordinarily important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> changes. And thanks to an unprecedented study now being launched, scientists will be able to examine those changes in depth, using MRI to define what normal growth looks like—and helping clarify what can go awry in teenage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s. The Adolescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> Cognitive Development Study—or ABCD Study—is a $300 million effort funded by the National Institutes of Health that will scan the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s of some 10,000 U.S. youths, beginning when they are 9 and 10 years old and imaging them every 2 years for 10 years. In addition to collecting scans of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> structure and function, the research teams at 21 study sites around the country will regularly gather a trove of other information from each youngster, from psychological, cognitive, and environmental data to biological specimens such as DNA. The hope is that by enrolling children young, before influences like substance use and sports injuries kick in, scientists will be able to untangle chicken-and-egg questions that correlational studies can't—questions about everything from mental illness to the impact of marijuana on the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. The response so far has been encouraging: Two-thirds of the way through a 2-year enrollment period that ends in September, the researchers have signed up more than 6800 children. And anonymized data from the first 4500 of them are due to be deposited in a publicly accessible database later this month.</p>

Adult neurogenesis in mammals
<p>The first claim, in the early 1960s, that neurons could be generated in the postnatal mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> was met with considerable skepticism and controversy (<i>1</i>). Over the next 20 years, each subsequent study reporting adult neurogenesis in the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> was greeted similarly (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). A dogma had been established and accepted by the scientific community: After birth, no new neurons could be generated. Conceptually, it was thought that the structural composition of the neurons within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> remained unchangeable after birth. However, the detection of adult neurogenesis in certain regions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> suggested that the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> exhibits more plasticity than previously thought, and this has implications for concepts of self, memory, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Early life experience shapes neural genome
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is constantly changing in response to environmental experiences throughout life.

Loss of a mammalian circular RNA locus causes miRNA deregulation and affects brain function
<p>Hundreds of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant in the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, often with conserved expression. Here we show that the circRNA Cdr1as is massively bound by the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-7 and miR-671 in human and mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s. When the <i>Cdr1as</i> locus was removed from the mouse genome, knockout animals displayed impaired sensorimotor gating—a deficit in the ability to filter out unnecessary information—which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological recordings revealed dysfunctional synaptic transmission. Expression of miR-7 and miR-671 was specifically and posttranscriptionally misregulated in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions analyzed. Expression of immediate early genes such as <i>Fos</i>, a direct miR-7 target, was enhanced in <i>Cdr1as</i>-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s, providing a possible molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. Our data indicate an in vivo loss-of-function circRNA phenotype and suggest that interactions between Cdr1as and miRNAs are important for normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> function.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>. THA was also found in hindgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and excreted rectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong></span></strong>, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

Brain Emboli After Left Ventricular Endocardial Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to cardioversions and numerous ablation lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but cerebral embolic risk in ventricular ablation has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled 18 consecutive patients meeting study criteria scheduled for ventricular tachycardia or PVC ablation over a 9-month period. Patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) ablation were compared with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular ablation only. Patients were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for ablation in all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> MRI was performed on each patient within a week of the ablation procedure.

Seven patients (58%) undergoing LV ablation experienced a total of 16 cerebral emboli, in comparison with zero patients undergoing right ventricular ablation (<i>P</i>=0.04).

Nonacute ischemic white matter changes on T2-weighted imaging, focal tissue loss, and ventriculomegaly were all more commonly detected in BDG and Fontan compared with pre-BDG patients (<i>P</i><0.05). BDG patients had significantly higher cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients. The odds of discovering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury with adjustment for surgical stage as well as ≥2 coexisting lesions within a patient decreased (63%–75% and 44%, respectively) with increasing amount of cerebral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05). In general, there was no association of oxygen delivery (except for ventriculomegaly in the BDG group) or carbon dioxide reactivity with neurological injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> abnormalities are commonly present in patients with a single ventricle, and detection of these lesions increases as children progress through staged surgical reconstruction, with multiple coexisting lesions more common earlier than later. In addition, this study demonstrated that BDG patients had greater cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients and that an inverse association exists of various indexes of cerebral blood flow with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> lesions. However, CO<sub>2</sub> reactivity and oxygen delivery (with 1 exception) were not associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> lesion development.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Glutathione <i>S</i>-transferases promote proinflammatory astrocyte-microglia communication during brain inflammation
<p>Astrocytes and microglia play critical roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> inflammation. Here, we report that glutathione <i>S</i>-transferases (GSTs), particularly GSTM1, promote proinflammatory signaling in astrocytes and contribute to astrocyte-mediated microglia activation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> inflammation. In vivo, astrocyte-specific knockdown of GSTM1 in the prefrontal cortex attenuated microglia activation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> inflammation induced by systemic injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Knocking down GSTM1 in astrocytes also attenuated LPS-induced production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) by microglia when the two cell types were cocultured. In astrocytes, GSTM1 was required for the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), both of which enhance microglia activation. Our study suggests that GSTs play a proinflammatory role in priming astrocytes and enhancing microglia activation in a microglia-astrocyte positive feedback loop during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> inflammation.</p>

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. We showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field
<p>A study published this week offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can sense Earth's magnetic field. But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious magnetic sense, do we ever use it? And does it arise from an iron mineral found in our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s, as the authors believe? The experiment recorded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled magnetic field equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> waves of a certain frequency. But some researchers aren't convinced that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>'s reaction to a magnetic field represents a true "sense" unless this reaction also guides our behavior.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain
<p>Disorders of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.</p>

Scaling of human brain size
<p>What makes humans unique as a species and as individuals? Our uniqueness stems from language, tool use, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities that are largely mediated by specialized regions of the cerebral cortex. These regions of higher cognitive function have expanded disproportionately during human evolution (compared with nonhuman primates) and during postnatal maturation, when cortical surface area expands threefold between infancy and adulthood (<i>1</i>). Our uniqueness as individuals reflects countless differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> structure, function, and connectivity. One basic anatomical difference between similarly aged individuals is a more than 1.5-fold variation in total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size (and total cortical volume) (<i>2</i>). On page 1222 of this issue, Reardon <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) bring this aspect of individual variability under the umbrella of “differential scaling” by showing that human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s of different sizes do not scale uniformly across all regions. Rather, larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s show greater expansion in regions associated with higher cognition and less expansion in regions associated with sensory, motor, and limbic (emotion- and affect-related) functions.</p>

Molecular and cellular reorganization of neural circuits in the human lineage

Cell cycle proteins moonlight in multiciliogenesis
<p>Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are a specialized population of postmitotic cells that are decorated with tens to hundreds of hairlike protrusions, termed motile cilia, that beat back and forth to direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> flow across an epithelium (<i>1</i>). MCCs line the respiratory tract, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> ventricles, and reproductive tracts of vertebrates and play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis; defects in the formation or movement of motile cilia can cause fertility defects, chronic respiratory infections, and/or a buildup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Despite their importance to human health, the pathways controlling the production of motile cilia in differentiating MCCs remain poorly understood. On page 803 of this issue, Al Jord <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) shed light on this question by showing that multiciliated progenitor cells implement components of the mitotic cell cycle machinery to coordinate events that are required for motile ciliation and cellular differentiation, while avoiding cell division (mitosis).</p>

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling geophysical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, and plasmas.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real flows.</p>

Breathing to inspire and arouse
<p>Breathing is one of the perpetual rhythms of life that is often taken for granted, its apparent simplicity belying the complex neural machinery involved. This behavior is more complicated than just producing inspiration, as breathing is integrated with many other motor functions such as vocalization, orofacial motor behaviors, emotional expression (laughing and crying), and locomotion (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, cognition can strongly influence breathing. Conscious breathing during yoga, meditation, or psychotherapy can modulate emotion, arousal state, or stress (<i>3</i>). Therefore, understanding the links between breathing behavior, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> arousal state, and higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> activity is of great interest. On page 1411 of this issue, Yackle <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) identify an apparently specialized, molecularly identifiable, small subset of ∼350 neurons in the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> that forms a circuit for transmitting information about respiratory activity to other central nervous system neurons, specifically with a group of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>stem, that influences arousal state (see the figure). This finding provides new insight into how the motor act of breathing can influence higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> functions.</p>

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale machines and micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>ic devices. Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s can be used to engineer self-organized soft machines.</p>

Rogue protein's partners offer hope in Parkinson's disease
<p>It has been 8 years since an astonishing observation persuaded many scientists that the misfolded protein implicated in Parkinson's disease spreads from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell, like an infection. Last week, findings presented at the huge annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience further buttressed the theory that spread of the rogue protein, called α-synuclein, is responsible for the progressive disease, which is marked by tremor, stiff movements, depression, and, ultimately, dementia. Scientists at the San Diego, California, conference also described their discovery that an obscure protein carried on the cell membranes of neurons and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cells blocks the uptake of the α-synuclein into cells. Little is known about TM9SF2, but it is part of a family of proteins that span the cell membrane and indications are that it may work to transport specific molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell. It is made in abundance in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, especially in regions where damage to dopamine-producing neurons is known to give rise to Parkinson's. If it emerges that it is indeed a "catcher's mitt" for α-synuclein, it could provide a drug target for a disease whose 10 million sufferers are sorely in need of new medicines. The same goes for another cell membrane protein, LAG-3, which is present in neurons and which was recently described in <i>Science </i>as binding tightly to the rogue Parkinson's protein.</p>

How the body learns to hurt
<p>After 50 years, the neuroscience of pain has a new player. In 1966, researchers traced how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> learns from repeated stimulation. They found that triggering neurons in one part of the hippocampus—a sliver of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> tissue key to memory—can make linked, distant neurons more likely to fire for many hours afterward, a phenomenon now known as long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP leaves its mark by strengthening some connections between synapses–the connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cells—and not others. Now, researchers have found a new type of LTP that may explain how pain itself "teaches" the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. The pain-related LTP is driven not by neuronal activity, but by glia—nonneuronal cells that protect neurons from injury, among other duties.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis

To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, including the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

A Trace of Your Place

Teasing out the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> signals that course through these networks is tremendously difficult because the number and nature of pathways in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> that give rise to a particular signal—the afferent inputs—are often not known. This becomes even more complicated if one looks for connectivity along these pathways at the level of single neurons, the most elementary operating units in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, because of the thousands of connections a neuron can make with other neurons. On page 44 of this issue, Zhang <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) tackle this question by identifying the afferent cells in the entorhinal cortex—a region associated with navigation and memory—that send signals to the hippocampus, specifically to “place cells,” neurons that become active in response to a specific location in an environment.

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and, therefore, contributed to human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> evolution.</p>

Many researchers remain skeptical on both counts. But three groups shared evidence that reprogrammed astrocytes do, at least in some respects, impersonate the neurons they're meant to replace. And two of them shared findings suggesting reprogrammed astrocytes help mice recover movement lost after a stroke.</p>

Brain scientists dive into deep neural networks
<p>At the Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience this month, researchers presented new tools for comparing data collected from living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s with readouts from computational models known as deep neural networks. Such comparisons might offer up new hypotheses about how humans interpret sights and sounds, understand language, or navigate the world. Until recently, artificial intelligence couldn't come anywhere close to human performance on tasks like recognizing sounds or classifying images. But deep neural networks, loosely inspired by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, have logged increasingly impressive performances, especially on visual tasks. That has led some neuroscientists to wonder whether these models could yield insight into how our own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s process information.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> metallic hydrogen occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior metallic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> deuterium to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to metal-like reflectivity (exceeding 30%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin. Our measurements and analysis address existing discrepancies between static and dynamic experiments for the insulator-metal transition in dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> hydrogen isotopes. They also provide new benchmarks for the theoretical calculations used to construct planetary models.</p>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>ity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to liquid crystals, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent building blocks. We dispersed micrometer-long inorganic colloidal rods in a nematic liquid crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> of molecular rods. Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, in which like-sized rods are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal rods. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase diagram with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of rods. Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

The controversial correlates of consciousness
<p>The mechanism of consciousness is one of the most fundamental, exciting, and challenging pursuits in 21st-century science. Although the field of consciousness studies attracts a diverse array of thinkers who posit myriad physical or metaphysical substrates for experience, consciousness must have a neural basis. But where in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is conscious experience generated? It would seem that, given this remarkable era of technical and experimental prowess in the neurosciences, we would be homing in on the specific circuits or precise neuronal subpopulations that generate experience. To the contrary, there is still active debate as to whether the neural correlates of consciousness are, in coarse terms, located in the back or the front of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). On page 537 of this issue, van Vugt <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is one of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions that mediates visual consciousness. Additionally, Joglekar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is important for igniting neural networks that contribute to visual signal processing. Both studies support a model for consciousness that involves distributed and reciprocal interactions across the cortex.</p>

Making room for new memories
<p>What are our memories made of? Plato suggested imagining a block of wax in our soul, where perceptions and thoughts leave impressions that we can remember as long as they have not been erased. This historic metaphor captures the transience of some memories and the stability of others, and it illustrates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>'s plasticity. The mechanisms of memory formation and retention remain a key question in neuroscience. Groundbreaking work on the rodent hippocampus (a network in the temporal lobe) revealed that certain neurons form transiently stable representations of places (<i>1</i>). Hence, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> region has become an important focus for studying spatial memory (or engram) formation. It also serves as an experimentally accessible proxy for declarative (knowledge) and episodic (experience) memory in humans, which involves the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> structures and mechanisms. However, how can we remember an almost infinite number of items with the limited storage capacity of the hippocampus? There is good evidence that relevant representations are transferred to neocortical networks before forming long-lasting engrams. The hippocampus is then reset for acquisition of new memories. Studies in animals (<i>2</i>) and humans (<i>3</i>) show that neuronal activity during sleep plays a major role in these processes. The underlying mechanisms, however, have remained mostly enigmatic. On page 1524 of this issue, Norimoto <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how sleep-associated activity patterns induce “negative” neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, erasing remote memories. A previous, related paper by Khodagholy <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) reveals similar activity patterns in the neocortex, which, hence, may mediate long-term consolidation of transient engrams at their final location.</p>

Early life experience drives structural variation of neural genomes in mice
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is a genomic mosaic owing to somatic mutations that arise throughout development. Mobile genetic elements, including retrotransposons, are one source of somatic mosaicism in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Retrotransposition may represent a form of plasticity in response to experience. Here, we use droplet digital polymerase chain reaction to show that natural variations in maternal care mediate the mobilization of long interspersed nuclear element–1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons in the hippocampus of the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Increasing the amount of maternal care blocks the accumulation of L1. Maternal care also alters DNA methylation at YY1 binding sites implicated in L1 activation and affects expression of the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a. Our observations indicate that early life experience drives somatic variation in the genome via L1 retrotransposons.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.</p>

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> contains diverse neuronal types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we identified regulatory elements with differential methylation across neuron types. Methylation signatures identified a layer 6 excitatory neuron subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neuron subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of regulatory elements in inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons. Single-nucleus methylomes expand the atlas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell types and identify regulatory elements that drive conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell diversity.</p>

Elderly chimps may get Alzheimer's disease
<p>Researchers have discovered tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease in 20 elderly chimpanzee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s, rekindling a decades-old debate over whether humans are the only species that develop the debilitating condition. By examining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions afflicted by Alzheimer's in humans, the team discovered that 13 chimps had amyloid plaques, and four also had the neurofibrillary tangles typical of more advanced stages of Alzheimer's. Whether chimps actually succumb to Alzheimer's or are immune from symptoms despite having the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> abnormalities is unclear, because there were no behavioral data to indicate that these animals developed dementia. But either way, the work suggests that chimps could help scientists better understand the disease and how to fight it. And although some scientists are eager to begin new studies on chimps, but many wonder whether such research on these now-endangered animals will receive moral, or monetary, support.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this disease is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> that are believed to be associated with pathogenesis—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using immunological or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the disease course. In addition, treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative diseases, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has shown limited or no effect on disease progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the immune system, including the resident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.</p>

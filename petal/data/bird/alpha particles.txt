An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> excurs<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer coordinate by means of two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s induce fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> double-minimum potential. Within the lifetime of a particular hydrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> geometry, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> explores a multitude of posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is strongly damped by its 20- to 40-femtosecond populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> decay. Our results suggest a central role of Zundel-like geometries in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> solvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belts, which have been observed outside its rings. Whether stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belts exist near the planet and inward of the rings was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belt that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmosphere and is decoupled from the rest of the magnetosphere by the planet’s A- to C-rings. The belt extends across the D-ring and comprises <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s produced through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmic ray</span></strong> albedo neutron decay and multiple charge-exchange react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> deplet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling draws heat from surfaces and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>es it into space as infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with wear.

Chloride Sensing by WNK1 Involves Inhibition of Autophosphorylation
<sec><title>Inhibited by Chloride in the Active Site</title><p>Chloride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are essential for regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis.

Synchrotron radiation from an accelerating light pulse

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair.

Using DNA, radiation therapy gets personal
<p>At most cancer hospitals today, medical oncologists routinely order genetic tests that help guide their drug treatment decis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. But down the hallway in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ward, cancer patients typically get a one-size-fits-all course of radiotherapy, regardless of their genetics or those of their cancer.

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma

We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of energy transfer in interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s associated with electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cyclotron waves.

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izing radi</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izing radi</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izing radi</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exposure.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass. The anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-photon transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> frequencies of anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">helium</span></strong>. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">helium</span></strong> atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">helium</span></strong> gas; the narrow thermal distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> led to the observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width.

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and also posttranscript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, BBX31 promotes the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by regulating genes involved in photoprotect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner.

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation

Rapid morphological and ecological evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, although this remains untested.

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Complete steric exclusion of ions and proton transport through confined monolayer water

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boson</span></strong> coupling plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) superconductors, its relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between the superconducting gap and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boson</span></strong>ic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boson</span></strong>ic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger superconductivity.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits

We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility.

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots

We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2.

However, the vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al spectra of cold, composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coordinate along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor molecules (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water molecule.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and a comparison with atmospheric observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s show that nearly all nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to sulfuric acid. A considerable fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, but the relatively weak dependence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicates that for the processes studied, variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmic ray</span></strong> intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model of the react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the model under different experimental condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s suggested that there are strong interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between ATP synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force was highly regulated by the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force under condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> affects leaf growth in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B levels present in solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> inhibit maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf growth without causing any other visible stress symptoms, including the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell divis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to understand the impact of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed leaves is a consequence of a reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in cell product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of GRF1 and possibly other transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors of the GRF family.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of energy for photochemical light convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and photoprotect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with PAM fluorescence under natural solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship differed substantially from that observed for convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

We used time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography at an x-ray free electron laser to visualize conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al changes in bR from nanoseconds to milliseconds following photoactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. An initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a conserved tryptophan residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic side of the protein while dislodging a key water molecule on the extracellular side. The resulting cascade of structural changes throughout the protein shows how mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are choreographed as bR transports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s uphill against a transmembrane concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> gradient.</p>

Ultrafast electron diffraction imaging of bond breaking in di-ionized acetylene
<p>Visualizing chemical react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as they occur requires atomic spatial and femtosecond temporal resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Here, we report imaging of the molecular structure of acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) 9 femtoseconds after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Using mid-infrared laser–induced electron diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (LIED), we obtained snapshots as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> departs the [C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. By introducing an addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al laser field, we also demonstrate control over the ultrafast dissociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> process and resolve different bond dynamics for molecules oriented parallel versus perpendicular to the LIED field. These measurements are in excellent agreement with a quantum chemical descript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of field-dressed molecular dynamics.</p>

Identification of LRRC8 Heteromers as an Essential Component of the Volume-Regulated Anion Channel VRAC
<sec><title>One Swell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Channel</title><p>When mammalian cells are faced with osmotic challenges, they need to swell or shrink. The molecular characterizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the volume-regulated an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel (VRAC) remains unknown, although many candidate proteins have been proposed. <bold>Voss <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 634, published online 10 April; see the Perspective by <bold>Mindell</bold>) used a genome-wide screen to identify a group of leucine-rich repeat–containing (LRRC) proteins necessary for forming VRAC. Suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of LRRC8A nearly eliminated the presence of VRAC in mammalian cells. A heterooligomer of LRRC proteins appears to form VRAC. Identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of VRAC components is an essential step forward in the understanding of swelling-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and provides opportunities for understanding both the mechanism of the channel and its role in physiology.</p></sec>

Unusual Roles of Secretory SNARE SYP132 in Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Traffic and Vegetative Plant Growth
<p>The plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> (H<sup>+</sup>)-ATPases of plants generate steep electrochemical gradients and activate osmotic solute uptake. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> pumping orchestrates cellular homeostasis and is a prerequisite for plastic cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant growth. All evidence suggests that the populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane reflects a balance of their roles in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling. Auxin governs both traffic and activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins already present at the membrane. As in other eukaryotes, in plants, SNARE-mediated membrane traffic influences the density of several proteins at the plasma membrane. Even so, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic, its relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with SNAREs, and its regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by auxin have remained enigmatic. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Qa-SNARE SYP132 (Syntaxin of Plants132) as a key factor in H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and demonstrate its associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with endocytosis. SYP132 is a low-abundant, secretory SNARE that primarily localizes to the plasma membrane. We find that <i>SYP132</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is tightly regulated by auxin and that augmented SYP132 express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> reduces the amount of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane. The physiological consequences of SYP132 overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> include reduced apoplast acidificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and suppressed vegetative growth. Thus, SYP132 plays unexpected and vital roles in auxin-regulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and associated funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at the plasma membrane.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and are critical for cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant stress acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. To test the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was associated with an increased accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradient and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restrict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restrict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

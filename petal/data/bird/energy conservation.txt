Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist
<p>Mechanical energy harvesters are needed for diverse applications, including self-powered wireless sensors, structural and human health monitoring systems, and the extraction of energy from ocean waves. We report carbon nanotube yarn harvesters that electrochemically convert tensile or torsional mechanical energy into electrical energy without requiring an external bias voltage. Stretching coiled yarns generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak electrical power when cycled up to 30 hertz, as well as up to 41.2 joules per kilogram of electrical energy per mechanical cycle, when normalized to harvester yarn weight. These energy harvesters were used in the ocean to harvest wave energy, combined with thermally driven artificial muscles to convert temperature fluctuations to electrical energy, sewn into textiles for use as self-powered respiration sensors, and used to power a light-emitting diode and to charge a storage capacitor.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed novel motifs; however, relatively fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across plants, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation among diverse plant groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among plants, and suggests their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle activity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell differentiation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell differentiation. We investigated how the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast differentiation increased cell mitochondrial activity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast differentiation was associated with an increase in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode corrosion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most corrosion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit corrosion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in corrosion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle acceleration by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such wave-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via wave-particle interactions.</p>

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

Density functional theory is straying from the path toward the exact functional
<p>The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)

Free-swimming northern elephant seals have low field metabolic rates that are sensitive to an increased cost of transport
<p>Widely ranging marine predators often adopt stereotyped, energy-saving behaviours to minimize the energetic cost of transport while maximizing energy gain. Environmental and anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt energy balance by prompting avoidance behaviours that increase transport costs, thereby decreasing foraging efficiency. We examined the ability of 12 free-ranging, juvenile northern elephant seals (<i>Mirounga angustirostris</i>) to mitigate the effects of experimentally increased transport costs by modifying their behaviour and/or energy use in a compensatory manner. Under normal locomotion, elephant seals had low energy requirements (106.5±28.2 kJ kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), approaching or even falling below predictions of basal requirements. Seals responded to a small increase in locomotion costs by spending more time resting between dives (149±44 s) compared with matched control treatments (102±11 s; <i>P</i><0.01). Despite incurred costs, most other dive and transit behaviours were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across treatments, including fixed, rhythmic swimming gaits. Because of this, and because each flipper stroke had a predictable effect on total costs (<i>P</i><0.001), total energy expenditure was strongly correlated with time spent at sea under both treatments (<i>P</i><0.0001). These results suggest that transiting elephant seals have a limited capacity to modify their locomotory behaviour without increasing their transport costs. Based on this, we conclude that elephant seals and other ocean predators occupying similar niches may be particularly sensitive to increased transport costs incurred when avoiding unanticipated disturbances.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Photochemistry beyond the red limit in chlorophyll f–containing photosystems
<p>Photosystems I and II convert solar energy into the chemical energy that powers life. Chlorophyll a photochemistry, using red light (680 to 700 nm), is near universal and is considered to define the energy “red limit” of oxygenic photosynthesis. We present biophysical studies on the photosystems from a cyanobacterium grown in far-red light (750 nm). The few long-wavelength chlorophylls present are well resolved from each other and from the majority pigment, chlorophyll a. Charge separation in photosystem I and II uses chlorophyll f at 745 nm and chlorophyll f (or d) at 727 nm, respectively. Each photosystem has a few even longer-wavelength chlorophylls f that collect light and pass excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active pigments. These photosystems function beyond the red limit using far-red pigments in only a few key positions.</p>

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling geophysical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby fluid lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like fluid, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting fluids, quantum fluids, and plasmas.</p>

Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes
<p>Obesity occurs when whole-body energy intake exceeds energy expenditure for prolonged periods. This is a major public health issue because obesity increases the risk of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The liver and muscle store excess energy in the form of fat, leading to resistance to the hormone insulin. Released when blood glucose rises after meals, insulin normally promotes glucose uptake by muscle and represses glucose production by the liver, thus rapidly returning blood glucose to normal. However, this process is impaired in insulin-resistant individuals, who may eventually develop persistently elevated blood glucose (i.e., T2DM), which can cause debilitating or life-threatening complications. Because the energy sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes muscle glucose uptake by insulin-independent mechanisms, it was proposed in 1999 that AMPK-activating drugs might represent a novel approach to treating T2DM (<i>1</i>). Representing the culmination of more than 15 years of developing this concept, a study by Myers <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 507 of this issue and a study by Cokorinos <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that compounds that bind to a unique site on AMPK can promote glucose uptake by muscle, and hence reverse elevated blood glucose in animal models of T2DM.</p>

High-performance light-emitting diodes based on carbene-metal-amides
<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) promise highly efficient lighting and display technologies. We introduce a new class of linear donor-bridge-acceptor light-emitting molecules, which enable solution-processed OLEDs with near-100% internal quantum efficiency at high brightness. Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low exchange energy, substantial oscillator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point.</p>

STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) Interacts with Protein Kinase SnRK1
<p>Sucrose nonfermenting related kinase1 (SnRK1) is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed energy sensor kinase that regulates cellular adaptation to energy deficit in plants. Activation of SnRK1 leads to the down-regulation of ATP-consuming biosynthetic processes and the stimulation of energy-generating catabolic reactions by transcriptional reprogramming and posttranslational modifications. Although considerable progress has been made during the last years in understanding the SnRK1 signaling pathway, many of its components remain unidentified. Here, we show that the catalytic α-subunits KIN10 and KIN11 of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) SnRK1 complex interact with the STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) inside the plant cell nucleus. Overexpression of STKR1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants led to reduced growth, a delay in flowering, and strongly attenuated senescence. Metabolite profiling revealed that the transgenic lines exhausted their carbohydrates during the dark period to a greater extent than the wild type and accumulated a range of amino acids. At the global transcriptome level, genes affected by STKR1 overexpression were broadly associated with systemic acquired resistance, and transgenic plants showed enhanced resistance toward a virulent strain of the biotrophic oomycete pathogen <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> Noco2. We discuss a possible connection of STKR1 function, SnRK1 signaling, and plant immunity.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Loss and Gain of Human Acidic Mammalian Chitinase Activity by Nonsynonymous SNPs
<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is implicated in asthma, allergic inflammation, and food processing. Little is known about genetic and evolutional regulation of chitinolytic activity of AMCase. Here, we relate human AMCase polymorphisms to the mouse AMCase, and show that the highly active variants encoded by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are consistent with the mouse AMCase sequence. The chitinolytic activity of the recombinant human AMCase was significantly lower than that of the mouse counterpart. By creating mouse-human chimeric AMCase protein we found that the presence of the N-terminal region of human AMCase containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed active site residues reduced the enzymatic activity of the molecule. We were able to significantly increase the activity of human AMCase by amino acid substitutions encoded by nsSNPs (N45, D47, and R61) with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the mouse homologue (D45, N47, and M61). For abolition of the mouse AMCase activity, introduction of M61R mutation was sufficient. M61 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in most of primates other than human and orangutan as well as in other mammals. Orangutan has I61 substitution, which also markedly reduced the activity of the mouse AMCase, indicating that the M61 is a crucial residue for the chitinolytic activity. Altogether, our data suggest that human AMCase has lost its chitinolytic activity by integration of nsSNPs during evolution and that the enzyme can be reactivated by introducing amino acids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the mouse counterpart.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Complement Receptor C5aR1 Plays an Evolutionarily Conserved Role in Successful Cardiac Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Defining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed molecular pathways in animal models of successful cardiac regeneration could yield insight into why adult mammals have inadequate cardiac regeneration after injury.

Apical resection to remove ≈10% to 20% of ventricular mass was carried out in these model organisms.

This approach revealed induction of gene expression for complement 5a receptor 1 in the regenerating hearts of zebrafish, axolotls, and mice.

Structural basis for blue-green light harvesting and energy dissipation in diatoms
<p>Diatoms are abundant photosynthetic organisms in aquatic environments and contribute 40% of its primary productivity. An important factor that contributes to the success of diatoms is their fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs), which have exceptional light-harvesting and photoprotection capabilities. Here, we report the crystal structure of an FCP from the marine diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>, which reveals the binding of seven chlorophylls (Chls) a, two Chls c, seven fucoxanthins (Fxs), and probably one diadinoxanthin within the protein scaffold. Efficient energy transfer pathways can be found between Chl a and c, and each Fx is surrounded by Chls, enabling the energy transfer and quenching via Fx highly efficient. The structure provides a basis for elucidating the mechanisms of blue-green light harvesting, energy transfer, and dissipation in diatoms.</p>

Abundance of sensitive species (sharks, rays, and skates) decreased by 69% in heavily trawled areas.

Neutrino emission from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 prior to the IceCube-170922A alert
<p>A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.</p>

Heterogeneous to homogeneous melting transition visualized with ultrafast electron diffraction

We used electron diffraction at mega–electron volt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es to visualize the ultrafast melting of gold on the atomic scale length. For energy densities approaching the irreversible melting regime, we first observed heterogeneous melting on time scales of 100 to 1000 picoseconds, transitioning to homogeneous melting that occurs catastrophically within 10 to 20 picoseconds at higher energy densities. We showed evidence for the heterogeneous coexistence of solid and liquid. We determined the ion and electron temperature evolution and found superheated conditions. Our results constrain the electron-ion coupling rate, determine the Debye temperature, and reveal the melting sensitivity to nucleation seeds.</p>

Structure of the maize photosystem I supercomplex with light-harvesting complexes I and II
<p>Plants regulate photosynthetic light harvesting to maintain balanced energy flux into photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII). Under light conditions favoring PSII excitation, the PSII antenna, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), is phosphorylated and forms a supercomplex with PSI core and the PSI antenna, light-harvesting complex I (LHCI). Both LHCI and LHCII then transfer excitation energy to the PSI core. We report the structure of maize PSI-LHCI-LHCII solved by cryo–electron microscopy, revealing the recognition site between LHCII and PSI. The PSI subunits PsaN and PsaO are observed at the PSI-LHCI interface and the PSI-LHCII interface, respectively. Each subunit relays excitation to PSI core through a pair of chlorophyll molecules, thus revealing previously unseen paths for energy transfer between the antennas and the PSI core.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise
<p>In modern microelectronic devices, hot electrons accelerate, scatter, and dissipate energy in nanoscale dimensions. Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-electron energy dissipation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the electrons. We realize electronic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or shot noise, associated with ultrafast hot-electron kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-electron distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide crystal lattice. With nanoconstriction devices, we reveal unexpected nonlocal energy dissipation at room temperature, which is reminiscent of ballistic transport of low-temperature quantum conductors.</p>

Fish reproductive-energy output increases disproportionately with body size
<p>Body size determines total reproductive-energy output. Most theories assume reproductive output is a fixed proportion of size, with respect to mass, but formal macroecological tests are lacking. Management based on that assumption risks underestimating the contribution of larger mothers to replenishment, hindering sustainable harvesting. We test this assumption in marine fishes with a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of the intraspecific mass scaling of reproductive-energy output. We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how reproduction scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting cause fish sizes to decline; our results provide quantitative estimates of how these declines affect fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Nanocrystalline copper films are never flat
<p>We used scanning tunneling microscopy to study low-angle grain boundaries at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films. The presence of grain boundaries and their emergence at the film surface create valleys composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that valleys and ridges were created by an out-of-plane grain rotation driven by reduction of grain boundary energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive radiative cooling draws heat from surfaces and radiates it into space as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of excited-state organometallic catalysis via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via energy transfer.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ing component of mitochondrial respiration. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respiration is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

The Transcriptional Coactivator ADA2b Recruits a Structural Maintenance Protein to Double-Strand Breaks during DNA Repair in Plants
<p>DNA damage occurs in all cells and can hinder chromosome stability and cell viability. Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes5/6 (SMC5/6) is a protein complex that functions as an evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed chromosomal ATPase critical for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanisms regulating this complex in plants are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcriptional coactivator ALTERATION/DEFICIENCY IN ACTIVATION2B (ADA2b) as an interactor of SMC5 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ADA2b is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex, which functions in transcriptional regulation. Characterization of mutant and knockdown Arabidopsis lines showed that disruption of either <i>SMC5</i> or <i>ADA2b</i> resulted in enhanced DNA damage. Both SMC5 and ADA2b were associated with γ-H2AX, a marker of DSBs, and the recruitment of SMC5 onto DSBs was dependent on ADA2b. In addition, overexpression of <i>SMC5</i> in the <i>ada2b</i> mutant background stimulated cell death. Collectively, our results show that the interaction between ADA2b and SMC5 mediates DNA repair in plant cells, suggesting a functional association between these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed proteins and further elucidating mechanisms of DNA damage repair in plants.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant growth to changing conditions. Under drought, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ing energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse growth conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate drought in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the growth of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate drought, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to drought stress but do show less growth inhibition of young leaves under drought. Surprisingly, the growth-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical drought hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, damage due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess illumination, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal biological relevance of the regulation of electron transport reactions within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where damage is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive damage targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that <i>OsMADS1</i>, <i>OsMADS5</i>, and <i>OsMADS34</i> together regulate floral meristem determinacy and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes.

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

A Conserved cis-Regulatory Module Determines Germline Fate through Activation of the Transcription Factor DUO1 Promoter
<p>The development of the male germline within pollen relies upon the activation of numerous target genes by the transcription factor DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). The expression of DUO1 is restricted to the male germline and is first detected shortly after the asymmetric division that segregates the germ cell lineage. Transcriptional regulation is critical in controlling DUO1 expression, since transcriptional and translational fusions show similar expression patterns. Here, we identify key promoter sequences required for the germline-specific regulation of <i>DUO1</i> transcription. Combining promoter deletion analyses with phylogenetic footprinting in eudicots and in Arabidopsis accessions, we identify a cis-regulatory module, <i>Regulatory region of DUO1</i> (<i>ROD1</i>), which replicates the expression pattern of <i>DUO1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We show that <i>ROD1</i> from the legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i> directs male germline-specific expression in Arabidopsis, demonstrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of DUO1 regulation among eudicots. <i>ROD1</i> contains several short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-regulatory elements, including three copies of the motif DNGTGGV, required for germline expression and tandem repeats of the motif YAACYGY, which enhance <i>DUO1</i> transcription in a positive feedback loop. We conclude that a cis-regulatory module <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in eudicots directs the spatial and temporal expression of the transcription factor DUO1 to specify male germline fate and sperm cell differentiation.</p>

Dissecting the Metabolic Role of Mitochondria during Developmental Leaf Senescence
<p>The functions of mitochondria during leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death aimed at the massive retrieval of nutrients from the senescing organ to the rest of the plant, remain elusive. Here, combining experimental and analytical approaches, we showed that mitochondrial integrity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed until the latest stages of leaf senescence, while their number drops by 30%. Adenylate phosphorylation state assays and mitochondrial respiratory measurements indicated that the leaf energy status also is maintained during this time period. Furthermore, after establishing a curated list of genes coding for products targeted to mitochondria, we analyzed in isolation their transcript profiles, focusing on several key mitochondrial functions, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transfer chain, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, transporters, as well as catabolic pathways. In tandem with a metabolomic approach, our data indicated that mitochondrial metabolism was reorganized to support the selective catabolism of both amino acids and fatty acids. Such adjustments would ensure the replenishment of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate, which provide the carbon backbones for nitrogen remobilization. Glutamate, being the substrate of the strongly up-regulated cytosolic glutamine synthase, is likely to become a metabolically limiting factor in the latest stages of developmental leaf senescence. Finally, an evolutionary age analysis revealed that, while branched-chain amino acid and proline catabolism are very old mitochondrial functions particularly enriched at the latest stages of leaf senescence, auxin metabolism appears to be rather newly acquired. In summation, our work shows that, during developmental leaf senescence, mitochondria orchestrate catabolic processes by becoming increasingly central energy and metabolic hubs.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

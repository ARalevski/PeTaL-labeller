Synthesis of partially and fully fused polyaromatics by annulative chlorophenylene dimerization
<p>Since the discovery by Ullmann and Bielecki in 1901, reductive dimerization (or homocoupling) of aryl halides has been extensively exploited for the generation of a range of biaryl-based functional molecules. In contrast to the single-point connection in these products, edge-sharing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d aromatic systems have not generally been accessible from simple aryl halides via annulation cascades. Here we report a single-step synthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d aromatics with a triphenylene core by the palladium-catalyzed annulative dimerization of structurally and functionally diverse chlorophenylenes through double carbon-hydrogen bond activation. The partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d polyaromatics can be transformed into fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d, small graphene nanoribbons, which are otherwise difficult to synthesize. This simple, yet powerful, method allows access to functional π-systems of interest in optoelectronics research.</p>

The ATG conjugation systems are important for degradation of the inner autophagosomal membrane
<p>In macroautophagy, cytoplasmic contents are sequestered into the double-membrane autophagosome, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>s with the lysosome to become the autolysosome. It has been thought that the autophagy-related (ATG) conjugation systems are required for autophagosome formation. Here, we found that autophagosomal soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) syntaxin 17–positive autophagosome-like structures could be generated even in the absence of the ATG conjugation systems, although at a reduced rate. These syntaxin 17–positive structures could further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong> with lysosomes, but degradation of the inner autophagosomal membrane was significantly delayed. Accordingly, autophagic activity in ATG conjugation–deficient cells was strongly suppressed. We suggest that the ATG conjugation systems, which are likely required for the closure (i.e., fission) of the autophagosomal edge, are not absolutely essential for autolysosome formation but are important for efficient degradation of the inner autophagosomal membrane.</p>

Actin-Propelled Invasive Membrane Protrusions Promote Fusogenic Protein Engagement During Cell-Cell Fusion

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong> to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>s, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>s that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulates eyelid closure in the developing rat by stimulating EGFR signaling
<p>In many mammals, the eyelids migrate over the eye and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong> during embryogenesis to protect the cornea from damage during birth and early life. Loss-of-function mutations affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway cause an eyes-open-at-birth (EOB) phenotype in rodents. We identified an insertional mutation in <i>Spinster homolog 2</i> (<i>Spns2</i>) in a strain of transgenic rats exhibiting the EOB phenotype. Spns2, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) transporter that releases S1P from cells, was enriched at the tip of developing eyelids in wild-type rat embryos. <i>Spns2</i> expression or treatment with S1P or any one of several EGFR ligands rescued the EOB <i>Spns2</i> mutant phenotype in vivo and in tissue explants in vitro and rescued the formation of stress fibers in primary keratinocytes from mutants. S1P signaled through the receptors S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 to activate extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and EGFR-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1)–c-Jun signaling. S1P also induced the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor MAL in a manner dependent on EGFR signaling. MAL and c-Jun stimulated the expression of the microRNAs <i>miR-21</i> and <i>miR-222</i>, both of which target the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP3, thus promoting metalloprotease activity. The metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 stimulated EGFR signaling by cleaving a membrane-anchored form of EGF to release the ligand. Our results outline a network by which S1P transactivates EGFR signaling through a complex mechanism involving feedback between several intra- and extracellular molecules to promote eyelid fusion in the developing rat.</p>

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical synapses in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong> with the plasma membrane to release neurotransmitters that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated release of their afferent neurotransmitter, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal release of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

mTORC1 controls lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the two-pore channel TPC2
<p>Two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2) is a ubiquitously expressed, lysosomally targeted ion channel that aids in terminating autophagy and is inhibited upon its association with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is controversial whether TPC2 mediates lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or selectively conducts Na<sup>+</sup> and whether the binding of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is required for the activity of this ion channel. We show that TPC2 is required for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in response to NAADP or to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. In pulmonary arterial myocytes, rapamycin and NAADP evoked global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were blocked by depletion of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Preincubation of cells with high concentrations of rapamycin resulted in desensitization and blocked NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Moreover, rapamycin and NAADP did not evoke discernable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in myocytes derived from <i>Tpcn2</i> knockout mice, which showed normal responses to other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing signals. In HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human TPC2, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mTOR blocked rapamycin- and NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Confocal imaging of a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to TPC2 demonstrated that rapamycin-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals localized to lysosomes and were in close proximity to TPC2. Therefore, inactivation of mTOR may activate TPC2 and consequently lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>

The molecular structure of the nanometer-sized cylinder with periodic vacancy defects was confirmed spectroscopically and crystallographically. The nanoporous nature of the compound further enabled inclusion of multiple fullerene guests. Computations suggest that fusing many such cylinders could produce carbon nanotubes with electronic properties modulated by the periodic vacancy defects.</p>

Catalytic palladium-oxyallyl cycloaddition
<p>Exploration of intermediates that enable chemoselective cycloaddition reactions and expeditious construction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d- or bridged-ring systems is a continuous challenge for organic synthesis. As an intermediate of interest, the oxyallyl cation has been harnessed to synthesize architectures containing seven-membered rings via (4+3) cycloaddition. However, its potential to access five-membered skeletons is underdeveloped, largely due to the thermally forbidden (3+2) pathway. Here, the combination of a tailored precursor and a Pd(0) catalyst generates a Pd-oxyallyl intermediate that cyclizes with conjugated dienes to produce a diverse array of tetrahydrofuran skeletons. The cycloaddition overrides conventional (4+3) selectivity by proceeding through a stepwise pathway involving a Pd-allyl transfer and ring closure sequence. Subsequent treatment of the (3+2) adducts with a palladium catalyst converts the heterocycles to the carbocyclic cyclopentanones.</p>

High-resolution cryo-EM analysis of the yeast ATP synthase in a lipid membrane

To limit conformational heterogeneity, we locked the rotor in a single conformation by fusing the F6 subunit of the stator with the δ subunit of the rotor. Assembly of the enzyme with the F6-δ fusion caused a twisting of the rotor and a 9° rotation of the F<sub>o</sub> c<sub>10</sub>-ring in the direction of ATP synthesis, relative to the structure of isolated F<sub>o</sub>.

Methanogenic heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC-MvhAGD) uses two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters for reduction

Coenzymes are consecutively released upon one-by-one electron transfer.

An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova

We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.</p>

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

GS<sup>yellow</sup>, a Multifaceted Tag for Functional Protein Analysis in Monocot and Dicot Plants
<p>The ability to tag proteins has boosted the emergence of generic molecular methods for protein functional analysis. Fluorescent protein tags are used to visualize protein localization, and affinity tags enable the mapping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem affinity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multifunctional tandem affinity purification tag, named GS<sup>yellow</sup>, which combines the streptavidin-binding peptide tag with citrine yellow fluorescent protein. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a set of benchmark proteins. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction profile of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag, along the growth zone of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf.

Comparison with AN3 target genes mapped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of protein functional analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves transforming a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.</p>

A Rice Glutamyl-tRNA Synthetase Modulates Early Anther Cell Division and Patterning
<p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have housekeeping roles in protein synthesis, but little is known about how these aaRSs are involved in organ development. Here, we report that a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (OsERS1) maintains proper somatic cell organization and limits the overproliferation of male germ cells during early anther development. The expression of <i>OsERS1</i> is specifically detectable in meristematic layer 2-derived cells of the early anther, and <i>osers1</i> anthers exhibit overproliferation and disorganization of layer 2-derived cells, producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d lobes and extra germ cells in early anthers. The conserved biochemical function of OsERS1 in ligating glutamate to tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> is enhanced by its cofactor aaRS OsARC. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling revealed that OsERS1 is an important node for multiple metabolic pathways, indicated by the accumulation of amino acids and tricarboxylic acid cycle components in <i>osers1</i> anthers. Notably, the anther defects of the <i>osers1</i> mutant are causally associated with the abnormal accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, which can reconstitute the <i>osers1</i> phenotype when applied to wild-type anthers. Collectively, these findings demonstrate how aaRSs affect male organ development in plants, likely through protein synthesis, metabolic homeostasis, and redox status.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified system allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

However, how <i>AGL6</i> genes control flower development remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that OsMADS6 directly targets <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1</i> (<i>OsFDML1</i>), a rice homolog of the <i>SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3</i>-like gene <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION 1</i> (<i>FDM1</i>) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).

Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts.

Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome instability.</p>

Subcellular Compartmentation of Alternatively Spliced Transcripts Defines <i>SERINE/ARGININE-RICH PROTEIN30</i> Expression<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Alternative splicing (AS) is prevalent in higher eukaryotes, and generation of different AS variants is tightly regulated. Widespread AS occurs in response to altered light conditions and plays a critical role in seedling photomorphogenesis, but despite its frequency and effect on plant development, the functional role of AS remains unknown for most splicing variants. Here, we characterized the light-dependent AS variants of the gene encoding the splicing regulator Ser/Arg-rich protein SR30 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We demonstrated that the splicing variant <i>SR30.2</i>, which is predominantly produced in darkness, is enriched within the nucleus and strongly depleted from ribosomes. Light-induced AS from a downstream 3′ splice site gives rise to <i>SR30.1</i>, which is exported to the cytosol and translated, coinciding with SR30 protein accumulation upon seedling illumination. Constitutive expression of SR30.1 and SR30.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to fluorescent proteins revealed their identical subcellular localization in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles. Furthermore, expression of either variant shifted splicing of a genomic <i>SR30</i> reporter toward <i>SR30.2</i>, suggesting that an autoregulatory feedback loop affects <i>SR30</i> splicing. We provide evidence that <i>SR30.2</i> can be further spliced and, unlike <i>SR30.2</i>, the resulting cassette exon variant <i>SR30.3</i> is sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay. Our work delivers insight into the complex and compartmentalized RNA processing mechanisms that control the expression of the splicing regulator SR30 in a light-dependent manner.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During pollen tube growth, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. Pollen tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four pollen-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised pollen germination and pollen tube growth. GFP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to pollen tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of pollen tube cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of pollen tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of pollen tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain pollen tube cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the proton-motive force, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this proton-motive force not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transition zone located between the meristem and elongation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the transition zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the transition zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

Division Plane Orientation Defects Revealed by a Synthetic Double Mutant Phenotype
<p>TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOTS9 (AIR9) are microtubule-binding proteins that localize to the division site in plants. Their function in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) remained unclear because neither <i>tan1</i> nor <i>air9</i> single mutants have a strong phenotype. We show that <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have a synthetic phenotype consisting of short, twisted roots with disordered cortical microtubule arrays that are hypersensitive to a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. The <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have significant defects in division plane orientation due to failures in placing the new cell wall at the correct division site. Full-length TAN1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to yellow fluorescent protein, <i>TAN1-YFP</i>, and several deletion constructs were transformed into the double mutant to assess which regions of TAN1 are required for its function in root growth, root twisting, and division plane orientation. <i>TAN1-YFP</i> expressed in <i>tan1 air9</i> significantly rescued the double mutant phenotype in all three respects. Interestingly, TAN1 missing the first 126 amino acids, TAN1-ΔI-YFP, failed to rescue the double mutant phenotype, while TAN1 missing a conserved middle region, TAN1-ΔII-YFP, significantly rescued the mutant phenotype in terms of root growth and division plane orientation but not root twisting. We use the <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutant to discover new functions for TAN1 and AIR9 during phragmoplast guidance and root morphogenesis.</p>

Distinct Functions of STARCH SYNTHASE 4 Domains in Starch Granule Formation
<p>The formation of normal starch granules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf chloroplasts requires STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4). In plants lacking SS4, chloroplasts typically produce only one round granule rather than multiple lenticular granules. The mechanisms by which SS4 determines granule number and morphology are not understood. The N-terminal region of SS4 is unique among SS isoforms and contains several long coiled-coil motifs, typically implicated in protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal region contains the catalytic glucosyltransferase domains, which are widely conserved in plant SS and bacterial glycogen synthase (GS) isoforms. We investigated the specific roles of the N- and C-terminal regions of SS4 by expressing truncated versions of SS4 and a fusion between the N-terminal region of SS4 and GS in the Arabidopsis <i>ss4</i> mutant. Expression of the N-terminal region of SS4 alone did not alter the <i>ss4</i> mutant phenotype. Expression of the C-terminal region of SS4 alone increased granule initiation but did not rescue their aberrant round morphology. Expression of a self-priming GS from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> also increased the number of round granules. Remarkably, fusion of the N-terminal region of SS4 to <i>A. tumefaciens</i> GS restored the development of wild-type-like lenticular starch granules. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of SS4 alone or when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to GS conferred a patchy subchloroplastic localization similar to that of the full-length SS4 protein. Considered together, these data suggest that, while the glucosyltransferase activity of SS4 is important for granule initiation, the N-terminal part of SS4 serves to establish the correct granule morphology by properly localizing this activity.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, viruses encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to support the intercellular movement of viruses is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle movement assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-terminal half of P3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open reading frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV), in the intercellular movement of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to support the PD targeting and intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in transmission electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a docking point for PD targeting and the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular movement of viral replication vesicles.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The genetic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin biosynthesis is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several biosynthesis families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin biosynthesis pathway leads to large, often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin biosynthesis in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

NTL8 Regulates Trichome Formation in Arabidopsis by Directly Activating R3 MYB Genes <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>
<p>The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) are plant-specific transcription factors that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development and plant response to environmental stimuli. We report here the identification of NTM1-LIKE8 (NTL8), a membrane-associated NAC transcription factor, as a novel regulator of trichome formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). From an activation-tagged Arabidopsis population, we identified a dominant, gain-of-function mutant with glabrous inflorescence stem. By using plasmid rescue and RT-PCR analyses, we found that <i>NTL8</i> was tagged; thus, the mutant was named <i>ntl8-1 Dominant</i> (<i>ntl8-1D</i>). Recapitulation experiment further confirmed that the phenotype observed in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant was caused by elevated expression of <i>NTL8</i>. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of the single-repeat R3 MYB genes <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> (<i>TRY</i>) and <i>TRICHOMELESS1</i> (<i>TCL1</i>) was elevated in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant. Genetic analyses demonstrated that NTL8 acts upstream of TRY and TCL1 in the regulation of trichome formation. When recruited to the promoter region of the reporter gene <i>Gal4:GUS</i> by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d GAL4 DNA-binding domain, NTL8 activated the expression of the reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i> are direct targets of NTL8. However, NTL8 did not interact with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE9, another transcription factor that regulates the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>, in yeast and plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NTL8 negatively regulates trichome formation in Arabidopsis by directly activating the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>.</p>

Mechanism of Dual Targeting of the Phytochrome Signaling Component HEMERA/pTAC12 to Plastids and the Nucleus
<p>HEMERA (HMR) is a nuclear and plastidial dual-targeted protein. While it functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator in phytochrome signaling to regulate a distinct set of light-responsive, growth-relevant genes, in plastids it is known as pTAC12, which associates with the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase, and is essential for inducing the plastomic photosynthetic genes and initiating chloroplast biogenesis. However, the mechanism of targeting HMR to the nucleus and plastids is still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMR can be directly imported into chloroplasts through a transit peptide residing in the N-terminal 50 amino acids. Upon cleavage of the transit peptide and additional proteolytic processing, mature HMR, which begins from Lys-58, retains its biochemical properties in phytochrome signaling. Unexpectedly, expression of mature HMR failed to rescue not only the plastidial but also the nuclear defects of the <i>hmr</i> mutant. This is because the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR are nonfunctional, and therefore mature HMR is unable to accumulate in either plastids or the nucleus. Surprisingly, fusing the transit peptide of the small subunit of Rubisco with mature HMR rescues both its plastidial and nuclear localization and functions. These results, combined with the observation that the nuclear form of HMR has the same reduced molecular mass as plastidial HMR, support a retrograde protein translocation mechanism in which HMR is targeted first to plastids, processed to the mature form, and then relocated to the nucleus.</p>

Antiviral Resistance Protein Tm-2<sup>2</sup> Functions on the Plasma Membrane
<p>The tomato <i>Tobacco mosaic virus resistance-2<sup>2</sup></i> (<i>Tm-2<sup>2</sup></i>) gene encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide binding site-Leu-rich repeat protein lacking a conventional plasma membrane (PM) localization motif. Tm-2<sup>2</sup> confers plant extreme resistance against tobamoviruses including <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) by recognizing the avirulence (Avr) viral movement protein (MP). However, the subcellular compartment where Tm-2<sup>2</sup> functions is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Tm-2<sup>2</sup> interacts with TMV MP to form a protein complex at the PM. We show that both inactive and active Tm-2<sup>2</sup> proteins are localized to the PM. When restricted to PM by fusing Tm-2<sup>2</sup> to the <i>S</i>-acylated PM association motif, the Tm-2<sup>2</sup> fusion protein can still induce a hypersensitive response cell death, consistent with its activation at the PM. Through analyses of viral MP mutants, we find that the plasmodesmata (PD) localization of the Avr protein MP is not required for Tm-2<sup>2</sup> function. These results suggest that Tm-2<sup>2</sup>-mediated resistance takes place on PM without requirement of its Avr protein to be located to PD.</p>

A DII Domain-Based Auxin Reporter Uncovers Low Auxin Signaling during Telophase and Early G1
<p>A sensitive and dynamically responsive auxin signaling reporter based on the DII domain of the INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID28 (IAA28, DII) protein from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was modified for use in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The DII domain was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d to a yellow fluorescent protein and a nuclear localization sequence to simplify quantitative nuclear fluorescence signal. DII degradation dynamics provide an estimate of input signal into the auxin signaling pathway that is influenced by both auxin accumulation and F-box coreceptor concentration. In maize, the DII-based marker responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner to exogenous auxin via proteasome-mediated degradation. Low levels of DII-specific fluorescence corresponding to high endogenous auxin signaling occurred near vasculature tissue and the outer layer and glume primordia of spikelet pair meristems and floral meristems, respectively. In addition, high DII levels were observed in cells during telophase and early G1, suggesting that low auxin signaling at these stages may be important for cell cycle progression.</p>

Two Membrane-Anchored Aspartic Proteases Contribute to Pollen and Ovule Development
<p>Aspartic proteases are a class of proteolytic enzymes with conserved aspartate residues, which are implicated in protein processing, maturation, and degradation. Compared with yeast and animals, plants possess a larger aspartic protease family. However, little is known about most of these enzymes. Here, we characterized two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartic protease genes, <i>A36</i> and <i>A39</i>, which are highly expressed in pollen and pollen tubes. <i>a36</i> and <i>a36 a39</i> mutants display significantly reduced pollen activity. Transmission electron microscopy and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assays further revealed that the unviable pollen in <i>a36 a39</i> may undergo unanticipated apoptosis-like programmed cell death. The degeneration of female gametes also occurred in <i>a36 a39</i>. Aniline Blue staining, scanning electron microscopy, and semi in vitro guidance assays indicated that the micropylar guidance of pollen tubes is significantly compromised in <i>a36 a39</i>. A36 and A39 that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d with green fluorescent protein are localized to the plasma membrane and display punctate cytosolic localization and colocalize with the GPI-anchored protein COBRA-LIKE10. Furthermore, in <i>a36 a39</i>, the abundance of highly methylesterified homogalacturonans and xyloglucans was increased significantly in the apical pollen tube wall. These results indicate that A36 and A39, two putative GPI-anchored aspartic proteases, play important roles in plant reproduction in Arabidopsis.</p>

Both mutants demonstrated strongly impaired NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses of the wild type and a mutant containing CpcG2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>d with yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6 indicated the presence of a novel NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex, which was absent in the <i>cpcG2</i> deletion mutant, the PSI-less mutant, and several other strains deficient in NDH-1L and/or NDH-1M. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses on CpcG2-yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6, using antibody against green fluorescent protein and nickel column chromatography, confirmed the association of CpcG2 with the supercomplex. Conversely, the use of antibodies against NdhH or NdhK after blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments verified the necessity of CpcG2 in stabilizing the supercomplex. Furthermore, deletion of CpcG2 destabilized NDH-1L as well as its degradation product NDH-1M and significantly decreased the number of functional PSI centers, consistent with the involvement of CpcG2 in NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. The CpcG2 deletion, however, had no effect on respiration. Thus, we propose that the formation of an NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex in cyanobacteria facilitates PSI cyclic electron transport via NDH-1L.</p>

From shape to cells: mouse models reveal mechanisms altering palate development in Apert syndrome
<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by severe skull malformations and caused by one of two missense mutations, S252W and P253R, on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The molecular bases underlying differential Apert syndrome phenotypes are still poorly understood and it is unclear why cleft palate is more frequent in patients carrying the S252W mutation. Taking advantage of Apert syndrome mouse models, we performed a novel combination of morphometric, histological and immunohistochemical analyses to precisely quantify distinct palatal phenotypes in <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> and <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></i> mice. We localized regions of differentially altered FGF signaling and assessed local cell patterns to establish a baseline for understanding the differential effects of these two <i>Fgfr2</i> mutations. Palatal suture scoring and comparative 3D shape analysis from high resolution μCT images of 120 newborn mouse skulls showed that <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> mice display relatively more severe palate dysmorphologies, with contracted and more separated palatal shelves, a greater tendency to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong> the maxillary-palatine sutures and aberrant development of the inter-premaxillary suture. These palatal defects are associated with suture-specific patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The posterior region of the developing palate emerges as a potential target for therapeutic strategies in clinical management of cleft palate in Apert syndrome patients.</p>

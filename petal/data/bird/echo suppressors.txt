Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of fitness, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Acetylation-dependent regulation of MDM2 E3 ligase activity dictates its oncogenic function
<p>Abnormal activation of the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is frequently observed in human cancers. By ubiquitinating the tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> p53 protein, which leads to its proteasome-mediated destruction, MDM2 limits the tumor-suppressing activity of p53. On the other hand, by ubiquitinating itself, MDM2 targets itself for destruction and promotes the p53 tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> pathway, a process that can be antagonized by the deubiquitinase herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP). We investigated the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity and found that acetyltransferase p300–mediated acetylation and stabilization of MDM2 are molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es that block self-ubiquitination, thereby shifting its E3 ligase activity toward p53. In vitro and in cancer cell lines, p300-mediated acetylation of MDM2 on Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup> enabled HAUSP to bind, presumably deubiquitinate, and stabilize MDM2. This acetylation within the nuclear localization signal domain decreased its interaction with the acidic domain, subsequently increased the interaction between the acidic domain and RING domain in MDM2, enabled the binding of HAUSP to the acidic domain in MDM2, and shifted MDM2 activity from autoubiquitination to p53 ubiquitination. However, upon genotoxic stress through exposure to etoposide, the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylated MDM2 at Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup>, thereby promoting self-ubiquitination and less ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, thus increasing p53-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates that dynamic acetylation is a molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> in the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity, revealing further insight into the posttranslational regulation of the MDM2/p53 cell survival axis.</p>

Hierarchical reasoning by neural circuits in the frontal cortex
<p>Humans process information hierarchically. In the presence of hierarchies, sources of failures are ambiguous. Humans resolve this ambiguity by assessing their confidence after one or more attempts. To understand the neural basis of this reasoning strategy, we recorded from dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of monkeys in a task in which negative outcomes were caused either by misjudging the stimulus or by a covert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> between two stimulus-response contingency rules. We found that both areas harbored a representation of evidence supporting a rule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>. Additional perturbation experiments revealed that ACC functioned downstream of DMFC and was directly and specifically involved in inferring covert rule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es. These results reveal the computational principles of hierarchical reasoning, as implemented by cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Cellular checkpoint control using programmable sequential logic

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory

We demonstrate a single-photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the device resets.

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing concentrations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP concentrations to exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>ous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP concentrations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP concentration–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP concentrations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP concentration. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil migration.</p>

Restoring tumor suppression

Much attention has focused on therapeutically inhibiting oncogenic kinases that are activated by mutation. However, there has been less focus on targeting phosphatases, despite their importance in cancer development. The tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is the most frequently inactivated phosphatase in human cancer (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The loss of PTEN phosphatase activity increases downstream activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling pathway (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Preclinical studies have shown that targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway reduces tumor growth when PTEN is inactivated (<i>5</i>). However, many PTEN mutant tumors are resistant to such therapies. On page 651 of this issue, Lee <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) activate PTEN phosphatase by inhibiting a newly described inhibitory system and thereby reduce PI3K-AKT signaling and tumor growth in mice.</p>

Asymmetric distribution and spatial switching of dynein activity generates ciliary motility
<p>Motile cilia and flagella are essential, highly conserved organelles, and their motility is driven by the coordinated activities of multiple dynein isoforms. The prevailing “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>-point” hypothesis posits that dyneins are asymmetrically activated to drive flagellar bending. To test this model, we applied cryo–electron tomography to visualize activity states of individual dyneins relative to their locations along beating flagella of sea urchin sperm cells. As predicted, bending was generated by the asymmetric distribution of dynein activity on opposite sides of the flagellum. However, contrary to predictions, most dyneins were in their active state, and the smaller population of conformationally inactive dyneins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ed flagellar sides relative to the bending direction. Thus, our data suggest a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>-inhibition” mechanism in which force imbalance is generated by inhibiting, rather than activating, dyneins on alternating sides of the flagellum.</p>

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing of gas permeation upon E-field polarization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices.

The stiffening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability.

Upon E-field polarization, we observed a defibrillation of the different lattice motions.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience.

This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved?

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>ry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>ry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape behavior in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments.

Assembling human brain organoids

In humans, this process takes place over a long fetal phase and continues into the postnatal period, but it is largely inaccessible for direct, functional investigation at a cellular level. Therefore, the features that make the human central nervous system unique and the sequence of molecular and cellular events underlying brain disorders remain largely uncharted. Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells, including those obtained by reprogramming somatic cells, have the ability to self-organize and differentiate when grown in three-dimensional (3D) aggregates rather than in direct contact with a flat plastic surface (<i>1</i>). Such 3D neural cultures, also known as organoids and organ spheroids, recapitulate many aspects of human brain development in vitro (<i>1</i>) and have the potential to accelerate progress in human neurobiology. Here, I discuss the emerging approaches to produce brain assembloids—the next generation of brain organoids that combine multiple cell lineages in 3D. These cultures can be used to model interactions between various brain regions in vitro, and ultimately may be applied to understand the assembly of neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s and to capture complex cell-cell interactions in the brain.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on superconductivity in a topologically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian topological states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es have involved only topologically trivial systems. Here we report reversible, in situ electrostatic on-off <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing of superconductivity in the recently established quantum spin Hall insulator monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>). Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer’s ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the topological insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin. Our results establish monolayer WTe<sub>2</sub> as a material platform for engineering nanodevices that combine superconducting and topological phases of matter.</p>

Allele-specific epigenome maps reveal sequence-dependent stochastic switching at regulatory loci
<p>To assess the impact of genetic variation in regulatory loci on human health, we constructed a high-resolution map of allelic imbalances in DNA methylation, histone marks, and gene transcription in 71 epigenomes from 36 distinct cell and tissue types from 13 donors. Deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 49 methylomes revealed sequence-dependent CpG methylation imbalances at thousands of heterozygous regulatory loci. Such loci are enriched for stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing, which is defined as random transitions between fully methylated and unmethylated states of DNA. The methylation imbalances at thousands of loci are explainable by different relative frequencies of the methylated and unmethylated states for the two alleles. Further analyses provided a unifying model that links sequence-dependent allelic imbalances of the epigenome, stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing at gene regulatory loci, and disease-associated genetic variation.</p>

High-performance perovskite/Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> monolithic tandem solar cells
<p>The combination of hybrid perovskite and Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) has the potential for realizing high-efficiency thin-film tandem solar cells because of the complementary tunable bandgaps and excellent photovoltaic properties of these materials. In tandem solar device architectures, the interconnecting layer plays a critical role in determining the overall cell performance, requiring both an effective electrical connection and high optical transparency. We used nanoscale interface engineering of the CIGS surface and a heavily doped poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) hole transport layer between the subcells that preserves open-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> voltage and enhances both the fill factor and short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> current.

An intrinsic S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint enforced by ATR
<p>The cell cycle is strictly ordered to ensure faithful genome duplication and chromosome segregation. Control mechanisms establish this order by dictating when a cell transitions from one phase to the next. Much is known about the control of the G<sub>1</sub>/S, G<sub>2</sub>/M, and metaphase/anaphase transitions, but thus far, no control mechanism has been identified for the S/G<sub>2</sub> transition. Here we show that cells transactivate the mitotic gene network as they exit the S phase through a CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1)–directed FOXM1 phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>. During normal DNA replication, the checkpoint kinase ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is activated by ETAA1 to block this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> until the S phase ends. ATR inhibition prematurely activates FOXM1, deregulating the S/G<sub>2</sub> transition and leading to early mitosis, underreplicated DNA, and DNA damage. Thus, ATR couples DNA replication with mitosis and preserves genome integrity by enforcing an S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint.</p>

A neural algorithm for a fundamental computing problem

The fly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> assigns similar neural activity patterns to similar odors, so that behaviors learned from one odor can be applied when a similar odor is experienced. The fly algorithm, however, uses three computational strategies that depart from traditional approaches.

This perspective helps illuminate the logic supporting an important sensory function and provides a conceptually new algorithm for solving a fundamental computational problem.</p>

A central neural circuit for itch sensation
<p>Although itch sensation is an important protective mechanism for animals, chronic itch remains a challenging clinical problem. Itch processing has been studied extensively at the spinal level. However, how itch information is transmitted to the brain and what central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s underlie the itch-induced scratching behavior remain largely unknown. We found that the spinoparabrachial pathway was activated during itch processing and that optogenetic suppression of this pathway impaired itch-induced scratching behaviors. Itch-mediating spinal neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, are disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via glutamatergic spinal projection neurons. Blockade of synaptic output of glutamatergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus suppressed pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. Thus, our studies reveal a central neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that is critical for itch signal processing.</p>

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing antiferromagnets with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded ferromagnetism of the magnetic layer at nanoscale thicknesses.

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells
<p>The formation of a dense and uniform thin layer on the substrates is crucial for the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing formamidinium with multiple cations and mixed halide anions. The concentration of defect states, which reduce a cell’s performance by decreasing the open-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> voltage and short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> current density, needs to be as low as possible.

A global brain state underlies <i>C. elegans</i> sleep behavior
<p>How the brain effectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es between and maintains global states, such as sleep and wakefulness, is not yet understood. We used brainwide functional imaging at single-cell resolution to show that during the developmental stage of lethargus, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> brain is predisposed to global quiescence, characterized by systemic down-regulation of neuronal activity. Only a few specific neurons are exempt from this effect. In the absence of external arousing cues, this quiescent brain state arises by the convergence of neuronal activities toward a fixed-point attractor embedded in an otherwise dynamic neural state space. We observed efficient spontaneous and sensory-evoked exits from quiescence. Our data support the hypothesis that during global states such as sleep, neuronal networks are drawn to a baseline mode and can be effectively reactivated by signaling from arousing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory

After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for fear memory, were maintained.

<i>SOX2</i> promotes lineage plasticity and antiandrogen resistance in <i>TP53</i>- and <i>RB1</i>-deficient prostate cancer
<p>Some cancers evade targeted therapies through a mechanism known as lineage plasticity, whereby tumor cells acquire phenotypic characteristics of a cell lineage whose survival no longer depends on the drug target. We use in vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer models to show that these tumors can develop resistance to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide by a phenotypic shift from androgen receptor (AR)–dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent basal-like cells. This lineage plasticity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor <i>SOX2</i>, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting <i>SOX2</i> expression. Thus, mutations in tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> genes can create a state of increased cellular plasticity that, when challenged with antiandrogen therapy, promotes resistance through lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom

This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Hypermorphic <i>SERK1</i> Mutations Function via a <i>SOBIR1</i> Pathway to Activate Floral Abscission Signaling
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the abscission of floral organs is regulated by two related receptor-like protein kinases, HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2). In complex with members of the SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) family of coreceptor protein kinases, HAE and HSL2 are activated when bound by INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSICSSION, a proteolytically processed peptide ligand, activating the expression of genes encoding secreted cell wall remodeling and hydrolase enzymes. <i>hae hsl2</i> mutants fail to induce expression of these genes and retain floral organs indefinitely. Here, we report identification of an allelic series of <i>hae hsl2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> mutations in the <i>SERK1</i> coreceptor protein kinase gene. Genetic and transcriptomic evidence indicates that these alleles represent a novel class of gain-of-function mutations that activate signaling independently of HAE/HSL2. We show that, surprisingly, the suppression effect does not rely on the protein kinase activity of SERK1 and that activation of signaling relies on the receptor-like kinase gene <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> OF BIR1</i> (<i>SOBIR1</i>). The effect of these mutations can be mimicked by loss of function of <i>BAK1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> (<i>BIR1</i>), a known negative regulator of <i>SERK</i>-<i>SOBIR1</i> signaling. These results suggest that <i>BIR1</i> negatively regulates <i>SERK-SOBIR1</i> signaling during abscission and that the identified <i>SERK1</i> mutations likely interfere with this negative regulation.</p>

This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate system with an improved signal-to-noise ratio.

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating <i>SHORTROOT</i> Transcription
<p><i>SHORTROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, but how its expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report that the Elongator complex, which consists of six subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of <i>SHR</i>. Depletion of Elongator drastically reduced <i>SHR</i> expression and led to defective root stem cell maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of Elongator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the <i>elp1</i> mutant to the transcription elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, support the notion that Elongator plays important roles in transcription elongation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of <i>SHR</i> and that mutation of Elongator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on the <i>SHR</i> gene body. Moreover, Elongator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4, a well-established transcription elongation factor that is recruited to the <i>SHR</i> locus. Together, these results demonstrate that Elongator acts in concert with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of <i>SHR</i>.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant viruses are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i>. Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a plastid-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two additional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal.

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA silencing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral silencing, viruses have evolved various RNA silencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA silencing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to interact specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA silencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this interaction. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In addition, ZmVDE could attenuate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein interaction-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient silencing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and coat protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE interacts with SCMV HC-Pro and attenuates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

Evolution of Digestive Enzymes and RNASE1 Provides Insights into Dietary Switch of Cetaceans
<p>Although cetaceans (whales, porpoises, and dolphins) have multi-chambered stomachs, feeding habits of modern cetaceans have dramatically changed from herbivorous to carnivorous. However, the genetic basis underlying this dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> remains unexplored. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of 10 digestive enzymes genes (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>CTRC</i>, <i>LIPC</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, <i>PNLIP</i>, <i>PGC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, <i>SI</i>, <i>SLC5A1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) of representative cetaceans, and the evolutionary trajectory of <i>RNASE1</i> in cetartiodactylans. Positive selections were detected with proteinases (i.e., <i>CTRC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) and lipases (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, and <i>PNLIP</i>) suggesting that cetaceans have evolved an enhanced digestion capacity for proteins and lipids, the major nutritional components of their prey (fishes and invertebrates). In addition, it was found that <i>RNASE1</i> gene duplicated after the cetartiodactylan speciation and two independent gene duplication events took place in Camelidae and Ruminantia. Positive selection was detected with <i>RNASE1</i> of Camelidae and Bovidae, suggesting enhanced digestive efficiency in the ruminants. Remarkably, even though the ancestors of cetaceans were terrestrial artiodactyls that are herbivorous, modern cetaceans lost the pancreatic <i>RNASE1</i> copy with digestive function, which is in accordance with the dietary change from herbivorous to carnivorous. In sum, this is the first study that provides new insights into the evolutionary mechanism of dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> in cetaceans.</p>

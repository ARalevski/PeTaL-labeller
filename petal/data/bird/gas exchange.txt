The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>eable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer surgeons an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   reported an increased rate of revision after primary THA using femoral   stems with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>eable neck. The aim of this study was to provide   a more comprehensive up-to-date analysis of primary THA using femoral   stems with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>eable and fixed necks.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The data included all primary THA procedures performed for osteoarthritis   (OA), reported to the AOANJRR between 01 September 1999 and 31 December   2014. There were 9289 femoral stems with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>eable neck and   253 165 femoral stems with a fixed neck. The characteristics of   the patients and prostheses including the bearing surface and stem/neck   metal combinations were examined using Cox proportional hazard ratios   (HRs) and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was found that prostheses with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>eable neck had a   higher rate of revision and this was evident regardless of the bearing   surface or the size of the femoral head. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>eable neck prostheses   with a titanium stem and a cobalt-chromium neck had a significantly   higher rate of revision compared with titanium stem/titanium neck   combinations (HR 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.23, p <   0.001). Revisions were higher for these combinations compared with   femoral stems with a fixed neck.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>There appears to be little evidence to support the continued   use of prostheses with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>eable neck in primary THA undertaken   for OA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:766–73.</p></sec>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e metabolites. Several combinations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

The bacterial Ras/Rap1 site-specific endopeptidase RRSP cleaves Ras through an atypical mechanism to disrupt Ras-ERK signaling
<p>The Ras–extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway is critical for controlling cell proliferation, and its aberrant activation drives the growth of various cancers. Because many pathogens produce toxins that inhibit Ras activity, efforts to develop effective Ras inhibitors to treat cancer could be informed by studies of Ras inhibition by pathogens. <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> causes fatal infections in a manner that depends on multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, a toxin that releases bacterial effector domains into host cells. One such domain is the Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP), which site-specifically cleaves the Switch I domain of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. We solved the crystal structure of RRSP and found that its backbone shares a structural fold with the EreA/ChaN-like superfamily of enzymes. Unlike other proteases in this family, RRSP is not a metalloprotease. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e assays, we determined that the processing of KRAS by RRSP did not release any fragments or cause KRAS to dissociate from its bound nucleotide but instead only locally affected its structure. However, this structural alteration of KRAS was sufficient to disable guanine nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e factor–mediated nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e and prevent KRAS from binding to RAF. Thus, RRSP is a bacterial effector that represents a previously unrecognized class of protease that disconnects Ras from its signaling network while inducing limited structural disturbance in its target.</p>

Structural basis for eIF2B inhibition in integrated stress response
<p>A core event in the integrated stress response, an adaptive pathway common to all eukaryotic cells in response to various stress stimuli, is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Normally, unphosphorylated eIF2 transfers the methionylated initiator tRNA to the ribosome in a guanosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent manner. By contrast, phosphorylated eIF2 inhibits its specific guanine nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e factor, eIF2B. To elucidate how the eIF2 phosphorylation status regulates the eIF2B activity, we determined cryo–electron microscopic and crystallographic structures of eIF2B in complex with unphosphorylated or phosphorylated eIF2. The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of eIF2 bind to eIF2B in completely different manners: the nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e-active and -inactive modes, respectively. These structures explain how phosphorylated eIF2 dominantly inhibits the nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e activity of eIF2B.</p>

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño
<p>The 2015–2016 El Niñño led to historically high temperatures and low precipitation over the tropics, while the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was the largest on record. Here we quantify the response of tropical net biosphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, gross primary production, biomass burning, and respiration to these climate anomalies by assimilating column CO<sub>2</sub>, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and carbon monoxide observations from multiple satellites. Relative to the 2011 La Niññña, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 ± 0.34 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere in 2015, consisting of approximately even contributions from three tropical continents but dominated by diverse carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e processes. The heterogeneity of the carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e processes indicated here challenges previous studies that suggested that a single dominant process determines carbon cycle interannual variability.</p>

High-performance light-emitting diodes based on carbene-metal-amides
<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) promise highly efficient lighting and display technologies. We introduce a new class of linear donor-bridge-acceptor light-emitting molecules, which enable solution-processed OLEDs with near-100% internal quantum efficiency at high brightness. Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e energy, substantial oscillator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e and hydraulic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e during dehydration.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Gas Exchange: The Balance between Carbon Fixation and Water Loss
<p>Stomatal control of transpiration is critical for maintaining important processes, such as plant water status, leaf temperature, as well as permitting sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into the leaf to maintain photosynthetic rates (<i>A</i>). Stomatal conductance often closely correlates with <i>A</i> and is thought to control the balance between water loss and carbon gain. It has been suggested that a mesophyll-driven signal coordinates <i>A</i> and stomatal conductance responses to maintain this relationship; however, the signal has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite this correlation under stable environmental conditions, the responses of both parameters vary spatially and temporally and are dependent on species, environment, and plant water status. Most current models neglect these aspects of gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, although it is clear that they play a vital role in the balance of carbon fixation and water loss. Future efforts should consider the dynamic nature of whole-plant gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e and how it represents much more than the sum of its individual leaf-level components, and they should take into consideration the long-term effect on gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e over time.</p>

Ecophysiological responses of <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Pinus uncinata</i> and <i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> in the Catalan Pyrenees to low summer rainfall
<p>Climate change is producing modifications in the intensity and frequency of rainfall in some regions of the planet. According to predictions, annual rainfall distribution in Western Europe will result in an increase in episodes of drought, thereby negatively affecting nutrient availability. Since high mountain systems will be particularly vulnerable, the physiological and nutritional responses to changes in summer rainfall were monitored over the course of two consecutive summers on three species, which are representative of subalpine forests: birch (<i>Betula pendula</i> Roth.), rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> L.) and mountain pine (<i>Pinus uncinata</i> Mill.). Birch was especially susceptible to scarce precipitation showing alterations in leaf morphology and a decline in net photosynthesis (<i>A</i>) due to stomatal closure, which led to photoinhibition and to early leaf senescence as shown by the photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE), carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, foliar N and <sup>13</sup>C isotope discrimination (Δ<sup>13</sup>C) results. The Δ<sup>13</sup>C of the soluble fraction is a good estimator of intrinsic water-use efficiency in this species. Rhododendron and mountain pine had sclerophyllous leaves, as indicated by leaf mass per area, Δ<sup>13</sup>C, PNUE and C/N results. Rhododendron was particularly affected by short periods of scarce rainfall, which negatively affected gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e and photochemistry, and reduced the remobilization of leaf N and P. Mountain pine was the most tolerant species since alterations of gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, photochemistry and Δ<sup>13</sup>C were not observed. Its highest investment of N in RuBisCo and highest potassium, iron and magnesium leaf concentration contributed to the highest <i>A</i> rates observed.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of drought stress and rewetting on gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid emission patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid emission rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer drought stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid emission rates towards autumn was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid emission rates and more plastic responses to drought stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of drought, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid emission is more variable than expected and sensitive to drought periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific emission assessment accounting for reduced emission during prolonged (summer) drought is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use molecule-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a magnetic molecule, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e interactions with another molecule adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions.

eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and phosphoregulation by the integrated stress response
<p>The integrated stress response (ISR) tunes the rate of protein synthesis. Control is exerted by phosphorylation of the general translation initiation factor eIF2. eIF2 is a guanosine triphosphatase that becomes activated by eIF2B, a two-fold symmetric and heterodecameric complex that functions as eIF2’s dedicated nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e factor. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate into an inhibitor of eIF2B. We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of eIF2 bound to eIF2B in the dephosphorylated state. The structures reveal that the eIF2B decamer is a static platform upon which one or two flexible eIF2 trimers bind and align with eIF2B’s bipartite catalytic centers to catalyze nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e. Phosphorylation refolds eIF2α, allowing it to contact eIF2B at a different interface and, we surmise, thereby sequestering it into a nonproductive complex.</p>

Single-cell Wnt signaling niches maintain stemness of alveolar type 2 cells
<p>Alveoli, the lung’s respiratory units, are tiny sacs where oxygen enters the bloodstream. They are lined by flat alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, which mediate gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, and AT2 cells, which secrete surfactant. Rare AT2s also function as alveolar stem cells. We show that AT2 lung stem cells display active Wnt signaling, and many of them are near single, Wnt-expressing fibroblasts. Blocking Wnt secretion depletes these stem cells. Daughter cells leaving the Wnt niche transdifferentiate into AT1s: Maintaining Wnt signaling prevents transdifferentiation, whereas abrogating Wnt signaling promotes it. Injury induces AT2 autocrine Wnts, recruiting “bulk” AT2s as progenitors. Thus, individual AT2 stem cells reside in single-cell fibroblast niches providing juxtacrine Wnts that maintain them, whereas injury induces autocrine Wnts that transiently expand the progenitor pool. This simple niche maintains the gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e surface and is coopted in cancer.</p>

The role of dimer asymmetry and protomer dynamics in enzyme catalysis
<p>Freeze-trapping x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computational techniques reveal the distribution of states and their interconversion rates along the reaction pathway of a bacterial homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD). The crystal structure of apo-FAcD exhibits asymmetry around the dimer interface and cap domain, priming one protomer for substrate binding. This asymmetry is dynamically averaged through conformational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e on a millisecond time scale. During catalysis, the protomer conformational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e rate becomes enhanced, the empty protomer exhibits increased local disorder, and water egresses. Computational studies identify allosteric pathways between protomers. Water release and enhanced dynamics associated with catalysis compensate for entropic losses from substrate binding while facilitating sampling of the transition state. The studies provide insights into how substrate-coupled allosteric modulation of structure and dynamics facilitates catalysis in a homodimeric enzyme.</p>

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt sensitive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>er protein Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt sensitivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>er SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

The SlCBL10 Calcineurin B-Like Protein Ensures Plant Growth under Salt Stress by Regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Homeostasis<sup>1</sup>
<p>Characterization of a new tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) T-DNA mutant allowed for the isolation of the <i>CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN 10</i> (<i>SlCBL10</i>) gene whose lack of function was responsible for the severe alterations observed in the shoot apex and reproductive organs under salinity conditions. Physiological studies proved that <i>SlCBL10</i> gene is required to maintain a proper low Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio in growing tissues allowing tomato growth under salt stress. Expression analysis of the main responsible genes for Na<sup>+</sup> compartmentalization (i.e. <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> EXCHANGERs</i>, <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE</i>, <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 1;2</i>, <i>H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase AVP1</i> [<i>SlAVP1</i>] and V-ATPase [<i>SlVHA-A1</i>]) supported a reduced capacity to accumulate Na<sup>+</sup> in <i>Slcbl10</i> mutant leaves, which resulted in a lower uploading of Na<sup>+</sup> from xylem, allowing the toxic ion to reach apex and flowers. Likewise, the tomato <i>CATION EXCHANGER 1</i> and <i>TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1</i> (<i>SlTPC1</i>), key genes for Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes to the vacuole, showed abnormal expression in <i>Slcbl10</i> plants indicating an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from vacuole. Additionally, complementation assay revealed that <i>SlCBL10</i> is a true ortholog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>CBL10</i> gene, supporting that the essential function of CBL10 is conserved in Arabidopsis and tomato. Together, the findings obtained in this study provide new insights into the function of <i>SlCBL10</i> in salt stress tolerance. Thus, it is proposed that SlCBL10 mediates salt tolerance by regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes in the vacuole, cooperating with the vacuolar cation channel <i>SlTPC1</i> and the two vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-pumps, <i>SlAVP1</i> and <i>SlVHA-A1</i>, which in turn are revealed as potential targets of <i>SlCBL10</i>.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Linking Auxin with Photosynthetic Rate via Leaf Venation
<p>Land plants lose vast quantities of water to the atmosphere during photosynthetic gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e. In angiosperms, a complex network of veins irrigates the leaf, and it is widely held that the density and placement of these veins determines maximum leaf hydraulic capacity and thus maximum photosynthetic rate. This theory is largely based on interspecific comparisons and has never been tested using vein mutants to examine the specific impact of leaf vein morphology on plant water relations. Here we characterize mutants at the <i>Crispoid</i> (<i>Crd</i>) locus in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), which have altered auxin homeostasis and activity in developing leaves, as well as reduced leaf vein density and aberrant placement of free-ending veinlets. This altered vein phenotype in <i>crd</i> mutant plants results in a significant reduction in leaf hydraulic conductance and leaf gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e. We find <i>Crispoid</i> to be a member of the <i>YUCCA</i> family of auxin biosynthetic genes. Our results link auxin biosynthesis with maximum photosynthetic rate through leaf venation and substantiate the theory that an increase in the density of leaf veins coupled with their efficient placement can drive increases in leaf photosynthetic capacity.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter resistance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch resistance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer resistance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme resistance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type resistance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>ing the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus resistance in the leaves into mild nematode resistance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate resistance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal opening through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal opening. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal opening under red light.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

The Rubisco Chaperone BSD2 May Regulate Chloroplast Coverage in Maize Bundle Sheath Cells
<p>In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), Bundle Sheath Defective2 (BSD2) plays an essential role in Rubisco biogenesis and is required for correct bundle sheath (BS) cell differentiation. Yet, BSD2 RNA and protein levels are similar in mesophyll (M) and BS chloroplasts, although Rubisco accumulates only in BS chloroplasts. This raises the possibility of additional BSD2 roles in cell development. To test this hypothesis, transgenic lines were created that overexpress and underexpress BSD2 in both BS and M cells, driven by the cell type-specific Rubisco Small Subunit (RBCS) or Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC) promoters or the ubiquitin promoter. Genetic crosses showed that each of the transgenes could complement Rubisco deficiency and seedling lethality conferred by the <i>bsd2</i> mutation. This was unexpected, as RBCS-BSD2 lines lacked BSD2 in M chloroplasts and PEPC-BSD2 lines expressed half the wild-type BSD2 level in BS chloroplasts. We conclude that BSD2 does not play a vital role in M cells and that BS BSD2 is in excess of requirements for Rubisco accumulation. BSD2 levels did affect chloroplast coverage in BS cells. In PEPC-BSD2 lines, chloroplast coverage decreased 30% to 50%, whereas lines with increased BSD2 content exhibited a 25% increase. This suggests that BSD2 has an ancillary role in BS cells related to chloroplast size. Gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e showed decreased photosynthetic rates in PEPC-BSD2 lines despite restored Rubisco function, correlating with reduced chloroplast coverage and pointing to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion changes. Conversely, increased chloroplast coverage did not result in increased Rubisco abundance or photosynthetic rates. This suggests another limitation beyond chloroplast volume, most likely Rubisco biogenesis and/or turnover rates.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.</p>

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

<p>In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e between chloroplast and mitochondria ensures efficient photosynthesis under saturating light conditions. The <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant <i>stm6</i> is devoid of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor MOC1 and aberrantly expresses the mitochondrial genome, resulting in enhanced photosynthetic hydrogen production and diminished light tolerance. We analyzed the modulation of mitochondrial and chlororespiration during the acclimation of <i>stm6</i> and the <i>MOC1</i>-complemented strain to excess light. Although light stress stimulated mitochondrial respiration via the energy-conserving cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway in both strains, the mutant was unable to fine-tune the expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation complex I in excess light, which was accompanied by an increased mitochondrial respiration via the alternative oxidase pathway. Furthermore, <i>stm6</i> failed to fully activate chlororespiration and cyclic electron flow due to a more oxidized state of the chloroplast stroma, which is caused by an increased mitochondrial electron sink capacity. Increased susceptibility to photoinhibition of PSII in <i>stm6</i> demonstrates that the MOC1-dependent modulation of mitochondrial respiration helps control the stromal redox poise as a crucial part of high-light acclimation in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect plant gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e that is controlled by stomata, small pores on plant leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land plant groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest plant group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular plants, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land plant stomatal responses.</p>

Modeling of Dolichol Mass Spectra Isotopic Envelopes as a Tool to Monitor Isoprenoid Biosynthesis
<p>The cooperation of the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, operating in parallel in plants to generate isoprenoid precursors, has been studied extensively. Elucidation of the isoprenoid metabolic pathways is indispensable for the rational design of plant and microbial systems for the production of industrially valuable terpenoids. Here, we describe a new method, based on numerical modeling of mass spectra of metabolically labeled dolichols (Dols), designed to quantitatively follow the cooperation of MVA and MEP reprogrammed upon osmotic stress (sorbitol treatment) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contribution of the MEP pathway increased significantly (reaching 100%) exclusively for the dominating Dols, while for long-chain Dols, the relative input of the MEP and MVA pathways remained unchanged, suggesting divergent sites of synthesis for dominating and long-chain Dols. The analysis of numerically modeled Dol mass spectra is a novel method to follow modulation of the concomitant activity of isoprenoid-generating pathways in plant cells; additionally, it suggests an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e of isoprenoid intermediates between plastids and peroxisomes.</p>

Reducing Stomatal Density in Barley Improves Drought Tolerance without Impacting on Yield<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The epidermal patterning factor (EPF) family of secreted signaling peptides regulate the frequency of stomatal development in model dicot and basal land plant species. Here, we identify and manipulate the expression of a barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) ortholog and demonstrate that when overexpressed HvEPF1 limits entry to, and progression through, the stomatal development pathway. Despite substantial reductions in leaf gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, barley plants with significantly reduced stomatal density show no reductions in grain yield. In addition, HvEPF1OE barley lines exhibit significantly enhanced water use efficiency, drought tolerance, and soil water conservation properties. Our results demonstrate the potential of manipulating stomatal frequency for the protection and optimization of cereal crop yields under future drier environments.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing drought tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate drought stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a drought-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> × <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of droughted and irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under drought, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon drought and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. Drought effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of drought-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to drought.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e approaches alongside measurements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

The α-Terpineol to 1,8-Cineole Cyclization Reaction of Tobacco Terpene Synthases
<p>Flowers of <i>Nicotiana</i> species emit a characteristic blend including the cineole cassette monoterpenes. This set of terpenes is synthesized by multiproduct enzymes, with either 1,8-cineole or α-terpineol contributing most to the volatile spectrum, thus referring to cineole or terpineol synthase, respectively. To understand the molecular and structural requirements of the enzymes that favor the biochemical formation of α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole, site-directed mutagenesis, in silico modeling, and semiempiric calculations were performed. Our results indicate the formation of α-terpineol by a nucleophilic attack of water. During this attack, the α-terpinyl cation is stabilized by π-stacking with a tryptophan side chain (tryptophan-253). The hypothesized catalytic mechanism of α-terpineol-to-1,8-cineole conversion is initiated by a catalytic dyad (histidine-502 and glutamate-249), acting as a base, and a threonine (threonine-278) providing the subsequent rearrangement from terpineol to cineol by catalyzing the autoprotonation of (<i>S</i>)-(−)-α-terpineol, which is the favored enantiomer product of the recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to identify amino acids at positions 147, 148, and 266 that determine the different terpineol-cineole ratios in <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>suaveolens</i> cineole synthase and <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>langsdorffii</i> terpineol synthase. Since amino acid 266 is more than 10 ÅÅ away from the active site, an indirect effect of this amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e on the catalysis is discussed.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>ers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium ion current induced by muscarinic stimulation (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct current–voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exchang</span></strong>e current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling draws heat from surfaces and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>es it into space as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infrared radi</span></strong>ation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infrared radi</span></strong>ation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization even under M1-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>izing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Polar Localization of the Borate Exporter BOR1 Requires AP2-Dependent Endocytosis
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element in plants but is toxic when it accumulates to high levels. In root cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the borate exporter BOR1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ly localized in the plasma membrane toward the stele side for directional transport of B. Upon high-B supply, BOR1 is rapidly internalized and degraded in the vacuole. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 are mediated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. To dissect the endocytic pathways mediating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and vacuolar sorting, we investigated the contribution of the clathrin adaptor protein, ADAPTOR PROTEIN2 (AP2) complex, to BOR1 trafficking. In the mutants lacking µ- or σ-subunits of the AP2 complex, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and constitutive endocytosis of BOR1 under low-B conditions were dramatically disturbed. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed association of the AP2 complex with BOR1, while it was independent of YxxΦ sorting motifs, which are in a cytosolic loop of BOR1. A yeast two-hybrid assay supported the interaction of the AP2 complex µ-subunit with the C-terminal tail but not with the YxxΦ motifs in the cytosolic loop of BOR1. Intriguingly, lack of the AP2 subunit did not affect the B-induced rapid internalization/vacuolar sorting of BOR1. Consistent with defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization, the AP2 complex mutants showed hypersensitivity to B deficiency. Our results indicate that AP2-dependent endocytosis maintains the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization of BOR1 to support plant growth under low-B conditions, whereas the B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 is mediated through an AP2-independent endocytic pathway.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized process. However, the mechanism underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity.</p>

Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium
<p>Asymmetric messenger RNA (mRNA) localization facilitates efficient translation in cells such as neurons and fibroblasts. However, the extent and importance of mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization in epithelial tissues are unclear. Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation. This led to increased protein production, required for efficient nutrient absorption. These findings reveal a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism involving dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of mRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized translation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> distribution of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields
<p>Gas transport through metal-organic framework membranes (MOFs) was switched in situ by applying an external electric field (E-field). The switching of gas permeation upon E-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices.

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport, auxin gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal auxin transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) auxin transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper auxin gradients.</p>

A Framework for Lateral Membrane Trafficking and Polar Tethering of the PEN3 ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter
<p>The outermost cell layer of plants, the epidermis, and its outer (lateral) membrane domain facing the environment are continuously challenged by biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, the epidermis and the outer membrane domain provide important selective and protective barriers. However, only a small number of specifically outer membrane-localized proteins are known. Similarly, molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> placement of outer membrane domain proteins require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that ACTIN7 (ACT7) mediates trafficking of the PENETRATION3 (PEN3) outer membrane protein from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and that actin function contributes to PEN3 endocytic recycling. In contrast to such generic ACT7-dependent trafficking from the TGN, the EXOCYST84b (EXO84b) tethering factor mediates PEN3 outer-membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity. Moreover, precise EXO84b placement at the outer membrane domain itself requires ACT7 function. Hence, our results uncover spatially and mechanistically distinct requirements for ACT7 function during outer lateral membrane cargo trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity establishment. They further identify an exocyst tethering complex mediator of outer lateral membrane cargo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Lgl reduces endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling by promoting the interaction between Vap33 and the V-ATPase complex
<p>Epithelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity is linked to the control of tissue growth and tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity protein lethal-2-giant larvae (Lgl) promotes Hippo signaling and inhibits Notch signaling to restrict tissue growth in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Notch signaling is greater in <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue than in wild-type tissue because of increased acidification of endosomal vesicles, which promotes the proteolytic processing and activation of Notch by γ-secretase. We showed that the increased Notch signaling and tissue growth defects of <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue depended on endosomal vesicle acidification mediated by the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). Lgl promoted the activity of the V-ATPase by interacting with Vap33 (VAMP-associated protein of 33 kDa). Vap33 physically and genetically interacted with Lgl and V-ATPase subunits and repressed V-ATPase–mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling. Vap33 overexpression reduced the abundance of the V-ATPase component Vha44, whereas Lgl knockdown reduced the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase component Vha68-3. Our data indicate that Lgl promotes the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase, thus inhibiting V-ATPase–mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and thereby reducing γ-secretase activity, Notch signaling, and tissue growth. Our findings implicate the deregulation of Vap33 and V-ATPase activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity-impaired epithelial cancers.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Dynamic response and hydrodynamics of polarized crowds
<p>Modeling crowd motion is central to situations as diverse as risk prevention in mass events and visual effects rendering in the motion picture industry.

We use tens of thousands of road-race participants in starting corrals to elucidate the flowing behavior of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized crowds by probing its response to boundary motion. We establish that speed information propagates over system-spanning scales through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized crowds, whereas orientational fluctuations are locally suppressed. Building on these observations, we lay out a hydrodynamic theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized crowds and demonstrate its predictive power.

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings

These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

Rapid Pliocene adaptive radiation of modern kangaroos
<p>Differentiating between ancient and younger, more rapidly evolved clades is important for determining paleoenvironmental drivers of diversification. Australia possesses many aridity-adapted lineages, the origins of which have been closely linked to late Miocene continental aridification.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of topology have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of far-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>izations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM.

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion has a particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion affects leaf growth in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B levels present in solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion inhibit maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf growth without causing any other visible stress symptoms, including the accumulation of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibition of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth inhibition and the expression of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to modulate its own transport by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects PIN trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and auxin transport.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α homologs encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β homolog. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in auxin conjugate sensitivity and auxin homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the abundance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced abundance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers, possibly due to impaired PIN recycling and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Gametophyte Development Needs Mitochondrial Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Function
<p>Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is one of the most essential metabolic pathways in almost all organisms. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX in this pathway. Here, we report that mutation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPO-coding gene <i>At5g63290</i> (<i>AtHEMN1</i>) adversely affects silique length, ovule number, and seed set. <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes, but homozygous mutants were never recovered. Plants carrying <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte development, including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclei. Improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm development. Consequently, embryo development was arrested at the globular stage. The mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic expression of <i>AtHEMN1</i>. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that <i>AtHEMN1</i> is expressed mainly in floral tissues and developing seeds. AtHEMN1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria. Loss of <i>AtHEMN1</i> function increased coproporphyrinogen III level and reduced protoporphyrinogen IX level, suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Blockage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the <i>AtHEMN1</i> mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs, as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Our results suggest that the accumulated ROS disrupts mitochondrial function by altering their membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity in floral tissues. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in gametophyte and seed development and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme biosynthesis in plant mitochondria.</p>

Analysis of Exocyst Subunit EXO70 Family Reveals Distinct Membrane Polar Domains in Tobacco Pollen Tubes
<p>The vesicle-tethering complex exocyst is one of the crucial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity regulators. The EXO70 subunit is required for the targeting of the complex and is represented by many isoforms in angiosperm plant cells. This diversity could be partly responsible for the establishment and maintenance of membrane domains with different composition. To address this hypothesis, we employed the growing pollen tube, a well-established cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity model system, and performed large-scale expression, localization, and functional analysis of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) EXO70 isoforms. Various isoforms localized to different regions of the pollen tube plasma membrane, apical vesicle-rich inverted cone region, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The overexpression of major pollen-expressed EXO70 isoforms resulted in growth arrest and characteristic phenotypic deviations of tip swelling and apical invaginations. NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 occupied two distinct and mutually exclusive plasma membrane domains. Both isoforms partly colocalized with the exocyst subunit NtSEC3a at the plasma membrane, possibly forming different exocyst complex subpopulations. NtEXO70A1a localized to the small area previously characterized as the site of exocytosis in the tobacco pollen tube, while NtEXO70B1 surprisingly colocalized with the zone of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 colocalized to different degrees with markers for the anionic signaling phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. In contrast, members of the EXO70 C class, which are specifically expressed in tip-growing cells, exhibited exocytosis-related functional effects in pollen tubes despite the absence of apparent plasma membrane localization. Taken together, our data support the existence of multiple membrane-trafficking domains regulated by different EXO70-containing exocyst complexes within a single cell.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels
<p>Fatigue failures create enormous risks for all engineered structures, as well as for human lives, motivating large safety factors in design and, thus, inefficient use of resources. Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue resistance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel microstructures are hierarchical and laminated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong> resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong> propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response. The exceptional properties enabled by this strategy provide guidance for all fatigue-resistant alloy design efforts.</p>

Restoration of Large Damage Volumes in Polymers
<sec><title>Self-Healing Larger Wounds</title><p>By loading a polymer with pockets of monomer, it is possible to heal small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong>s in a sample through the polymerization of the monomer following the formation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong>. However, large holes are much harder to repair. <bold>White <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 620; see the Perspective by <bold>Zhao and Arruda</bold>) developed a vascular-like repair system involving a dual-stage strategy to self-heal epoxy thermosets. After injecting a damaged site with precursors, a gel with reversible cross-links rapidly formed, so the material stayed in place that then solidified further upon cross-linking. The approach successfully patched holes larger than 3 centimeters in diameter.</p></sec>

The ribosome, revealed
<p>By the late 1970s, the structure of DNA had already been "solved," and the genetic code already "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong>ed," leading many to conclude that there was little left to learn in this arena. However, the quest to understand the process by which the ribosome converts genetic information into proteins was still in its infancy. In <i>Gene Machine</i>, Venki Ramakrishnan provides a frank behind-the-scenes account of the 30-year race to solve the structure of the ribosome that earned him a share of the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2009.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for separating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular separations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong>ing. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically separate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging separations.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong>s in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong>s, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice charge transport mobility to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of polymers to substantially improve the stretchability of polymer semiconductors, without affecting charge transport mobility. The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crack</span></strong> formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable transistors exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.</p>

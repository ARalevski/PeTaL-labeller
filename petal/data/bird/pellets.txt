Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shot</span></strong>s. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the vaccine varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the vaccine had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the vaccine change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the vaccine being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the vaccine during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their immune system toward a response that undermines that vaccine-triggered immunity. And the vaccine strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the vaccine and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shot</span></strong> that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

A Josephson relation for fractionally charged anyons
<p>Anyons occur in two-dimensional electron systems as excitations with fractional charge in the topologically ordered states of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Their dynamics are of utmost importance for topological quantum phases and possible decoherence-free quantum information approaches, but observing these dynamics experimentally is challenging. Here, we report on a dynamical property of anyons: the long-predicted Josephson relation <i>f</i><sub>J </sub>= <i>e</i>*<i>V</i>/<i>h</i> for charges <i>e</i>* = <i>e</i>/3 and <i>e</i>/5, where <i>e</i> is the charge of the electron and <i>h</i> is Planck’s constant. The relation manifests itself as marked signatures in the dependence of photo-assisted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shot</span></strong> noise (PASN) on voltage <i>V</i> when irradiating contacts at microwaves frequency <i>f</i><sub>J</sub>. The validation of FQHE PASN models indicates a path toward realizing time-resolved anyon sources based on levitons.</p>

Measles epidemic in Ukraine drove troubling European year
<p>Measles cases surged to nearly 83,000 in Europe in 2018—a 21st-century record and more than triple number in 2017, the World Health Organization announced last week. Driving the number was a massive and growing outbreak in Ukraine, where more than 54,000 cases were reported in 2018 and more than 15,000 have been logged already in 2019. Measles is extremely contagious and vaccine-preventable. Its complications can kill.The Ukranian epidemic stems from a decade of vaccine resistance and from vaccine supply disruptions after political upheaval and armed conflict broke out in 2014. In 2016, just 31% of Ukranian 6-year-olds had received the recommended two measles <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shot</span></strong>s—a rate among the lowest in the world. "It's egregious to have people have measles in the 21st century in a European country," says Ulana Suprun, Ukraine's acting minister of health, who is steering an urgent government response to the epidemic.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity measurement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the measurement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to measurement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shot</span></strong> measurement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the measurement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise
<p>In modern microelectronic devices, hot electrons accelerate, scatter, and dissipate energy in nanoscale dimensions. Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-electron energy dissipation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the electrons. We realize electronic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shot</span></strong> noise, associated with ultrafast hot-electron kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-electron distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide crystal lattice. With nanoconstriction devices, we reveal unexpected nonlocal energy dissipation at room temperature, which is reminiscent of ballistic transport of low-temperature quantum conductors.</p>

Entanglement distillation between solid-state quantum network nodes
<p>The impact of future quantum networks hinges on high-quality quantum entanglement shared between network nodes. Unavoidable imperfections necessitate a means to improve remote entanglement by local quantum operations. We realize entanglement distillation on a quantum network primitive of distant electron-nuclear two-qubit nodes. The heralded generation of two copies of a remote entangled state is demonstrated through single-photon–mediated entangling of the electrons and robust storage in the nuclear spins. After applying local two-qubit gates, single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shot</span></strong> measurements herald the distillation of an entangled state with increased fidelity that is available for further use. The key combination of generating, storing, and processing entangled states should enable the exploration of multiparticle entanglement on an extended quantum network.</p>

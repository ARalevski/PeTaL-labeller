A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es and transistors generate strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic devices can produce strong and controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that could enable high-bandwidth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic quantum information processing.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear optical phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions. These observations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

An integrated diamond nanophotonics platform for quantum-optical networks
<p>Efficient interfaces between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s and quantum emitters form the basis for quantum networks and enable optical nonlinearities at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level.

By measuring intensity correlations of indistinguishable Raman <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s emitted into a single waveguide, we observe a quantum interference effect resulting from the superradiant emission of two entangled SiV centers.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in which the entanglement persists over five sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s.

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a one-dimensional array of 12 superconducting qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the superconducting qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks by exciting two superconducting qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using superconducting qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Quantum entanglement of the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons using metamaterials
<p>Metamaterials constructed from deep subwavelength building blocks have been used to demonstrate phenomena ranging from negative refractive index and Îµ-near-zero to cloaking, emulations of general relativity, and superresolution imaging. More recently, metamaterials have been suggested as a new platform for quantum optics.

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image wave-packet trajectories through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> excitation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear wave packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions. These findings benchmark and validate ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics calculations.</p>

Hierarchical reasoning by neural circuits in the frontal cortex
<p>Humans process information hierarchically. In the presence of hierarchies, sources of failures are ambiguous. Humans resolve this ambiguity by assessing their confidence after one or more attempts. To understand the neural basis of this reasoning strategy, we recorded from dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of monkeys in a task in which negative outcomes were caused either by misjudging the stimulus or by a covert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> between two stimulus-response contingency rules. We found that both areas harbored a representation of evidence supporting a rule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>. Additional perturbation experiments revealed that ACC functioned downstream of DMFC and was directly and specifically involved in inferring covert rule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es.

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong magnetic field, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currentsâthe so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge field is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge field and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial magnetic field in three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics.</p>

Quantum metasurface for multiphoton interference and state reconstruction
<p>Metasurfaces based on resonant nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic structures have enabled innovative types of flat-optics devices that often outperform the capabilities of bulk components, yet these advances remain largely unexplored for quantum applications. We show that nonclassical multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interferences can be achieved at the subwavelength scale in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust reconstruction of amplitude, phase, coherence, and entanglement of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> polarization-encoded states. One- and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> states are reconstructed through nonlocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation measurements with polarization-insensitive click detectors positioned after the metasurface, and the scalability to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> numbers is established theoretically.

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems.

The recent advent of hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon.

Asymmetric distribution and spatial switching of dynein activity generates ciliary motility
<p>Motile cilia and flagella are essential, highly conserved organelles, and their motility is driven by the coordinated activities of multiple dynein isoforms. The prevailing â<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>-pointâ hypothesis posits that dyneins are asymmetrically activated to drive flagellar bending. To test this model, we applied cryoâelectron tomography to visualize activity states of individual dyneins relative to their locations along beating flagella of sea urchin sperm cells. As predicted, bending was generated by the asymmetric distribution of dynein activity on opposite sides of the flagellum. However, contrary to predictions, most dyneins were in their active state, and the smaller population of conformationally inactive dyneins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ed flagellar sides relative to the bending direction. Thus, our data suggest a â<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>-inhibitionâ mechanism in which force imbalance is generated by inhibiting, rather than activating, dyneins on alternating sides of the flagellum.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon

The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet.

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing of gas permeation upon E-field polarization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices. Permeation measurements under a direct-current E-field poling of 500 volts per millimeter showed reversibly controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing of the ZIF-8 into polar polymorphs, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations. The stiffening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability. Dielectric spectroscopy, polarization, and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed low-frequency resonances of ZIF-8 that we attribute to lattice flexibility and linker movement. Upon E-field polarization, we observed a defibrillation of the different lattice motions.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

At 878 Î¼atm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 Î¼atm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 Î¼atm and 878 Î¼atm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 Î¼mol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>â2</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities.

The transcription factor Lef1 switches partners from Î²-catenin to Smad3 during muscle stem cell quiescence
<p>Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, persist in adult mammals by entering a state of quiescence (G<sub>0</sub>) during the early postnatal period. Quiescence is reversed during damage-induced regeneration and re-established after regeneration. Entry of cultured myoblasts into G<sub>0</sub> is associated with a specific, reversible induction of Wnt target genes, thus implicating members of the Tcf and Lef1 (Tcf/Lef) transcription factor family, which mediate transcriptional responses to Wnt signaling, in the initiation of quiescence. We found that the canonical Wnt effector Î²-catenin, which cooperates with Tcf/Lef, was dispensable for myoblasts to enter quiescence. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches in cultured C2C12 myoblasts and in MuSCs, we demonstrated that Tcf/Lef activity during quiescence depended not on Î²-catenin but on the transforming growth factorâÎ² (TGF-Î²) effector and transcriptional coactivator Smad3, which colocalized with Lef1 at canonical Wnt-responsive elements and directly interacted with Lef1 specifically in G<sub>0</sub>. Depletion of Smad3, but not Î²-catenin, reduced Lef1 occupancy at target promoters, Tcf/Lef target gene expression, and self-renewal of myoblasts. In vivo, MuSCs underwent a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> from Î²-cateninâLef1 to Smad3-Lef1 interactions during the postnatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> from proliferation to quiescence, with Î²-cateninâLef1 interactions recurring during damage-induced reactivation. Our findings suggest that the interplay of Wnt-Tcf/Lef and TGF-Î²âSmad3 signaling activates canonical Wnt target promoters in a manner that depends on Î²-catenin during myoblast proliferation but is independent of Î²-catenin during MuSC quiescence.</p>

Extension of chemotactic pseudopods by nonadherent human neutrophils does not require or cause calcium bursts
<p>Global bursts in free intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are among the most conspicuous signaling events in immune cells. To test the common view that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the activation of G proteinâcoupled receptors, we combined single-cell manipulation with fluorescence imaging and monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in individual human neutrophils during complement-mediated chemotaxis. By decoupling purely chemotactic pseudopod formation from cell-substrate adhesion, we showed that physiological concentrations of anaphylatoxins, such as C5a, induced nonadherent human neutrophils to form chemotactic pseudopods but did not elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts. By contrast, pathological or supraphysiological concentrations of C5a often triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts, but pseudopod protrusion stalled or reversed in such cases, effectively halting chemotaxis, similar to sepsis-associated neutrophil paralysis. The maximum increase in cell surface area during pseudopod extension in pure chemotaxis was much smallerâby a factor of 8âthan the known capacity of adherent human neutrophils to expand their surface. Because the measured rise in cortical tension was not sufficient to account for this difference, we attribute the limited deformability to a reduced ability of the cytoskeleton to generate protrusive force in the absence of cell adhesion. Thus, we hypothesize that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts in neutrophils control a mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> between two distinct modes of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. A key element of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> appears to be the expedient coordination of adhesion-dependent lock or release events of cytoskeletal membrane anchors.</p>

cAMPr: A single-wavelength fluorescent sensor for cyclic AMP
<p>Genetically encoded fluorescent sensors enable cell-specific measurements of ions and small molecules in real time. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is one of the most important signaling molecules in virtually all cell types and organisms. We describe cAMPr, a new single-wavelength cAMP sensor. We developed cAMPr in bacteria and embryonic stem cells and validated the sensor in mammalian neurons in vitro and in <i>Drosophila</i> circadian pacemaker neurons in intact brains. Comparison with other single-wavelength cAMP sensors showed that cAMPr improved the quantitative detection of cAMP abundance. In addition, cAMPr is compatible with both single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> imaging. This enabled us to use cAMPr together with the red fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor RCaMP1h to simultaneously monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP in <i>Drosophila</i> brains.

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the Î²<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA abundance in patients, suggesting that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/Î²<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other tumors.</p>

Acetylation-dependent regulation of MDM2 E3 ligase activity dictates its oncogenic function
<p>Abnormal activation of the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is frequently observed in human cancers. By ubiquitinating the tumor suppressor p53 protein, which leads to its proteasome-mediated destruction, MDM2 limits the tumor-suppressing activity of p53. On the other hand, by ubiquitinating itself, MDM2 targets itself for destruction and promotes the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, a process that can be antagonized by the deubiquitinase herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP). We investigated the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity and found that acetyltransferase p300âmediated acetylation and stabilization of MDM2 are molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es that block self-ubiquitination, thereby shifting its E3 ligase activity toward p53. In vitro and in cancer cell lines, p300-mediated acetylation of MDM2 on Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup> enabled HAUSP to bind, presumably deubiquitinate, and stabilize MDM2. This acetylation within the nuclear localization signal domain decreased its interaction with the acidic domain, subsequently increased the interaction between the acidic domain and RING domain in MDM2, enabled the binding of HAUSP to the acidic domain in MDM2, and shifted MDM2 activity from autoubiquitination to p53 ubiquitination. However, upon genotoxic stress through exposure to etoposide, the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylated MDM2 at Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup>, thereby promoting self-ubiquitination and less ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, thus increasing p53-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates that dynamic acetylation is a molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> in the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity, revealing further insight into the posttranslational regulation of the MDM2/p53 cell survival axis.</p>

Allele-specific epigenome maps reveal sequence-dependent stochastic switching at regulatory loci

An intrinsic S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint enforced by ATR

Control mechanisms establish this order by dictating when a cell transitions from one phase to the next. Much is known about the control of the G<sub>1</sub>/S, G<sub>2</sub>/M, and metaphase/anaphase transitions, but thus far, no control mechanism has been identified for the S/G<sub>2</sub> transition. Here we show that cells transactivate the mitotic gene network as they exit the S phase through a CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1)âdirected FOXM1 phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>. During normal DNA replication, the checkpoint kinase ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is activated by ETAA1 to block this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> until the S phase ends. ATR inhibition prematurely activates FOXM1, deregulating the S/G<sub>2</sub> transition and leading to early mitosis, underreplicated DNA, and DNA damage. Thus, ATR couples DNA replication with mitosis and preserves genome integrity by enforcing an S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>es from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Positive selections were detected with proteinases (i.e., <i>CTRC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) and lipases (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, and <i>PNLIP</i>) suggesting that cetaceans have evolved an enhanced digestion capacity for proteins and lipids, the major nutritional components of their prey (fishes and invertebrates). In addition, it was found that <i>RNASE1</i> gene duplicated after the cetartiodactylan speciation and two independent gene duplication events took place in Camelidae and Ruminantia. Positive selection was detected with <i>RNASE1</i> of Camelidae and Bovidae, suggesting enhanced digestive efficiency in the ruminants. Remarkably, even though the ancestors of cetaceans were terrestrial artiodactyls that are herbivorous, modern cetaceans lost the pancreatic <i>RNASE1</i> copy with digestive function, which is in accordance with the dietary change from herbivorous to carnivorous. In sum, this is the first study that provides new insights into the evolutionary mechanism of dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> in cetaceans.</p>

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its target genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular diseases. Furthermore, normal and diseased human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase-C Suppresses cAMP Formation in Human Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Chronic heart failure (HF) is associated with altered signal transduction via Î²-adrenoceptors and G proteins and with reduced cAMP formation. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are enriched at the plasma membrane of patients with end-stage HF, but the functional consequences of this are largely unknown, particularly for NDPK-C. Here, we investigated the potential role of NDPK-C in cardiac cAMP formation and contractility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Real-time polymerase chain reaction, (far) Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry were used to study the expression, interaction with G proteins, and localization of NDPKs. cAMP levels were determined with immunoassays or fluorescent resonance energy transfer, and contractility was determined in cardiomyocytes (cell shortening) and in vivo (fractional shortening).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>NDPK-C was essential for the formation of an NDPK-B/G protein complex. Protein and mRNA levels of NDPK-C were upregulated in end-stage human HF, in rats after long-term isoprenaline stimulation through osmotic minipumps, and after incubation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes with isoprenaline. Isoprenaline also promoted translocation of NDPK-C to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of NDPK-C in cardiomyocytes increased cAMP levels and sensitized cardiomyocytes to isoprenaline-induced augmentation of contractility, whereas NDPK-C knockdown decreased cAMP levels. In vivo, depletion of NDPK-C in zebrafish embryos caused cardiac edema and ventricular dysfunction. NDPK-B knockout mice had unaltered NDPK-C expression but showed contractile dysfunction and exacerbated cardiac remodeling during long-term isoprenaline stimulation. In human end-stage HF, the complex formation between NDPK-C and GÎ±<sub>i2</sub> was increased whereas the NDPK-C/GÎ±<sub>s</sub> interaction was decreased, producing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong> that may contribute to an NDPK-Câdependent cAMP reduction in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify NDPK-C as an essential requirement for both the interaction between NDPK isoforms and between NDPK isoforms and G proteins. NDPK-C is a novel critical regulator of Î²-adrenoceptor/cAMP signaling and cardiac contractility. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">switch</span></strong>ing from GÎ±<sub>s</sub> to GÎ±<sub>i2</sub> activation, NDPK-C may contribute to lower cAMP levels and the related contractile dysfunction in HF.</p></sec>

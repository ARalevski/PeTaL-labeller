Rewritable multi-event analog recording in bacterial and mammalian cells
<p>We present two CRISPR-mediated analog multi-event <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing apparatus (CAMERA) systems that use base editors and Cas9 nucleases to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> cellular events in bacteria and mammalian cells. The devices <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> signal amplitude or duration as changes in the ratio of mutually exclusive DNA sequences (CAMERA 1) or as single-base modifications (CAMERA 2). We achieved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing of multiple stimuli in bacteria or mammalian cells, including exposure to antibiotics, nutrients, viruses, light, and changes in Wnt signaling. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing to multicopy plasmids, reliable readout requires as few as 10 to 100 cells. The order of stimuli can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed through an overlapping guide RNA design, and memories can be erased and re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed over multiple cycles. CAMERA systems serve as “cell data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ers” that write a history of endogenous or exogenous signaling events into permanent DNA sequence modifications in living cells.</p>

‘CAMERA’ records cell action with new CRISPR tricks
<p>Biologists long have devised ways to track the inner working of cells, tagging genes with fluorescent proteins and the like to better understand diseases, embryology, and environmental impacts. With the advent of CRISPR, best known as a genome editing tool, many groups have tried to fashion novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing devices. In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that float around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er one to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which works in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base editor to alter the DNA in a "safe harbor" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe harbor gene's sequence can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells
<p>The retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological processes. To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream activation sequence–green fluorescent protein (UAS-GFP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)–induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma activated Gal4-UAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA ligands. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand that was greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together, these data suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.</p>

Quality of Care at Hospitals Identified as Outliers in Publicly Reported Mortality Statistics for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ing of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes may create disincentives for physicians to provide care for critically ill patients, particularly at institutions with worse clinical outcomes. We thus sought to evaluate the procedural management and in-hospital outcomes of patients treated for acute myocardial infarction before and after a hospital had been publicly identified as a negative outlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>s, we identified hospitals that were recognized as negative PCI outliers in 2 states (Massachusetts and New York) from 2002 to 2012. State hospitalization files were used to identify all patients with an acute myocardial infarction within these states. Procedural management and in-hospital outcomes were compared among patients treated at outlier hospitals before and after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of outlier status. Patients at nonoutlier institutions were used to control for temporal trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 86 hospitals, 31 were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed as outliers for excess mortality. Outlier facilities were larger, treating more patients with acute myocardial infarction and performing more PCIs than nonoutlier hospitals (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). Among 507 672 patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at these institutions, 108 428 (21%) were treated at an outlier hospital after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>. The likelihood of PCI at outlier (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.15) and nonoutlier institutions (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11–1.14) increased in a similar fashion (interaction <i>P</i>=0.50) after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of outlier status. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81–0.85) after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>, and to a lesser degree at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.92; interaction <i>P</i><0.001). Among patients that underwent PCI, in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions after public recognition of outlier status in comparison with prior (RR, 0.72; 9% CI, 0.66–0.79), a decline that exceeded the reduction at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96; interaction <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Large hospitals with higher clinical volume are more likely to be designated as negative outliers. The rates of percutaneous revascularization increased similarly at outlier and nonoutlier institutions after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of outlier status. After outlier designation, in-hospital mortality declined at outlier institutions to a greater extent than was observed at nonoutlier facilities.</p></sec>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed by law. We obtained comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The availability and diversity of lower limb revascularization procedures have increased in England in the past decade. We investigated whether these developments in care have translated to improvements in patient pathways and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Individual-patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s from Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify 103 934 patients who underwent endovascular (angioplasty) or surgical (endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or bypass) lower limb revascularization for infrainguinal peripheral artery disease in England between January 2006 and December 2015. Major lower limb amputations and deaths within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of major amputation and death, adjusted for patient age, sex, comorbidity score, indication for the intervention (intermittent claudication, severe limb ischemia without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of tissue loss, severe limb ischemia with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of ulceration, severe limb ischemia with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of gangrene/osteomyelitis), and comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated 1-year risk of major amputation decreased from 5.7% (in 2006–2007) to 3.9% (in 2014–2015) following endovascular revascularization, and from 11.2% (2006–2007) to 6.6% (2014–2015) following surgical procedures. The risk of death after both types of revascularization also decreased. These trends were observed for all indication categories, with the largest reductions found in patients with severe limb ischemia with ulceration or gangrene. Overall, morbidity increased over the study period, and a larger proportion of patients was treated for the severe end of the peripheral artery disease spectrum using less invasive procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings show that from 2006 to 2015, the overall survival increased and the risk of major lower limb amputation decreased following revascularization.

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed a stroke rate >2% per year.

These variations can affect the point score threshold for recommending oral anticoagulants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke rates that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for anticoagulating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

Impact of Combat Deployment and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Newly Reported Coronary Heart Disease Among US Active Duty and Reserve Forces
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed thousands of service members to intense stress, and as a result, many have developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of military deployment experiences and PTSD in coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well defined, especially in young US service members with recent combat exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the relationships between wartime experiences, PTSD, and CHD. Current and former US military personnel from all service branches participating in the Millennium Cohort Study during 2001 to 2008 (n=60 025) were evaluated for newly self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed CHD. Electronic medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> review for <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> codes for CHD was conducted among a subpopulation of active duty members (n=23 794). Logistic regression models examined the associations between combat experiences and PTSD with CHD with adjustment for established CHD risk factors. A total of 627 participants (1.0%) newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed CHD over an average of 5.6 years of follow-up. Deployers with combat experiences had an increased odds of newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ing CHD (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.40) and having a diagnosis code for new-onset CHD (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.84) compared with noncombat deployers. Screening positive for PTSD symptoms was associated with self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed CHD before but not after adjustment for depression and anxiety and was not associated with a new diagnosis code for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Combat deployments are associated with new-onset CHD among young US service members and veterans.

East Asian hydroclimate modulated by the position of the westerlies during Termination I
<p>Speleothem oxygen isotope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s have revolutionized our understanding of the paleo East Asian monsoon, yet there is fundamental disagreement on what they represent in terms of the hydroclimate changes. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> a multiproxy speleothem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of monsoon evolution during the last deglaciation from the middle Yangtze region, which indicates a wetter central eastern China during North Atlantic cooling episodes, despite the oxygen isotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> suggesting a weaker monsoon. We show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved if the changes are interpreted as a lengthening of the Meiyu rains and shortened post-Meiyu stage, in accordance with a recent hypothesis. Model simulations support this interpretation and further reveal the role of the westerlies in communicating the North Atlantic influence to the East Asian climate.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape

We developed a “biological tape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er” in which biological signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling biological events on a large scale.</p>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from vaccine studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika vaccines, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each vaccine and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika vaccine that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>. Other experimental maternal immunizations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, includes pregnant women. A vaccine against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too. A second new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> on maternal immunizations issued last week explores the challenges of doing safety studies in these women and their babies.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain data are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed bite force.

Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

The indications for isolated modular   component revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%).

Infection is the most common indication   for modular and non-modular component revision. Aseptic loosening   was not an uncommon cause of failure, however, it was much less   common than in national registry and non-registry data. Focusing   on posterior-stabilised TKAs initially performed at our institution   allowed for an accurate assessment of the causes of failure in a   contemporary specialty practice.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:647–52.</p></sec>

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 fractures by performing a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 fracture, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of fracture. Studies were also required to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the rate of re-operation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 fractures and 167 B3 fractures. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 fractures, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with revision   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-operation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 fractures, the treatment in 160 (95.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without revision.

Its purpose is to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> outcomes of clinical safety and performance after European approval was given.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present the 30-day outcome of the SOURCE 3 Registry. All data are self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed, and all participating centers have committed to support their consecutive experience with the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve, dependent on patient consent, before the start of the study. Adverse events are defined with Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 criteria and adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1950 patients from 80 centers in 10 countries were enrolled between July 2014 and October 2015. Of those, 1947 patients underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with the SAPIEN 3 (mean age, 81.6±6.6 years; 48.1% female). Main comorbidities included coronary artery disease (51.5%), renal insufficiency (27.4%), diabetes mellitus (29.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.0%), and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 18.3±13.2. Transfemoral access was used in 87.1% (n=1695); nontransfemoral, in 252 patients. Conscious sedation was used in 59.9% of transfemoral procedures, and in 50% of patients, TAVI was performed without aortic balloon valvuloplasty.

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed apo-structure with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Developmental barcoding of whole mouse via homing CRISPR

We used these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings for reliable post hoc reconstruction of the earliest lineages and investigation of axis development in the brain.

A method for single-neuron chronic recording from the retina in awake mice

The threshold for conscious report: Signal loss and response bias in visual and frontal cortex
<p>Why are some visual stimuli consciously detected, whereas others remain subliminal? We investigated the fate of weak visual stimuli in the visual and frontal cortex of awake monkeys trained to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> stimulus presence. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed stimuli were associated with strong sustained activity in the frontal cortex, and frontal activity was weaker and quickly decayed for un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed stimuli. Information about weak stimuli could be lost at successive stages en route from the visual to the frontal cortex, and these propagation failures were confirmed through microstimulation of area V1. Fluctuations in response bias and sensitivity during perception of identical stimuli were traced back to prestimulus brain-state markers. A model in which stimuli become consciously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>able when they elicit a nonlinear ignition process in higher cortical areas explained our results.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that strategies that promote student interactions and cognitively engage students with content (<i>1</i>) lead to gains in learning and attitudinal outcomes for students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>).

That a panel appointed by the Cuban government dismisses the U.S. claims may not be surprising, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still leading what State Department officials have described as a "vigorous" multiagency investigation. But the Cuban <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> summary, obtained by <i>Science</i>, reveals intriguing details.

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some auxin signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 auxin signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. Auxin treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some auxin signaling components.</p>

The <i>6xABRE</i> Synthetic Promoter Enables the Spatiotemporal Analysis of ABA-Mediated Transcriptional Regulation
<p>The water stress-associated hormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts through a well-defined signal transduction cascade to mediate downstream transcriptional events important for acclimation to stress. Although ABA signaling is known to function in specific tissues to regulate root growth, little is understood regarding the spatial pattern of ABA-mediated transcriptional regulation. Here, we describe the construction and evaluation of an ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENT (ABRE)-based synthetic promoter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er that reveals the transcriptional response of tissues to different levels of exogenous ABA and stresses. Genome-scale yeast one-hybrid screens complemented these approaches and revealed how promoter sequence and architecture affect the recruitment of diverse transcription factors (TFs) to the ABRE. Our analysis also revealed ABA-independent activity of the ABRE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er under nonstress conditions, with expression being enriched at the quiescent center and stem cell niche. We show that the WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX5 and NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN13 TFs regulate QC/SCN expression of the ABRE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er, which highlights the convergence of developmental and DNA-damage signaling pathways onto this cis-element in the absence of water stress. This work establishes a tool to study the spatial pattern of ABA-mediated transcriptional regulation and a repertoire of TF-ABRE interactions that contribute to the developmental and environmental control of gene expression in roots.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

NTL8 Regulates Trichome Formation in Arabidopsis by Directly Activating R3 MYB Genes <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>
<p>The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) are plant-specific transcription factors that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development and plant response to environmental stimuli. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> here the identification of NTM1-LIKE8 (NTL8), a membrane-associated NAC transcription factor, as a novel regulator of trichome formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). From an activation-tagged Arabidopsis population, we identified a dominant, gain-of-function mutant with glabrous inflorescence stem. By using plasmid rescue and RT-PCR analyses, we found that <i>NTL8</i> was tagged; thus, the mutant was named <i>ntl8-1 Dominant</i> (<i>ntl8-1D</i>). Recapitulation experiment further confirmed that the phenotype observed in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant was caused by elevated expression of <i>NTL8</i>. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of the single-repeat R3 MYB genes <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> (<i>TRY</i>) and <i>TRICHOMELESS1</i> (<i>TCL1</i>) was elevated in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant. Genetic analyses demonstrated that NTL8 acts upstream of TRY and TCL1 in the regulation of trichome formation. When recruited to the promoter region of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er gene <i>Gal4:GUS</i> by a fused GAL4 DNA-binding domain, NTL8 activated the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i> are direct targets of NTL8. However, NTL8 did not interact with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE9, another transcription factor that regulates the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>, in yeast and plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NTL8 negatively regulates trichome formation in Arabidopsis by directly activating the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>.</p>

<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the plastid genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid genome currently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

Late presentation of developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Despite the presence of screening programmes, infants continue   to present with late developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the   impact of which is significant. The aim of this study was to assess   infants with late presenting dislocation of the hip despite universal   clinical neonatal and selective ultrasound screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 01 January 1997 to 31 December 2011, a prospective, longitudinal   study was undertaken of a cohort of 64 670 live births. Late presenting   dislocation was defined as presentation after three months of age.   Diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound and plain radiography. Patient   demographics, referral type, reason for referral, risk factors (breech   presentation/strong family history) and clinical and radiological   findings were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 31 infants with an irreducible dislocation of the   hip, an incidence of 0.48   (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.68) per 1000 live births.   Of these, 18 (0.28 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.44) per 1000 live births; 58%)   presented late.

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic fracture.   This study aims to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing fracture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   Revisions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the largest independent study of CoC bearing fractures   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head fracture but not of liner fracture. Small head   size and high patient BMI are associated with an increased risk   of ceramic bearing fracture.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1012–19.</p></sec>

Quality of life after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to compare measures of the quality of   life (QOL) after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine with   the national averages in the United States and to assess which factors   influenced the QOL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and coping   with pain post-operatively in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 48 consecutive patients who underwent resection of   a primary or recurrent chordoma of the mobile spine between 2000   and 2015 were included. A total of 34 patients completed a survey   at least 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was the   EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire.

Discharge on the day of surgery following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty within the United Kingdom NHS
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been successfully   performed in the United States healthcare system on outpatients.   Despite differences in healthcare structure and financial environment,   we hypothesised that it would be feasible to replicate this success   and perform UKA with safe day of surgery discharge within the NHS,   in the United Kingdom. This has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed in any other United   Kingdom centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> our experience of implementing a pathway to allow safe   day of surgery discharge following UKA. Data were prospectively   collected on 72 patients who underwent UKA as a day case between   December 2011 and September 2015. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 61 patients (85%) were discharged on the same day.   The most common reason for failure was logistical; five patients   had their operation too late in the day. Three patients failed to   mobilise safely, two had inadequate control of pain and one had   a leaking wound. The mean length of stay for those who were not   discharged on the same day was 1.2 nights (1 to 3). During the same   time, 58 patients underwent planned inpatient UKA, as they were deemed   inappropriate for discharge on the day of surgery.

Cement-in-cement revision of the femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Compared with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), revision   surgery can be challenging. The cement-in-cement femoral revision   technique involves removing a femoral component from a well-fixed   femoral cement mantle and cementing a new stem into the original   mantle. This technique is widely used and when carried out for the   correct indications, is fast, relatively inexpensive and carries   a reduced short-term risk for the patient compared with the alternative   of removing well-fixed cement. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the outcomes of this procedure   when two commonly used femoral stems are used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 1179 cement-in-cement stem revisions involving   an Exeter or a Lubinus stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed to the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register (SHAR) between January 1999 and December 2015.

Long-term outcome of carpal tunnel release surgery in patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies have examined the long-term outcome of carpal tunnel   release (CTR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed   long-term outcome of CTR for electrophysiologically severe carpal   tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the long-term outcome of 40 patients with bilateral   severe CTS who underwent 80 CTRs (46 open, 34 endoscopic) between   2002 and 2012. The outcomes studied were patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed outcomes   of numbness resolution, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ)   score, and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 9.3 years. Complete resolution of numbness   was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed by 93.8% of patients, persistent numbness by 3.8%,   and recurrent numbness by 2.5%. The mean BCTQ symptom score was   1.1 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.3; 1.0 to 2.55) and the mean Boston function   score was 1.15 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.46; 1.0 to 3.5). 72.5% of patients   were asymptomatic and had no functional impairment. Men had poorer   outcomes than women and patients < 55 years had poorer outcomes   than patients ≥ 55 years. All patients who had undergone endoscopic   CTR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed complete resolution of numbness compared with 89.1%   of those who had undergone open release (p = 0.047).

The use of the distal radius and ulna classification for the prediction of growth
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the use of the distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification   for the prediction of peak growth (PG) and growth cessation (GC)   in 777 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. We compare this classification   with other commonly used parameters of maturity.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The following data were extracted from the patients’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s   and radiographs: chronological age, body height (BH), arm span (AS),   date of menarche, Risser sign, DRU grade and status of the phalangeal   and metacarpal physes. The mean rates of growth were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed according   to each parameter of maturity. PG was defined as the summit of the curve   and GC as the plateau in deceleration of growth. The rates of growth   at PG and GC were used for analysis using receiver operating characteristic   (ROC) curves to determine the strength and cutoff values of the   parameters of growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most specific grades for PG using the DRU classification   were radial grade 6 and ulnar grade 5, and for GC were radial grade   9 and ulnar grade 7. The DRU classification spanned both PG and   GC, enabling better prediction of these clinically relevant stages   than other methods. The rate of PG (≥ 0.7 cm/month) and GC (≤ 0.15   cm/month) was the same for girls and boys, in BH and AS measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to note that the DRU classification can   predict both PG and GC, providing evidence that it may aid the management   of patients with idiopathic scoliosis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1689–96.</p></sec>

Medium-term outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiological   outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective review of all 95 Universal-2 TWAs which   were performed in our institution between 2003 to 2012 in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis. A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a mean   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The mean follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing pain on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.

Depression Treatment and 1-Year Mortality After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed in the medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9<10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 759 (18.7%) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4%) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1% versus 6.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8% versus 6.1%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.39–2.62).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although depression in patients with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to patients with untreated depression.</p></sec>

Altered DNA Methylation of Long Noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Promotes Mineralization by Silencing <i>NOTCH1</i>
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcific aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal mineralization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of <i>NOTCH1</i>, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed that lncRNA <i>H19 (H19</i>) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with <i>H19</i> expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that <i>H19</i> induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that <i>H19</i> silenced <i>NOTCH1</i> by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of <i>H19</i> in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> and decreased the level of <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>, 2 downstream targets repressed by <i>NOTCH1</i>. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented <i>H19</i>-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of <i>H19</i> during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of <i>NOTCH1.</i></p></sec>

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Clinical Usefulness, Angiographic Characteristics, and Safety Evaluation of Intracoronary Acetylcholine Provocation Testing Among 921 Consecutive White Patients With Unobstructed Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Coronary spasm can cause myocardial ischemia and angina in patients with and those without obstructive coronary artery disease. However, provocation tests using intracoronary acetylcholine administration are rarely performed in clinical routine in the United States and Europe. Thus, we assessed the clinical usefulness, angiographic characteristics, and safety of intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From September 2007 to June 2010, a total of 921 consecutive patients (362 men, mean age 62±12years) who underwent diagnostic angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries (no stenosis ≥50%) were enrolled. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing was performed directly after angiography according to a standardized protocol. Three hundred forty-six patients (35%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed chest pain at rest, 222 (22%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed chest pain on exertion, 238 (24%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed a combination of effort and resting chest pain, and 41 (4%) presented with troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome. The overall frequency of epicardial spasm (>75% diameter reduction with angina and ischemic ECG shifts) was 33.4%, and the overall frequency of microvascular spasm (angina and ischemic ECG shifts without epicardial spasm) was 24.2%. Epicardial spasm was most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments (<i>P</i><0.01). No fatal or irreversible nonfatal complications occurred. However, 9 patients (1%) had minor complications (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [n=1], fast paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [n=1], symptomatic bradycardia [n=6], and catheter-induced spasm [n=1]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Epicardial and microvascular spasm are frequently found in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries. Epicardial spasm is most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation test is a safe technique to assess coronary vasomotor function.</p></sec>

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote re-entrant arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> algorithms at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with <i>SCN10A</i> and <i>SCN5A</i> variants. <i>SCN10A</i> variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5272 “heart-healthy” study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants. The phenome-wide association study approach implicated sodium channel variants modulating QRS duration in subjects without cardiac disease as predictors of subsequent arrhythmias.</p></sec>

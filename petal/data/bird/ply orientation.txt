PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in leaf cells.</p>

Variation in functional pelvic tilt in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pelvis rotates in the sagittal plane during daily activities.

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p>Female insects of diverse orders bore into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong> their eggs. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>, which include the selection of suitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es through which the ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>or can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>or within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>or to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>or tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>or tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e boring and analyse buckling of the ovi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>or to estimate the forces required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es.</p>

Role of En2 in the tectal laminar formation of chick embryos
<p>The chick optic tectum consists of 16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ae. Here, we report contribution of En2 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ar formation in chick optic tecta. En2 is specifically expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ae g-j of stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale (SGFS). Misexpression of En2 resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ae a-f of SGFS), where endogenous En2 is not expressed. Misexpression of En2 before postmitotic cells had left the ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> indicated that En2-misexpressing cells stopped at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ae of endogenous En2 expression and that they did not migrate into the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s. Induction of En2 misexpression using a tetracycline-inducible system after the postmitotic cells had reached superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s also resulted in disappearance of En2-expressing cells from the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s. Time-lapse analysis showed that En2-misexpressing cells migrated back from the superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s towards the middle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s, where En2 is strongly expressed endogenously. Our results suggest a potential role of En2 in regulating cell migration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in the tectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ar formation.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-binding domain (SBD) connected by a linker that couples the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the release of the protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP binding to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP binding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric connection between nucleotide binding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus mal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment   leading to increased medial force ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced.

The kinases HipA and HipA7 phosphorylate different substrate pools in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to promote multidrug tolerance
<p>The bacterial serine-threonine protein kinase HipA promotes multidrug tolerance by phosphorylating the glutamate-tRNA ligase (GltX), leading to a halt in translation, inhibition of growth, and induction of a physiologically dormant state (persistence). The HipA variant HipA7 substantially increases persistence despite being less efficient at inhibiting cell growth. We postulated that this phenotypic difference was caused by differences in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es targeted by both kinases. We overproduced HipA and HipA7 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and identified their endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es by SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics. We confirmed that GltX was the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e of both kinase variants and likely the primary determinant of persistence. When HipA and HipA7 were moderately overproduced from plasmids, HipA7 targeted only GltX, but HipA phosphorylated several additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es involved in translation, transcription, and replication, such as ribosomal protein L11 (RplK) and the negative modulator of replication initiation, SeqA. HipA7 showed reduced kinase activity compared to HipA and targeted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e pool similar to that of HipA only when produced from a high–copy number plasmid. The kinase variants also differed in autophosphorylation, which was substantially reduced for HipA7. When produced endogenously from the chromosome, HipA showed no activity because of inhibition by the antitoxin HipB, whereas HipA7 phosphorylated GltX and phage shock protein PspA. Initial testing did not reveal a connection between HipA-induced phosphorylation of RplK and persistence or growth inhibition, suggesting that other HipA-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es were likely responsible for growth inhibition. Our results contribute to the understanding of HipA7 action and present a resource for elucidating HipA-related persistence.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and in more distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Mechanism of allosteric modulation of P-glycoprotein by transport substrates and inhibitors
<p>The ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein plays a central role in clearance of xenobiotics in humans and is implicated in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. We used double electron electron resonance spectroscopy to uncover the basis of stimulation of P-glycoprotein adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis by multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es and illuminate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es and inhibitors differentially affect its transport function. Our results reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites. By contrast, this state is destabilized in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-free cycle and by high-affinity inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites. Together with previous data, our findings lead to a general model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e and inhibitor coupling to P-glycoprotein.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ed onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations of the spin-coated films are determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e. The thin stagnant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion ad<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong> water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome structures reveal mechanisms for ATP-hydrolysis–driven translocation
<p>The 26<i>S</i> proteasome is the primary eukaryotic degradation machine and thus is critically involved in numerous cellular processes. The heterohexameric adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) motor of the proteasome unfolds and translocates targeted protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es into the open gate of a proteolytic core while a proteasomal deubiquitinase concomitantly removes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-attached ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanisms by which ATP hydrolysis drives the conformational changes responsible for these processes have remained elusive. Here we present the cryo–electron microscopy structures of four distinct conformational states of the actively ATP-hydrolyzing, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome. These structures reveal how mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e translocation accelerates deubiquitination and how ATP-binding, -hydrolysis, and phosphate-release events are coordinated within the AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) motor to induce conformational changes and propel the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e through the central pore.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Structure of the mitochondrial inner membrane AAA+ protease YME1 gives insight into substrate processing
<p>We present an atomic model of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-bound inner mitochondrial membrane AAA+ quality control protease in yeast, YME1. Our ~3.4-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure reveals how the adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) form a closed spiral staircase encircling an unfolded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e, directing it toward the flat, symmetric protease ring. Three coexisting nucleotide states allosterically induce distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of tyrosines in the central channel, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e engagement and translocation to the negatively charged proteolytic chamber. This tight coordination by a network of conserved residues defines a sequential, around-the-ring adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis cycle that results in stepwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e translocation. A hingelike linker accommodates the large-scale nucleotide-driven motions of the ATPase spiral relative to the planar proteolytic base. The translocation mechanism is likely conserved for other AAA+ ATPases.</p>

Ratchet-like polypeptide translocation mechanism of the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104
<p>Hsp100 polypeptide translocases are conserved members of the AAA+ family (adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities) that maintain proteostasis by unfolding aberrant and toxic proteins for refolding or proteolytic degradation. The Hsp104 disaggregase from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> solubilizes stress-induced amorphous aggregates and amyloids. The structural basis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e recognition and translocation is unknown. Using a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e (casein), we report cryo–electron microscopy structures at near-atomic resolution of Hsp104 in different translocation states. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e interactions are mediated by conserved, pore-loop tyrosines that contact an 80-angstrom-long unfolded polypeptide along the axial channel. Two protomers undergo a ratchet-like conformational change that advances pore loop–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e interactions by two amino acids. These changes are coupled to activation of specific nucleotide hydrolysis sites and, when transmitted around the hexamer, reveal a processive rotary translocation mechanism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-responsive flexibility during Hsp104-catalyzed disaggregation.</p>

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing antiferromagnets with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded ferromagnetism of the magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an antiferromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interlay</span></strong>er exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but ferromagnetic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer.

The magnetization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature.

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e proteins modulates their turnover, activity, or interaction partners. However, how this SUMO conjugation activity concentrates the proteins involved and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the requirements for SUMO NB formation and for their subsequent colocalization with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a master regulator of plant growth. COP1 activity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation activity alone was sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO conjugation activity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 docks in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e-binding pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO conjugation activity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation stimulates COP1 activity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es are sumoylated.</p>

Temporal Proteomics of Inducible RNAi Lines of Clp Protease Subunits Identifies Putative Protease Substrates
<p>The Clp protease in the chloroplasts of plant cells is a large complex composed of at least 13 nucleus-encoded subunits and one plastid-encoded subunit, which are arranged in several ring-like structures. The proteolytic P-ring and the structurally similar R-ring form the core complex that contains the proteolytic chamber. Chaperones of the HSP100 family help with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e unfolding, and additional accessory proteins are believed to assist with Clp complex assembly and/or to promote complex stability. Although the structure and function of the Clp protease have been studied in great detail in both bacteria and chloroplasts, the identification of bona fide protease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es has been very challenging. Knockout mutants of genes for protease subunits are of limited value, due to their often pleiotropic phenotypes and the difficulties with distinguishing primary effects (i.e. overaccumulation of proteins that represent genuine protease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es) from secondary effects (proteins overaccumulating for other reasons). Here, we have developed a new strategy for the identification of candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es of plant proteases. By combining ethanol-inducible knockdown of protease subunits with time-resolved analysis of changes in the proteome, proteins that respond immediately to reduced protease activity can be identified. In this way, secondary effects are minimized and putative protease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es can be identified. We have applied this strategy to the Clp protease complex of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and identified a set of chloroplast proteins that are likely degraded by Clp. These include several metabolic enzymes but also a small number of proteins involved in photosynthesis.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue organization and pattern formation within a multicellular organism rely on coordinated cell division and cell-fate determination. In animals, cell fates are mainly determined by a cell lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ional information is thought to be the primary determinant of cell fates. However, our understanding of cell-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the histological and anatomical studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> of each cell type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic cell-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that cell-fate determination in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern formation. The inherited cell identity can subsequently be removed or modified by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ional information. The instruction of cell-fate conversion is not a fast readout during root development. The final identity of a cell type is determined by the synergistic contribution from multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s of regulation, including symplastic communication across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during cell-fate instruction.</p>

Characterization of Trichome-Expressed BAHD Acyltransferases in <i>Petunia axillaris</i> Reveals Distinct Acylsugar Assembly Mechanisms within the Solanaceae
<p>Acylsugars are synthesized in the glandular trichomes of the Solanaceae family and are implicated in protection against abiotic and biotic stress. Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), acylsugar assembly requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3′, and R2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. <i>Petunia</i> spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a <i>Petunia</i> <i>axillaris</i> transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses coupled with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar assembly is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In <i>P. axillaris</i>, tetra-acylsucrose assembly occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions. Notably, in <i>P. axillaris</i>, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion in tomato, is absent in <i>P. axillaris</i>. Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays. Overall, these data demonstrate the considerable evolutionary plasticity of acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the crystal structures of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our structural and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the coiled-coil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ed near the entrance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e delivery.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e was available and fatty acid was the dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I/IgA Immune Complexes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and gestational morbidity in patients with antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs). Predictive value of the presence of aPLs is low, and new markers are necessary to identify aPL carriers at higher risk and take preventive measures on them. The presence of circulating immune complexes of IgA bound to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (B2A-CIC) has been associated with occurrence of acute thrombotic events. In this work we study its possible predictive value for the appearance of acute thrombotic events in patients who are going to undergo transplant surgery, a well-known trigger of acute thrombotic events in aPL carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a follow-up study based on the Magnum 12+12 Cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant (n=1339). Three groups were established: group 1 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA anti-β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (aB2GP1) and B2A-CIC (n=125); group 2 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive only for IgA aB2GP1 (n=240); and control group, patients who were negative for IgA aB2GP1 (n=974). Levels of autoantibodies and B2A-CIC were quantified immediately before the transplant surgery and patients were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In group 1, 46.4% of patients experienced any type of thrombosis versus 10.4% in group 2 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 8.6% in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The incidence of graft thrombosis in group 1 (31.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in group 2 (3.3%, <i>P</i><0.001) and the control group (2.6%, <i>P</i><0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of B2A-CIC was an independent variable to experience any type of posttransplant thrombosis (hazard ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 4.81–9.37) and, prominently, for graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 14.75; 95% confidence interval, 9.11–23.89). No significant differences were found between B2A-CIC–negative and control group patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presence of B2A-CIC is a predictor of acute thrombotic events. Patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA aB2GP1 only are at risk of experiencing thrombosis if they are B2A-CIC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive. If they are B2A-CIC–negative patients, they have the same risk as the control group. Treatments to prevent acute thrombotic events should focus on B2A-CIC–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive patients.</p></sec>

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices
<p>Graphene is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>, resulting in a moiré superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s is a key tuning parameter of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interlay</span></strong>er coupling in thus-obtained twisted bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> graphene (TBG). We studied the propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway for controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>ed van der Waals materials, eliminating the need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin polarization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly magnetized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the magnetic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the op<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment of the magnetization. The interaction is not controlled by the magnetic field per se, but rather by the electron spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p>Magnetic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>ed metal halides promises varied magnetic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and ferromagnets, but device-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ed characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>ed magnetic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. We electrically detect the magnetic ground state and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interlay</span></strong>er coupling and observe a field-induced metamagnetic transition. The metamagnetic transition results in magnetoresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>, tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>, and tetra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively.

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter magnetic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> structures using four-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> antiferromagnetic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells
<p>The formation of a dense and uniform thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong> on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es is crucial for the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing formamidinium with multiple cations and mixed halide anions. The concentration of defect states, which reduce a cell’s performance by decreasing the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density, needs to be as low as possible. We show that the introduction of additional iodide ions into the organic cation solution, which are used to form the perovskite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s through an intramolecular exchanging process, decreases the concentration of deep-level defects. The defect-engineered thin perovskite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s enable the fabrication of PSCs with a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.1% in small cells and 19.7% in 1-square-centimeter cells.</p>

An N-end rule pathway that recognizes proline and destroys gluconeogenic enzymes
<p>Cells synthesize glucose if deprived of it, and destroy gluconeogenic enzymes upon return to glucose-replete conditions. We found that the Gid4 subunit of the ubiquitin ligase GID in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> targeted the gluconeogenic enzymes Fbp1, Icl1, and Mdh2 for degradation. Gid4 recognized the N-terminal proline (Pro) residue and the ~5-residue-long adjacent sequence motifs. Pck1, the fourth gluconeogenic enzyme, contains Pro at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 2; Gid4 directly or indirectly recognized Pro at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 2 of Pck1, contributing to its targeting. These and related results identified Gid4 as the recognition component of the GID-based proteolytic system termed the Pro/N-end rule pathway. Substrates of this pathway include gluconeogenic enzymes that bear either the N-terminal Pro residue or a Pro at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 2, together with adjacent sequence motifs.</p>

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats
<p>To navigate, animals need to represent not only their own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation, but also the location of their goal. Neural representations of an animal’s own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal direction. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal direction. The goal-direction and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-directed navigation.</p>

Histone Deacetylase Is Required for GA-Induced Programmed Cell Death in Maize Aleurone Layers
<p>Recent discoveries have shown that epigenetic regulation is an integral part of phytohormone-mediated processes. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) triggers a series of events in cereal aleurone cells that lead to programmed cell death (PCD), but the signaling cascade mediating GA-induced PCD in cereal aleurone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity gradually increased relative to histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, leading to a global decrease in histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels during PCD of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) embryoless aleurone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s after 3 d of treatment with GA. HDAC inhibition prevented GA-induced PCD in embryoless aleurone cells, whereas HAT inhibition resulted in PCD even in the absence of GA. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations increased in GA- or HAT inhibitor-treated aleurone cells due to reduced levels of reactive oxygen species scavengers. Hydrogen peroxide-treated aleurone cells showed no changes in the activity or expression of HATs and HDACs. We show that it is possible to predict whether epigenetic modification enzymes serve as a regulator of the GA-triggered PCD signaling pathway in maize aleurone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s. Taken together, these findings reveal that HDAC activity is required for GA-induced PCD in maize aleurone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">layer</span></strong>s and regulates PCD via the reactive oxygen species-mediated signal transduction pathway.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>es, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substrat</span></strong>e supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection for either an increase or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

The unsuspected prosthetic joint infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive cultures are not uncommon in cases of revision total   knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA and THA) for presumed aseptic causes.   The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive   intra-operative cultures in presumed aseptic revision of TKA and   THA, and to determine whether the presence of intra-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive cultures   results in inferior survival in such cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective cohort study was assembled with 679 patients   undergoing revision knee (340 cases) or hip arthroplasty (339 cases)   for presumed aseptic causes. For all patients three or more separate   intra-operative cultures were obtained. Patients were diagnosed   with a previously unsuspected prosthetic joint infection (PJI) if two   or more cultures were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive with the same organism. Records were   reviewed for demographic details, pre-operative laboratory results   and culture results. The primary outcome measure was infection-free   implant survival at two years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The incidence of unsuspected PJI was 27 out of 340 (7.9%) in   TKA and 41 out of 339 (12.1%) in THA. Following revision TKA, the   rate of infection-free implant survival in patients with an unsuspected   PJI was 88% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 60 to 97) at two years   compared with 98% (95% CI 94 to 99) in patients without PJI (p = 0.001).   After THA, the rate of survival was similar in those with unsuspected   PJI (92% (95% CI 73 to 98) at two years) and those without (94%   (95% CI 89 to 97), p = 0.31).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Following revision of TKA and THA for aseptic diagnoses, around   10% of cases were found to have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive cultures. In the knee,   such cases had inferior infection-free survival at two years compared   with those with negative cultures; there was no difference between   the groups following THA.</p><p>Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:1482–9.</p></sec>

Comparison of the outcome of total ankle arthroplasty for osteoarthritis with moderate and severe varus malalignment and that with neutral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic   outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in patients with pre-operatively   moderate and severe arthritic varus ankles to those achieved for   patients with neutral ankles.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 105 patients (105 ankles), matched for age, gender,   body mass index, and follow-up duration, were divided into three   groups by pre-operative coronal plane tibiotalar angle; neutral   (< 5°), moderate (5° to 15°) and severe (> 15°) varus deformity.   American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot   score, a visual analogue scale (VAS), and Short Form (SF)-36 score   were used to compare the clinical outcomes after a mean follow-up period   of 51 months (24 to 147).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The post-operative AOFAS, VAS scores, range of movement and complication   rates did not significantly differ among three groups. However,   there was less improvement in the SF-36 score of the severe varus   group (p = 0.008). The mean post-operative tibiotalar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment   was 2.6° (0.1° to 8.9°), 3.1° (0.1° to 6.5°) and 4.6° (1.0° to 10.6°)   in the neutral, moderate and severe groups respectively. Although   the severe varus group showed less corrected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment than the   neutral group, the mean tibiotalar angles of the three groups were   within neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TAA for moderate and severe varus arthritic deformity showed   similar satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes as those   obtained by patients in the neutral group when post-operative neutral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment was achieved.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1335–42.</p></sec>

Appropriate hinge position for prevention of unstable lateral hinge fracture in open wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Open wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) for medial-compartment   osteoarthritis of the knee can be complicated by intra-operative   lateral hinge fracture (LHF). We aimed to establish the relationship   between hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and fracture types, and suggest an appropriate   hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion to reduce the risk of this complication.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Consecutive patients undergoing OWHTO were evaluated on coronal   multiplanar reconstruction CT images. Hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions were divided   into five zones in our new classification, by their relationship   to the proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ). Fractures were classified   into types I, II, and III according to the Takeuchi classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among 111 patients undergoing OWHTOs, 22 sustained lateral hinge   fractures. Of the 89 patients without fractures, 70 had hinges in   the zone within the PTFJ and lateral to the medial margin of the   PTFJ (zone WL), just above the PTFJ. Among the five zones, the relative   risk of unstable fracture was significantly lower in zone WL (relative   risk 0.24, confidence interval 0.17 to 0.34).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Zone WL appears to offer the safest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion for the placement   of the osteotomy hinge when trying to avoid a fracture at the osteotomy   site.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99B10:1313–18</p></sec>

Measuring the migration of the components and polyethylene wear after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the components and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation reflect   the migration of the components and the penetration of the femoral   head. Validation was performed using radiographs of phantoms simulating   known migration and penetration, and the clinical feasibility of   measuring migration was assessed in two patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the acetabular and femoral components can be measured   with limits of agreement (LOA) of 0.37 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively.   Penetration of the femoral head can be measured with LOA of 0.161   mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The migration of components and polyethylene wear can be measured   without needing specialised radiographs. Accurate measurement may   allow earlier prediction of failure after THA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1290–7.</p></sec>

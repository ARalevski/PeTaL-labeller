Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery. This laboratory   study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic antibacterial   properties against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plankton</span></strong>ic bacteria, or the ability to inhibit   biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components   were sterilised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either <i>Staphylococcus   (S.) aureus</i> or <i>S. epidermidis</i> for 24 hours.   After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified   on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. In order to establish whether biofilms   formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these   Ta and Ti pieces were then washed twice, sonicated and washed again   to remove loosely adhered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plankton</span></strong>ic bacteria. They were then re-incubated   for 24 hours prior to quantifying the number of cfu. All experiments   were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>More than 1x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml were observed in both the Ta   and Ti experiments. After washing and sonication, more than 2x10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml   were observed for both Ta and Ti groups. The results were the same   for both <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with Ti controls, Ta did not demonstrate any intrinsic   antibacterial activity or ability to inhibit biofilm formation.   Hence, intrinsic antimicrobial properties of Ta do not account for   the previously observed reduction in the frequency of subsequent   infections when Ta was used in revision procedures. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1153–6.</p></sec>

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean
<p>Rising oceanic and atmospheric oxygen levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth environments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the oxygenation of the upper ocean to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plankton</span></strong>, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago.</p>

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef
<p>With the rapid rise in pollution-associated nitrogen inputs to the western Pacific, it has been suggested that even the open ocean has been affected. In a coral core from Dongsha Atoll, a remote coral reef ecosystem, we observe a decline in the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N of coral skeleton–bound organic matter, which signals increased deposition of anthropogenic atmospheric N on the open ocean and its incorporation into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plankton</span></strong> and, in turn, the atoll corals. The first clear change occurred just before 2000 CE, decades later than predicted by other work. The amplitude of change suggests that, by 2010, anthropogenic atmospheric N deposition represented 20 ± 5% of the annual N input to the surface ocean in this region, which appears to be at the lower end of other estimates.</p>

Using a shell as a wing: pairing of dissimilar appendages in atlantiid heteropod swimming
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Atlantiid heteropod swimming is unique in that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plankton</span></strong>ic snails use a swimming fin and shell as paired wings to execute complex appendage kinematics, including a double clap-and-fling.</p>

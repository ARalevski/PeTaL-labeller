β-Arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling promotes extinction learning of cocaine reward memory
<p>Extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated contextual cues can help prevent cocaine addicts from relapsing. Pharmacological manipulation of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) during extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing is being developed as a potential strategy to treat drug addiction. We demonstrated that the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated memory was mediated by β-arrestin2–biased but not heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–dependent β-adrenergic signaling. We found that administration of the nonbiased β-AR antagonist propranolol, but not the G protein–biased β-AR antagonist carvedilol, blocked extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference and the associated ERK activation in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Overexpression of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex promoted extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, which was blocked by propranolol. Knockout of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, specifically in excitatory neurons, impaired extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference, which was not rescued by carvedilol. β-Arrestin2 signaling in infralimbic excitatory neurons was also required for the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing in the cocaine self-administration model. Our results suggest that β-arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex regulates extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated memories and could be therapeutically targeted to treat addiction.</p>

Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] ≥135/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥130/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥120/70 mm Hg) have been derived from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome.

Mind the gap: Neural coding of species identity in birdsong prosody
<p>Juvenile songbirds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> vocal communication from adult tutors of the same species but not from adults of other species. How species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal gaps between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology. Behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps. During the vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing period, temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song.

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other compounds had higher deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

Insular cortex processes aversive somatosensory information and is crucial for threat learning
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about threats is essential for survival. During threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, an innocuous sensory percept such as a tone acquires an emotional meaning when paired with an aversive stimulus such as a mild footshock. The amygdala is critical for threat memory formation, but little is known about upstream brain areas that process aversive somatosensory information. Using optogenetic techniques in mice, we found that silencing of the posterior insula during footshock reduced acute fear behavior and impaired 1-day threat memory. Insular cortex neurons respond to footshocks, acquire responses to tones during threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, and project to distinct amygdala divisions to drive acute fear versus threat memory formation. Thus, the posterior insula conveys aversive footshock information to the amygdala and is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about potential dangers in the environment.</p>

Human-level performance in 3D multiplayer games with population-based reinforcement learning

However, the real world contains multiple agents, each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents. We used a tournament-style evaluation to demonstrate that an agent can achieve human-level performance in a three-dimensional multiplayer first-person video game, <i>Quake III Arena</i> in Capture the Flag mode, using only pixels and game points scored as input. We used a two-tier optimization process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches on randomly generated environments.

Epigenetics and the evolution of instincts

Little is known about how animals acquire the instincts that enable such innate behavior. Instincts are widely held to be ancestral to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed behavior. Some have been elegantly analyzed at the cellular and molecular levels, but general principles do not exist. Based on recent research, we argue instead that instincts evolve from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and are therefore served by the same general principles that explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing.</p>

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress
<p>More than a decade of research has supported a robust consensus: Acute stress impairs memory retrieval. We aimed to determine whether a highly effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing technique could strengthen memory against the negative effects of stress. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced stress in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by restudying demonstrated the typical stress-related memory impairment, whereas those who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious effects of stress. These results suggest that the effects of stress on memory retrieval may be contingent on the strength of the memory representations themselves.</p>

The acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1a mediates striatal synapse remodeling and procedural motor learning
<p>Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is abundant in multiple brain regions, including the striatum, which serves as the input nucleus of the basal ganglia and is critically involved in procedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and motor memory. We investigated the functional role of ASIC1a in striatal neurons. We found that ASIC1a was critical for striatum-dependent motor coordination and procedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing by regulating the synaptic plasticity of striatal medium spiny neurons. Global deletion of <i>Asic1a</i> in mice led to increased dendritic spine density but impaired spine morphology and postsynaptic architecture, which were accompanied by the decreased function of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors at excitatory synapses. These structural and functional changes caused by the loss of ASIC1a were largely mediated by reduced activation (phosphorylation) of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular signal–regulated protein kinases (ERKs). Consequently, <i>Asic1a</i> null mice exhibited poor performance on multiple motor tasks, which was rescued by striatal-specific expression of either ASIC1a or CaMKII. Together, our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism mediated by ASIC1a that promotes the excitatory synaptic function underlying striatum-related procedural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory.</p>

Learning-dependent chromatin remodeling highlights noncoding regulatory regions linked to autism
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions—most of which were promoters. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing-regulated promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (<i>SHANK3</i> promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data support the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing recapitulates development at the epigenetic level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.</p>

Dynamic salience processing in paraventricular thalamus gates associative learning
<p>The salience of behaviorally relevant stimuli is dynamic and influenced by internal state and external environment. Monitoring such changes is critical for effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and flexible behavior, but the neuronal substrate for tracking the dynamics of stimulus salience is obscure. We found that neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are robustly activated by a variety of behaviorally relevant events, including novel (“unfamiliar”) stimuli, reinforcing stimuli and their predicting cues, as well as omission of the expected reward. PVT responses are scaled with stimulus intensity and modulated by changes in homeostatic state or behavioral context. Inhibition of the PVT responses suppresses appetitive or aversive associative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and reward extinction. Our findings demonstrate that the PVT gates associative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing by providing a dynamic representation of stimulus salience.</p>

Neural scene representation and rendering

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and recollection: The process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our memories. It has been widely accepted that memories are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of neurons, where presumably one neuron is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting neuron and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected neurons become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “neurons wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an ability to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected neurons—in order to form memories and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected neurons significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing mechanism called behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected neurons may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex

However, it remains elusive whether and how object percepts alone, or concomitantly a nonphysical attribute of the objects (“<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed”), are decoded from perirhinal activities. By combining monkey psychophysics with optogenetic and electrical stimulations, we found a focal spot of memory neurons where both stimulations led monkeys to preferentially judge presented objects as “already seen.” In an adjacent fringe area, where neurons did not exhibit selective responses to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed objects, electrical stimulation induced the opposite behavioral bias toward “never seen before,” whereas optogenetic stimulation still induced bias toward “already seen.” These results suggest that mnemonic judgment of objects emerges via the decoding of their nonphysical attributes encoded by perirhinal neurons.</p>

Scaling pain threshold with microRNAs
<p>Pain is not something universally enjoyed, especially chronic pain involving nerve damage, referred to as neuropathic pain (<i>1</i>).

The study provides important new insights into molecular mechanisms that control pain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>, both in normal and pathological conditions.</p>

<p>Machine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed through trial and error by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed for reward and are instead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?
<p>Animals use the neurotransmitter dopamine to encode the relationship between their responses and reward. Reinforcement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing theory (<i>1</i>) successfully explains the role of phasic bursts of dopamine in terms of future reward maximization. Yet, dopamine clearly plays other roles in shaping behavior that have no obvious relationship to reinforcement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, including modulating the rate at which our subjective sense of time grows in real time. On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of dopamine in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of dopamine function in timing—the dopamine clock hypothesis (<i>3</i>). They may also help explain empirical phenomena that challenge the reinforcement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing account of dopamine function.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB measure of both sound pressure (sound pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

Hearing threshold shifts and recovery after noise exposure in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>Temporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> shift (TTS) after loud noise exposure was investigated in a male and a female beluga whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s were evaluated using the evoked-potential technique, which allowed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> tracing with a resolution of ~1 min. The fatiguing noise had a 0.5 octave bandwidth, with center frequencies ranging from 11.2 to 90 kHz, a level of 165 dB re. 1 μPa and exposure durations from 1 to 30 min. The effects of the noise were tested at probe frequencies ranging from −0.5 to +1.5 octaves relative to the noise center frequency. The effect was estimated in terms of both immediate (1.5 min) post-exposure TTS and recovery duration. The highest TTS with the longest recovery duration was produced by noises of lower frequencies (11.2 and 22.5 kHz) and appeared at a test frequency of +0.5 octave. At higher noise frequencies (45 and 90 kHz), the TTS decreased. The TTS effect gradually increased with prolonged exposures ranging from 1 to 30 min. There was a considerable TTS difference between the two subjects.</p>

Ultrafast neuronal imaging of dopamine dynamics with designed genetically encoded sensors
<p>Neuromodulatory systems exert profound influences on brain function. Understanding how these systems modify the operating mode of target circuits requires spatiotemporally precise measurement of neuromodulator release. We developed dLight1, an intensity-based genetically encoded dopamine indicator, to enable optical recording of dopamine dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution in behaving mice. We demonstrated the utility of dLight1 by imaging dopamine dynamics simultaneously with pharmacological manipulation, electrophysiological or optogenetic stimulation, and calcium imaging of local neuronal activity. dLight1 enabled chronic tracking of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing-induced changes in millisecond dopamine transients in mouse striatum. Further, we used dLight1 to image spatially distinct, functionally heterogeneous dopamine transients relevant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and motor control in mouse cortex. We also validated our sensor design platform for developing norepinephrine, serotonin, melatonin, and opioid neuropeptide indicators.</p>

Predicting reaction performance in C–N cross-coupling using machine learning
<p>Machine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing methods are becoming integral to scientific inquiry in numerous disciplines. We demonstrated that machine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing can be used to predict the performance of a synthetic reaction in multidimensional chemical space using data obtained via high-throughput experimentation. We created scripts to compute and extract atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors for the components of a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling of aryl halides with 4-methylaniline in the presence of various potentially inhibitory additives. Using these descriptors as inputs and reaction yield as output, we showed that a random forest algorithm provides significantly improved predictive performance over linear regression analysis. The random forest model was also successfully applied to sparse training sets and out-of-sample prediction, suggesting its value in facilitating adoption of synthetic methodology.</p>

Evidence for a neural law of effect
<p>Thorndike’s law of effect states that actions that lead to reinforcements tend to be repeated more often. Accordingly, neural activity patterns leading to reinforcement are also reentered more frequently. Reinforcement relies on dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and animals shape their behavior to receive dopaminergic stimulation. Seeking evidence for a neural law of effect, we found that mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity patterns that trigger optogenetic VTA self-stimulation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing was accompanied by gradual shaping of these patterns, with participating neurons progressively increasing and aligning their covariance to that of the target pattern. Motor cortex patterns that lead to phasic dopaminergic VTA activity are progressively reinforced and shaped, suggesting a mechanism by which animals select and shape actions to reliably achieve reinforcement.</p>

A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs

The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence.</p>

DeepStack: Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker

Bumblebees show cognitive flexibility by improving on an observed complex behavior
<p>We explored bees’ behavioral flexibility in a task that required transporting a small ball to a defined location to gain a reward. Bees were pretrained to know the correct location of the ball. Subsequently, to obtain a reward, bees had to move a displaced ball to the defined location. Bees that observed demonstration of the technique from a live or model demonstrator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed the task more efficiently than did bees observing a “ghost” demonstration (ball moved via magnet) or without demonstration. Instead of copying demonstrators moving balls over long distances, observers solved the task more efficiently, using the ball positioned closest to the target, even if it was of a different color than the one previously observed. Such unprecedented cognitive flexibility hints that entirely novel behaviors could emerge relatively swiftly in species whose lifestyle demands advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing abilities, should relevant ecological pressures arise.</p>

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle
<p>It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 synapses in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses (~80%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.</p>

RNA interference with <i>FoxP</i> expression in αβ core Kenyon cells, or the overexpression of a potassium conductance in these neurons, recapitulated the <i>FoxP</i> mutant phenotype. A mushroom body subdomain whose development or function require the transcription factor FoxP thus supports the progression of a decision toward commitment.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain circuits adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure
<p>We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> to determine whether the adults discriminate among common sugars, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single sugar solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concentrations of 0.008–2.0 mol l<sup>−1</sup>, the estimated concentrations at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l<sup>−1</sup> for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other sugars, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other sugars tested. The higher acceptance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor nutritional quality of the sugar in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding inhibition seen for fructose following exposure to other sugars is not linked with lower nutritional performance. This feeding inhibition was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest acceptance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> (0.031 mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and persisted for 24 h. This study is the first to show feeding inhibition of otherwise phagostimulant sugars such as maltose and fructose after gustatory stimulation on other sugars.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>t odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ability across odour intensities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate intensity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain.</p>

The direct anterior approach in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The most effective surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty   (THA) remains controversial. The direct anterior approach may be   associated with a reduced risk of dislocation, faster recovery,   reduced pain and fewer surgical complications. This systematic review   aims to evaluate the current evidence for the use of this approach   in THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Following the Cochrane collaboration, an extensive literature   search of PubMed, Medline, Embase and OvidSP was conducted. Randomised   controlled trials, comparative studies, and cohort studies were   included. Outcomes included the length of the incision, blood loss,   operating time, length of stay, complications, and gait analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were of   medium to low quality. There was no difference between the direct   anterior, anterolateral or posterior approaches with regards to   length of stay and gait analysis.</p><p>Papers comparing the length of the incision found similar lengths   compared with the lateral approach, and conflicting results when   comparing the direct anterior and posterior approaches. </p><p>Most studies found the mean operating time to be significantly   longer when the direct anterior approach was used, with a steep   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing curve reported by many.</p><p>Many authors used validated scores including the Harris hip score,   and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.   These mean scores were better following the use of the direct anterior   approach for the first six weeks post-operatively.

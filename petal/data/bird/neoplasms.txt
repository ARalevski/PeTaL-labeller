Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> are at risk of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this risk varies by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type, decade of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11). By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event. Beyond 60 years of age, every year, 0.4% of CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.1% expected), whereas at any age, every year, 0.2% of head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.06% expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Survivors of a CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, and leukemia are particularly at risk of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event. The excess risk of cerebral infarction among CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors increases with attained age. For head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors, this excess risk remains high across all ages. These groups of survivors, particularly males, should be considered for surveillance of cerebrovascular risk factors and potential pharmacological interventions for cerebral infarction prevention.</p></sec>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Cell Line Encyclopedia and The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> analysis to define the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressive in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Breast tumors educate the proteome of stromal tissue in an individualized but coordinated manner
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> forms specialized microenvironmental niches that promote local invasion and colonization. Engrafted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) locally invade and colonize naive stroma in mice while enabling unambiguous molecular discrimination of human proteins in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> from mouse proteins in the microenvironment. To characterize how patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s form a niche and educate naive stroma, subcutaneous breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> PDXs were globally profiled by species-specific quantitative proteomics. Regulation of PDX stromal proteins by breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s was extensive, with 35% of the stromal proteome altered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s consistently across different animals and passages. Differentially regulated proteins in the stroma clustered into six signatures, which included both known and previously unappreciated contributors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> invasion and colonization. Stromal proteomes were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of proteins altered by each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and stromal proteins, a comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known hallmarks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining the microenvironmental niche of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. Education of the stroma by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> is therefore an intrinsic property of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s that is highly individualized, yet proceeds by consistent, nonrandom, and defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-promoting molecular alterations.</p>

Tumor metastasis to lymph nodes requires YAP-dependent metabolic adaptation
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> LN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s in mice, we found that LN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s requires that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, leading to the up-regulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s to LNs.</p>

The lncRNA H19 mediates breast cancer cell plasticity during EMT and MET plasticity by differentially sponging miR-200b/c and let-7b
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s is a multistep process by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells disseminate from their primary site and form secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s at a distant site. The pathophysiological course of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets <i>Git2</i> and <i>Cyth3</i>, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its axis prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s.</p>

Loss of SPDEF and gain of TGFBI activity after androgen deprivation therapy promote EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer
<p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the androgen receptor (AR) is a standard therapeutic regimen for treating prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> after ADT. We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen–binding protein transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ)–induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. In prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of <i>TGFBI</i>. ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and brain and bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s in xenograft models, extending the survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s and can be caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased protein translation in cells and various factors in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow–derived myeloid cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that facilitates pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic characteristics in culture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in vivo. We investigated whether this intercellular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and what its functional consequences were within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that included the cell surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of cell survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells gave rise to faster growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s than did vehicle-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of intercellular communication through which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

Potassium shapes antitumor immunity
<p>T cells protect us from infections and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Nonetheless, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s grow, persist, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>ze, even in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which include T cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell–killing capabilities. This lack of immune control stems from the functional exhaustion, or hyporesponsiveness, of TILs as a consequence of chronic antigen exposure, poor expression of rejection antigens by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, hypoxia, lack of nutrients or substrates, and/or other suppressive mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment (TME). Despite these challenges, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigen–specific TILs with stem cell–like behavior can mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> destruction after successful immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade (<i>1</i>). Finding mechanisms that maintain the stemness of TILs may lead to improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapies. On page 1417 of this issue, Vodnala <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify the concentration of extracellular potassium in the TME as a determinant of the dysfunction and stemness of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs. This helps explain how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress in the presence of T cells that could clear them and suggests new approaches to boost T cell stemness in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapy.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, genetic errors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes have provided clues about the different ways that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can manifest as a disease of genetic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carcinogen</span></strong>s (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils

Bone voyage—Osteoblasts remotely control tumors
<p>Cancer is a systemic disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and malignant progression rely not only on the intrinsic aberrant genetic and epigenetic makeup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells but also on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-induced systemic factors that affect cells in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> as well as distant microenvironments (<i>1</i>). Notably, bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been shown to contribute to primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression by promoting hallmark processes such as inflammation, immunosuppression, vasculogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. BMDCs are also involved in establishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-permissive microenvironments that form before the arrival of disseminated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells at future metastatic sites (known as premetastatic niches) and promote metastatic outgrowth (<i>2</i>–<i>5</i>). In addition to the direct effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-secreted factors on BMDC recruitment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, on page eaal5081 of this issue Engblom <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) report that osteoblasts, which reside in the bone, can be remotely activated by secreted factors from lung adenocarcinoma, which in turn mobilize a specific subset of BMDCs—neutrophils—to foster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth.</p>

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more interferon-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and improved long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free survival in the mouse cohort. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>) cells.

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells and immunosuppressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s positive for TNFR2.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s reprogram cellular metabolism to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell proliferation and survival. Although most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine metabolism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote glutamine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression positively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunity by inhibiting the killing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>al T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

The transcription factor MAFK induces EMT and malignant progression of triple-negative breast cancer cells through its target GPNMB
<p>Triple-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. For example, the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pathway is implicated in TNBC progression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s, but its opposing role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppression in healthy tissues and early-stage lesions makes it a challenging target. Therefore, additional molecular characterization of TNBC may lead to improved patient prognosis by informing the development and optimum use of targeted therapies. We found that musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) oncogene family protein K (MAFK), a member of the small MAF family of transcription factors that are induced by the TGF-β pathway, was abundant in human TNBC and aggressive mouse mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell lines. MAFK promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s by 4T1 cells when implanted subcutaneously in mice. Overexpression of MAFK in mouse breast epithelial NMuMG cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation and invasion in mice. MAFK induced the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB). Similar to MAFK, GPNMB overexpression in NMuMG cells induced EMT, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation, and invasion, in mice, whereas knockdown of MAFK in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells before implantation suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and progression. <i>MAFK</i> and <i>GPNMB</i> expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. These findings suggest that MAFK and its target gene <i>GPNMB</i> play important roles in the malignant progression of TNBC cells, offering potentially new therapeutic targets for TNBC patients.</p>

The linker histone H1.0 generates epigenetic and functional intratumor heterogeneity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s comprise functionally diverse subpopulations of cells with distinct proliferative potential.

Numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types exhibit high inter- and intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> heterogeneity of H1.0, with H1.0 levels correlating with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> differentiation status, patient survival, and, at the single-cell level, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> stem cell markers. Silencing of H1.0 promotes maintenance of self-renewing cells by inducing derepression of megabase-sized gene domains harboring downstream effectors of oncogenic pathways. Self-renewing epigenetic states are not stable, and reexpression of H1.0 in subsets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells establishes transcriptional programs that restrict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells’ long-term proliferative potential and drive their differentiation.

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced abundance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons sensitized nociceptive sensory neurons and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the abundance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-bearing rats rescued TRESK abundance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK abundance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s–associated pain in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP inhibitors to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP inhibitor olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP inhibitor combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP inhibitors.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression.</p>

Restoring tumor suppression

Much attention has focused on therapeutically inhibiting oncogenic kinases that are activated by mutation. However, there has been less focus on targeting phosphatases, despite their importance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> development. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is the most frequently inactivated phosphatase in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>).

NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination

<p>Immunotherapy has clinical activity in certain virally associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigens targeted in successful treatments remain poorly defined. We used a personalized immunogenomic approach to elucidate the global landscape of anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cell responses in complete regression of human papillomavirus–associated metastatic cervical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating adoptive T cell therapy. Remarkably, immunodominant T cell reactivities were directed against mutated neoantigens or a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> germline antigen, rather than canonical viral antigens. T cells targeting viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigens did not display preferential in vivo expansion. Both viral and nonviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigen–specific T cells resided predominantly in the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)–expressing T cell compartment, which suggests that PD-1 blockade may unleash diverse anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cell reactivities. These findings suggest a new paradigm of targeting nonviral antigens in immunotherapy of virally associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s.</p>

Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are caused by mutations that may be inherited, induced by environmental factors, or result from DNA replication errors (R). We studied the relationship between the number of normal stem cell divisions and the risk of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> incidence and normal stem cell divisions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the mutations in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of the fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that can be prevented by changes in the environment. Moreover, they accentuate the importance of early detection and intervention to reduce deaths from the many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s arising from unavoidable R mutations.</p>

<i>Rb1</i> and <i>Trp53</i> cooperate to suppress prostate cancer lineage plasticity, metastasis, and antiandrogen resistance
<p>Prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> relapsing from antiandrogen therapies can exhibit variant histology with altered lineage marker expression, suggesting that lineage plasticity facilitates therapeutic resistance. The mechanisms underlying prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> lineage plasticity are incompletely understood. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that <i>Rb1</i> loss facilitates lineage plasticity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s of prostate adenocarcinoma initiated by <i>Pten</i> mutation. Additional loss of <i>Trp53</i> causes resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Gene expression profiling indicates that mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s resemble human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> neuroendocrine variants; both mouse and human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s exhibit increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors such as Ezh2 and Sox2. Clinically relevant Ezh2 inhibitors restore androgen receptor expression and sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy. These findings uncover genetic mutations that enable prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> progression; identify mouse models for studying prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> lineage plasticity; and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending clinical responses to antiandrogen therapy.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p>Females of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s. The en<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>ed embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s while influencing their development and/or exit from females.</p>

Degenerative subtalar joints complicated by medial plantar intraneural cysts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s is controversial.   Recent reports in the literature described medial plantar intraneural   ganglion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s (mIGC) with articular branches to subtalar joints.   The aim of the current study was to provide further support for   the principles underlying the articular theory, and to explain the   successes and failures of treatment of mICGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2006 and 2017, five patients with five mICGs were retrospectively   reviewed. There were five men with a mean age of 50.2 years (33   to 68) and a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (0.8 to 6). Case history,   physical examination, imaging, and intraoperative findings were   reviewed. The outcomes of interest were ultrasound and/or MRI features   of mICG, as well as the clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five intraneural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s followed the principles of the unifying   articular theory. Connection to the posterior subtalar joint (pSTJ)   was identified or suspected in four patients. Re-evaluation of preoperative   MRI demonstrated a degenerative pSTJ and denervation changes in   the abductor hallucis in all patients. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong> excision with resection   of the articular branch (four), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong> incision and drainage (one),   and percutaneous aspiration/steroid injection (two) were performed.   Removing the connection to the pSTJ prevented recurrence of mIGC,   whereas medial plantar nerves remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>ic and symptomatic when   resection of the communicating articular branch was not performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings support a standardized treatment algorithm for mIGC   in the presence of degenerative disease at the pSTJ. By understanding   the pathoanatomic mechanism for every <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>, we can improve treatment   that must address the articular branch to avoid the recurrence of   intraneural ganglion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong>s, as well as the degenerative pSTJ to   avoid extraneural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyst</span></strong> formation or recurrence.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:183–9.</p></sec>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> in adult patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> in the population of adults with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for radiation surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative risks were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac disease. For all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s combined, the standardized mortality ratios for all cardiac diseases combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4–5.2) decreasing to 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 years (2<i>P</i> for trend <0.0001). Similar patterns were observed for both standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks for ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy.

TGF-β receptor I/II trafficking and signaling at primary cilia are inhibited by ceramide to attenuate cell migration and tumor metastasis
<p>Signaling by the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors I and II (TβRI/II) and the primary cilia-localized sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway promote cell migration and, consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s. In contrast, the sphingolipid ceramide inhibits cell proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s. We investigated whether ceramide metabolism inhibited TβRI/II trafficking to primary cilia to attenuate cross-talk between TβRI/II and the Shh pathway. We found that ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4)–generated ceramide stabilized the association between TβRI and the inhibitory factor Smad7, which limited the trafficking of TβRI/II to primary cilia. Expression of a mutant TβRI that signals but does not interact with Smad7 prevented the CerS4-mediated inhibition of migration in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Genetic deletion or knockdown of CerS4 prevented the formation of the Smad7-TβRI inhibitory complex and increased the association between TβRI and the transporter Arl6 through a previously unknown cilia-targeting signal (Ala<sup>31</sup>Thr<sup>32</sup>Ala<sup>33</sup>Leu<sup>34</sup>Gln<sup>35</sup>) in TβRI. Mutating the cilia-targeting signal abolished the trafficking of TβRI to the primary cilia. Localization of TβRI to primary cilia activated a key mediator of Shh signaling, Smoothened (Smo), which stimulated cellular migration and invasion. TβRI-Smo cross-talk at the cilia in CerS4-deficient 4T1 mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells induced liver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metastasi</span></strong>s from orthotopic allografts in both wild-type and CerS4-deficient mice, which was prevented by overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88). Overall, these data reveal a ceramide-dependent mechanism that suppresses cell migration and invasion by restricting TβRI/II-Shh signaling selectively at the plasma membrane of the primary cilium.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, PSMA-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA abundance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s.</p>

High-fructose corn syrup enhances intestinal tumor growth in mice
<p>Excessive consumption of beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is associated with obesity and with an increased risk of colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Whether HFCS contributes directly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis is unclear. We investigated the effects of daily oral administration of HFCS in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutant mice, which are predisposed to develop intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. The HFCS-treated mice showed a substantial increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> grade in the absence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. HFCS increased the concentrations of fructose and glucose in the intestinal lumen and serum, respectively, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s transported both sugars. Within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, fructose was converted to fructose-1-phosphate, leading to activation of glycolysis and increased synthesis of fatty acids that support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth. These mouse studies support the hypothesis that the combination of dietary glucose and fructose, even at a moderate dose, can enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis.</p>

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genetics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the genetic drivers for certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased genetic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. One of the most important observations from this work is that genetic alterations in bona fide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers (those genes that, when mutated, promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver genes appear only in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums. Here, we discuss the concept of tissue specificity of genetic alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and provide general hypotheses to help explain this biological phenomenon.</p>

The chromatin of cancer
<p>Developments in modern genomics tools have led to rapid progress in our understanding of the genetic basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Recent large-scale efforts have primarily focused on two types of analysis: mapping acquired somatic mutations by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>), and identification of common inherited variants that increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<i>3</i>). Despite the power of these technologies, we are still far from understanding how the variants and mutations found in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s precisely drive the oncogenic process. A large number of genetic variants increase risk for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, but most explain only a very small fraction of the risk. Furthermore, although acquired somatic mutations are found in almost all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, most do not carry complete sets of mutations that, according to our present mechanistic understanding, would be sufficient to cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. On page 420 of this issue, Corces <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how a third type of genomics approach—functional genomic analyses of primary human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s—can begin to bridge this gap in our mechanistic understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic process.</p>

Cancer detection: Seeking signals in blood
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are detected when they cause symptoms that lead to medical evaluation. Unfortunately, in too many cases this results in diagnosis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that are locally invasive or already metastatic and hence no longer curable with surgical resection or radiation treatment. Medical therapies, which might be curative in the setting of minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> burden, typically provide more limited benefit in more advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s, given the emergence of drug resistance (<i>1</i>).

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p>Mutational processes underlie <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes may explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Application of this strategy to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> mutations.</p>

Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade
<p>The genomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s deficient in mismatch repair contain exceptionally high numbers of somatic mutations. In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor–1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair–deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s across 12 different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair–deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s’ tissue of origin.</p>

Origins of lymphatic and distant metastases in human colorectal cancer
<p>The spread of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells from primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s to regional lymph nodes is often associated with reduced survival. One prevailing model to explain this association posits that fatal, distant metastases are seeded by lymph node metastases. This view provides a mechanistic basis for the TNM staging system and is the rationale for surgical resection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-draining lymph nodes. Here we examine the evolutionary relationship between primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, lymph node, and distant metastases in human colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Studying 213 archival biopsy samples from 17 patients, we used somatic variants in hypermutable DNA regions to reconstruct high-confidence phylogenetic trees. We found that in 65% of cases, lymphatic and distant metastases arose from independent subclones in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, whereas in 35% of cases they shared common subclonal origin. Therefore, two different lineage relationships between lymphatic and distant metastases exist in colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking in human cancer
<p>Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. One of these signatures, mainly found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carcinogen</span></strong>s. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types.</p>

The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages
<p>Long recognized as an evolutionarily ancient cell type involved in tissue homeostasis and immune defense against pathogens, macrophages are being rediscovered as regulators of several diseases, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Here we show that in mice, mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth induces the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-associated macrophages (TAMs) that are phenotypically and functionally distinct from mammary tissue macrophages (MTMs). TAMs express the adhesion molecule Vcam1 and proliferate upon their differentiation from inflammatory monocytes, but do not exhibit an “alternatively activated” phenotype. TAM terminal differentiation depends on the transcriptional regulator of Notch signaling, RBPJ; and TAM, but not MTM, depletion restores <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating cytotoxic T cell responses and suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth. These findings reveal the ontogeny of TAMs and a discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-elicited inflammatory response, which may provide new opportunities for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapy.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
RUNX2 correlates with subtype-specific breast cancer in a human tissue microarray, and ectopic expression of <i>Runx2</i> perturbs differentiation in the mouse mammary gland
<p>RUNX2, a master regulator of osteogenesis, is oncogenic in the lymphoid lineage; however, little is known about its role in epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Upregulation of <i>RUNX2</i> in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic disease in models of breast and prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this gene in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm <i>RUNX2</i> as a gene that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. To investigate the role of this gene in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, we made a transgenic model in which <i>Runx2</i> is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic <i>Runx2</i> perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating animals, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the <i>Runx2</i> transgene elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic animals, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to oncogenic changes and providing further evidence that this gene might have an important, context-dependent role in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to radiation. However, cardiac radiation exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> results in variable cardiac radiation exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac radiation dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> stage rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac radiation exposure during contemporary conformal breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

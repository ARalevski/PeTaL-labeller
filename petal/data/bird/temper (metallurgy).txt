Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> coronary, 161 (4.9%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> coronary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>/total cardiovascular events (10-year risk: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to risk prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and risk factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high risk.</p></sec>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels
<p>A wide variety of industrial applications require materials with high strength and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ing developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ening but retained high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-strength, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity materials.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

Genomic estimation of complex traits reveals ancient maize adaptation to temperate North America
<p>By 4000 years ago, people had introduced maize to the southwestern United States; full agriculture was established quickly in the lowland deserts but delayed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate highlands for 2000 years. We test if the earliest upland maize was adapted for early flowering, a characteristic of modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate maize. We sequenced fifteen 1900-year-old maize cobs from Turkey Pen Shelter in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate Southwest. Indirectly validated genomic models predicted that Turkey Pen maize was marginally adapted with respect to flowering, as well as short, tillering, and segregating for yellow kernel color. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate adaptation drove modern population differentiation and was selected in situ from ancient standing variation. Validated prediction of polygenic traits improves our understanding of ancient phenotypes and the dynamics of environmental adaptation.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened alloys exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as high as 50% in tension at ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale
<p>Theory predicts that higher biodiversity in the tropics is maintained by specialized interactions among plants and their natural enemies that result in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). By using more than 3000 species and nearly 2.4 million trees across 24 forest plots worldwide, we show that global patterns in tree species diversity reflect not only stronger CNDD at tropical versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate latitudes but also a latitudinal shift in the relationship between CNDD and species abundance. CNDD was stronger for rare species at tropical versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate latitudes, potentially causing the persistence of greater numbers of rare species in the tropics. Our study reveals fundamental differences in the nature of local-scale biotic interactions that contribute to the maintenance of species diversity across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate and tropical communities.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>er with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>atures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with conserved sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as well as between selection pressure on coding sequences of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence evolution as well as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

Physiological Responses and Gene Co-Expression Network of Mycorrhizal Roots under K<sup>+</sup> Deprivation
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations enhance the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host plants, but little is known about their role in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. <i>Medicago truncatula</i> plants were cocultured with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> under high and low K<sup>+</sup> regimes for 6 weeks. We determined how K<sup>+</sup> deprivation affects plant development and mineral acquisition and how these negative effects are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ed by the AM colonization. The transcriptional response of AM roots under K<sup>+</sup> deficiency was analyzed by whole-genome RNA sequencing. K<sup>+</sup> deprivation decreased root biomass and external K<sup>+</sup> uptake and modulated oxidative stress gene expression in <i>M. truncatula</i> roots. AM colonization induced specific transcriptional responses to K<sup>+</sup> deprivation that seem to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong> these negative effects. A gene network analysis revealed putative key regulators of these responses. This study confirmed that AM associations provide some tolerance to K<sup>+</sup> deprivation to host plants, revealed that AM symbiosis modulates the expression of specific root genes to cope with this nutrient stress, and identified putative regulators participating in these tolerance mechanisms.</p>

A Flowering Locus C Homolog Is a Vernalization-Regulated Repressor in <i>Brachypodium</i> and Is Cold Regulated in Wheat
<p>Winter cereals require prolonged cold to transition from vegetative to reproductive development. This process, referred to as vernalization, has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In Arabidopsis, a key flowering repressor called <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) quantitatively controls the vernalization requirement. By contrast, in cereals, the vernalization response is mainly regulated by the <i>VERNALIZATION</i> genes, <i>VRN1</i> and <i>VRN2</i>. Here, we characterize <i>ODDSOC2</i>, a recently identified <i>FLC</i> ortholog in monocots, knowing that it belongs to the <i>FLC</i> lineage. By studying its expression in a diverse set of <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions, we find that it is a good predictor of the vernalization requirement. Analyses of transgenics demonstrated that <i>BdODDSOC2</i> functions as a vernalization-regulated flowering repressor. In most <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions <i>BdODDSOC2</i> is down-regulated by cold, and in one of the winter accessions in which this down-regulation was evident, <i>BdODDSOC2</i> responded to cold before <i>BdVRN1.</i> When stably down-regulated, the mechanism is associated with spreading H3K27me3 modifications at the <i>BdODDSOC2</i> chromatin. Finally, homoeolog-specific gene expression analyses identify <i>TaAGL33</i> and its splice variant <i>TaAGL22</i> as the <i>FLC</i> orthologs in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) behaving most similar to <i>Brachypodium ODDSOC2</i>. Overall, our study suggests that <i>ODDSOC2</i> is not only phylogenetically related to <i>FLC</i> in eudicots but also functions as a flowering repressor in the vernalization pathway of <i>Brachypodium</i> and likely other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate grasses. These insights could prove useful in breeding efforts to refine the vernalization requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate cereals and adapt varieties to changing climates.</p>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature. The majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>iness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>atures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>iness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>iness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>iness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Photoperiodic control of seasonal growth is mediated by ABA acting on cell-cell communication
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate and boreal ecosystems, seasonal cycles of growth and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions. We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal growth cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular communication through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The communication blockage prevents growth-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious growth is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to growth-promoting signals.</p>

Study questions animal efficacy data behind trials
<p>Before biomedical researchers can test a new therapy in humans, a review panel is typically asked to consider not just the risks, but also the potential benefits. This "therapeutic potential" is almost always based on preclinical studies in animals. But a new study suggests that review panels may have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> time evaluating those studies because they don't receive nearly enough information. Researchers examined more than 100 brochures provided to three institutional review boards in Germany and found that the vast majority included animal efficacy studies that were unpublished or potentially vulnerable to bias. And less flattering studies seemed left out frequently, the team reports. But researchers not involved in the study are divided on the severity of the problem.</p>

Concern as HIV prevention strategy languishes
<p>Some 200,000 people uninfected with HIV now take antiretroviral drugs as preventive medicine—but 75% of them are in the United States. Called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, this daily pill has proved its worth in several clinical trials and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Other countries have been slow to adopt PrEP even though the World Health Organization recommended it for everyone at "substantial risk" of becoming infected. At the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections held in Boston last week, there was a growing clamor about the underuse of PrEP. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> hit sub-Saharan Africa, only Kenya aggressively promotes the use of PrEP. Evidence from San Francisco, California, and the state of New South Wales in Australia, which both have prominent PrEP campaigns, shows that it has helped reduce new infection rates. Several presenters at the meeting discussed why PrEP has been slow to catch on both at the government level and with people who are at high risk of becoming infected. In 2016, nearly 2 million more people became infected with the AIDS virus, bringing the global total to 37 million.</p>

<p>Viruses regulate host metabolic networks to improve their survival. The molecules that are responsive to viral infection and regulate such metabolic changes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ly known, but are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by multiple viruses, but not by type I interferon (IFN-I), and facilitates viral replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by its nearest coding gene <i>Acod1</i>, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection through IFN-I–IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3)–independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-ACOD1 directly binds the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its metabolites could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality. This work reveals a feedback mechanism of virus-induced lncRNA-mediated metabolic promotion of viral infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics.</p>

Echoes of Ebola as plague hits Madagascar
<p>Hundreds of epidemiologists and technical experts are pouring into Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world, to help fight an unprecedented plague epidemic. By 20 October, 1297 people had been infected and 102 had died, and cases are doubling weekly. Worries are high that the outbreak will spread to nearby countries and territories in Africa and the Indian Ocean, where governments are scrambling to prepare. Madagascar is one of the few countries in the world still <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> hit by plague, which decimated Europe's population during the Black Death in the Middle Ages. The disease is endemic in the central highlands, where small outbreaks occur most years. Most are bubonic plague, transmitted from rats to humans by the bite of a flea. Now, for the first time, plague is hitting urban areas, including Antananarivo, the capital, and the port city Toamasina, and it has taken an unusual and especially menacing form: pneumonic plague, which is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Without treatment, pneumonic plague is 100% fatal. Infectious disease experts say the outbreak underscores one lesson of the Ebola epidemic of 2 years ago: As cities burgeon and populations become more mobile, once-isolated diseases are increasingly likely to reach cities, where they can race out of control.</p>

Mapping spiral structure on the far side of the Milky Way
<p>Little is known about the portion of the Milky Way lying beyond the Galactic center at distances of more than 9 kiloparsec from the Sun. These regions are opaque at optical wavelengths because of absorption by interstellar dust, and distances are very large and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> to measure. We report a direct trigonometric parallax distance of <bold>[Formula]</bold> kiloparsec obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array to a water maser source in a region of active star formation.

The balance between immunity and inflammation
<p>Lungs execute two critical functions that can be at odds with one another: eliminating harmful toxins, particulates, and microbes; and exchanging gas through uninflamed structures—alveoli—to collect oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide. Lungs have a multilayered response to unwanted invaders, offering physical barriers as well as arranging immune cells at airway surfaces. Yet, lungs have the “Goldilocks” challenge of deploying this armory with just the right amount of inflammation. Consequently, lung immunity must be choreographed so that invaders are purged quickly, inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ed, and homeostasis preserved. In this issue, two papers reveal how lung immunity handles these tasks and what happens when things go awry. Shlezinger <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) on page 1037 unveil a clever trick that neutrophils play on inhaled fungal spores to resist life-threatening infections. This may reveal new treatment strategies. On page 1014, Sinclair <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report metabolic derangements in dendritic cells (DCs) that reprogram the allergic response to inhaled particulates, with implications for asthma.</p>

Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage transfer (lysogenic conversion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic conversion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the transfer of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic conversion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ transfer was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent transfer. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ transfer. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate bacteriophages.</p>

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics
<p>Feedback with soil biota is an important determinant of terrestrial plant diversity. However, the factors regulating plant-soil feedback, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-soil feedbacks. In soil collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-soil feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate forests.</p>

Localized seismic deformation in the upper mantle revealed by dense seismic arrays
<p>Seismicity along continental transform faults is usually confined to the upper half of the crust, but the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), a major fault traversing the Los Angeles basin, is seismically active down to the upper mantle. We use seismic array analysis to illuminate the seismogenic root of the NIF beneath Long Beach, California, and identify seismicity in an actively deforming localized zone penetrating the lithospheric mantle. Deep earthquakes, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e fault zone matrix.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA biosynthesis and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA biosynthesis upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA biosynthesis. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA biosynthesis and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA biosynthesis. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in cotton.</p>

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We identified five CT-related genetic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic loci related to CT have been identified. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was identified as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci identified here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, drought-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of drought tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from −1.7 ± 0.25 MPa to −3.74 ± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from −1.17 ± 0.04 MPa to −4.91 ± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of drought tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during drought.</p>

Preferential Distribution of Boron to Developing Tissues Is Mediated by the Intrinsic Protein OsNIP3
<p>Boron is especially required for the growth of meristem and reproductive organs, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the preferential distribution of B to these developing tissues are poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a member of nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP), OsNIP3;1, is involved in this preferential distribution in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). <i>OsNIP3</i>;<i>1</i> was highly expressed in the nodes and its expression was up-regulated by B deficiency, but down-regulated by high B. OsNIP3;1 was polarly localized at the xylem parenchyma cells of enlarged vascular bundles of nodes facing toward the xylem vessels. Furthermore, this protein was rapidly degraded within a few hours in response to high B. Knockout of this gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ly affected the uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of B, but altered B distribution in different organs in the above-ground parts, decreased distribution of B to the new leaves, and increased distribution to the old leaves. These results indicate that OsNIP3;1 located in the nodes is involved in the preferential distribution of B to the developing tissues by unloading B from the xylem in rice and that it is regulated at both transcriptional and protein level in response to external B level.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect plant gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on plant leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land plant groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest plant group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular plants, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land plant stomatal responses.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde oxidases are a multigene family of four oxidases (AAO1–AAO4) that oxidize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is oxidized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by oxidation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde oxidases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via oxidation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently oxidize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen peroxide shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing drought tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate areas. Our goal was to investigate drought stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a drought-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> × <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of droughted and irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under drought, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon drought and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. Drought effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of drought-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to drought.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>atures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>atures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>atures. High ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>atures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>atures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ature in barley.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate cereals.</p>

Limits to sustained energy intake. XXVII. Trade-offs between first and second litters in lactating mice support the ecological context hypothesis
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Data from this paper indicate that there may be a ‘soft’ limit dependent on female ‘choice’ on energy allocation to their litters, rather than a ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>’, unbreachable limit defined by aspects of maternal physiology as is commonly assumed.</p>

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p>Female insects of diverse orders bore into substrates to deposit their eggs. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the forces required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> substrates.</p>

Olfactory foraging in temperate waters: sensitivity to dimethylsulphide of shearwaters in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea
<p>Many procellariiforms use olfactory cues to locate food patches over the seemingly featureless ocean surface. In particular, some of them are able to detect and are attracted by dimethylsulphide (DMS), a volatile compound naturally occurring over worldwide oceans in correspondence with productive feeding areas. However, current knowledge is restricted to sub-Antarctic species and to only one study realized under natural conditions at sea. Here, for the first time, we investigated the response to DMS in parallel in two different environments in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ate waters, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, employing Cory's (<i>Calonectris borealis</i>) and Scopoli's (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>) shearwaters as models. To test whether these birds can detect and respond to DMS, we presented them with this substance in a Y-maze. Then, to determine whether they use this molecule in natural conditions, we tested the response to DMS at sea. The number of birds that chose DMS in the Y-maze and that were recruited at DMS-scented slicks at sea suggests that these shearwaters are attracted to DMS in both non-foraging and natural contexts. Our findings show that the use of DMS as a foraging cue may be a strategy adopted by procellariiforms across oceans but that regional differences may exist, giving a worldwide perspective to previous hypotheses concerning the use of DMS as a chemical cue.</p>

Oxidised zirconium <i>versus</i> cobalt alloy bearing surfaces in total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to establish whether an oxidised zirconium (OxZr) femoral   component causes less loss of polyethylene volume than a cobalt   alloy (CoCr) femoral component in total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 20 retrieved tibial inserts that had articulated with   OxZr components were matched with 20 inserts from CoCr articulations   for patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and revision   diagnosis.

Predictors of mortality following conservatively managed fractures of the odontoid in elderly patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rates of mortality as high as 25% to 30% have been described   following fractures of the odontoid in the elderly population. The   aim of this study was to examine whether easily identifiable variables   present on admission are associated with mortality. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A consecutive series of 83 elderly patients with a fracture of   the odontoid following a low-impact injury was identified retrospectively.   Data that were collected included demographics, past medical history   and the results of blood tests on admission. Radiological investigations   were used to assess the Anderson and D’Alonzo classification and   displacement of the fracture. The mean age was 82.9 years (65 to   101). Most patients (66; 79.5%) had a type 2 fracture. An associated   neurological deficit was present in 11 (13.3%). All were treated   conservatively; 80 (96.4%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong> collar and three (3.6%) with   halo vest immobilisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of mortality was 16% (13 patients) at 30 days and 24%   (20 patients) at one year after injury. A low serum level of haemoglobin   and the presence of a neurological deficit on admission were independent   predicators of mortality at 30 days on binary logistic regression   analysis. A, low level of haemoglobin, admission from an institution,   a neurological deficit and type 3 fractures were independent predictors   of mortality at one year. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that these easily identifiable predictors present   on admission can be used to identify patients at high risk and guide   management by a multidisciplinary team.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:116–21.</p></sec>

Clinical outcomes following re-admission for non-infectious wound complications after primary total knee replacement
<p>Haematomas, drainage, and other non-infectious   wound complications following total knee replacement (TKR) have   been associated with long-term sequelae, in particular, deep infection.   However, the impact of these wound complications on clinical outcome   is unknown. This study compares results in 15 patients re-admitted   for wound complications within 90 days of TKR to 30 matched patients   who underwent uncomplicated total knee replacements. Patients with   wound complications had a mean age of 66 years (49 to 83) and mean   body mass index (BMI) of 37 (21 to 54), both similar to that of   patients without complications (mean age 65 years and mean BMI 35). Those   with complications had lower mean Knee Society function scores (46   (0 to 100 <i>vs</i> 66 (20 to 100), p = 0.047) and a higher   incidence of mild or greater pain (73% <i>vs</i> 33%,   p = 0.01) after two years compared with the non re-admitted group.   Expectations in patients with wound complications following TKR   should be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temper</span></strong>ed, even in those who do not develop an infection.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:619–21.</p>

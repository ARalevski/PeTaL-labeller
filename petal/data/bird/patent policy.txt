Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns and doses of insulin
<p>Secretion of insulin transiently increases after eating, resulting in a high circulating concentration. Fasting limits insulin secretion, resulting in a low concentration of insulin in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional responses to different temporal patterns and doses of insulin in the hepatoma FAO cells and identified 13 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated and 16 down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated insulin-responsive genes (IRGs). The up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs responded more rapidly than did the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in insulin concentration, whereas the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs were repressed at lower concentrations of insulin than those required to stimulate the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs. Mathematical modeling of the insulin response as two stages—(i) insulin signaling to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability—indicated that the first stage was the more rapid stage for the down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs, whereas the second stage of transcription was the more rapid stage for the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated IRGs. A subset of the IRGs that were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated or down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the FAO cells was similarly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of insulin. Thus, not only can cells respond to insulin but they can also interpret the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant insulin production or tissue responsiveness.</p>

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-out and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-out or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>d out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rule</span></strong>-in and overall efficacy are decreased.

The dual frontier: Patented inventions and prior scientific advance
<p>The extent to which scientific advances support marketplace <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong>ions is largely unknown. We study 4.8 million U.S. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s and 32 million research articles to determine the minimum citation distance between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invent</span></strong>ions and prior scientific advances. We find that most cited research articles (80%) link forward to a future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>. Similarly, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s (61%) link backward to a prior research article. Linked papers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s typically stand 2 to 4 degrees distant from the other domain. Yet, advances directly along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>-paper boundary are notably more impactful within their own domains. The distance metric further provides a typology of the fields, institutions, and individuals involved in science-to-technology linkages. Overall, the findings are consistent with theories that emphasize substantial and fruitful connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing and prior scientific inquiry.</p>

The applied value of public investments in biomedical research
<p>Scientists and policy-makers have long argued that public investments in science have practical applications. Using data on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s linked to U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants over a 27-year period, we provide a large-scale accounting of linkages between public research investments and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing. We find that about 10% of NIH grants generate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong> directly but 30% generate articles that are subsequently cited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>s. Although policy-makers often focus on direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing by academic scientists, the bulk of the effect of NIH research on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>ing appears to be indirect. We also find no systematic relationship between the “basic” versus “applied” research focus of a grant and its propensity to be cited by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patent</span></strong>.</p>

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B radiation in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B radiation, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B radiation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B radiation, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Regulation of Sucrose Transporters and Phloem Loading in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>Suc transporters (SUTs) play a key role in the allocation and partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. While a function could be assigned to many members of the SUT family, almost no information is available on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Here, the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of SUTs in response to various environmental stimuli in the leaves of five dicots (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], soybean [<i>Glycine max</i>], potato [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>], tomato [<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i>], and poplar [<i>Populus</i> spp.]) and four monocots (maize [<i>Zea</i> <i>mays</i>], rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>], and barley [<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]) was investigated. Extensive data on expression of <i>SUT</i>s in relation to changes of environmental conditions were obtained through a global analysis of 168 transcriptomics data sets. Results were validated by quantitative PCR measurements and extended by the measurement of photosynthesis rate and phloem sugar content to draw insight on the correlation of <i>SUT</i> expression and sugar export from leaves. For the apoplasmic phloem loaders, a clear difference in transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation in response to different environmental stimuli was observed. The consistent patterns of <i>SUT</i> expression under abiotic stress indicates which types of SUTs are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of leaf sugar status and in stress signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of phloem loading is likely to be caused by transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of SUTs, while up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation depends on post-transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. In poplar, expression of <i>PtaSUT4</i> was found to consistently respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting a significant role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of sugar export from leaves in this passive symplasmic phloem loader.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator MYC2 was up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

Type B Response Regulators Act As Central Integrators in Transcriptional Control of the Auxin Biosynthesis Enzyme TAA1
<p>During embryogenesis and organ formation, establishing proper gradient is critical for auxin function, which is achieved through coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of both auxin metabolism and transport. Expression of auxin biosynthetic genes is often tissue specific and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by environmental signals. However, the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of a key auxin biosynthetic gene, <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1 (<i>TAA1</i>). A canonical and a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator (ARR) binding site were identified in the promoter and the second intron of <i>TAA1</i>, which were required for its tissue-specific expression. C-termini of a subset of the type B ARRs selectively bind to one or both cis elements and activate the expression of <i>TAA1</i>. We further demonstrated that the ARRs not only mediate the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>TAA1</i> by cytokinins, but also mediate its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation by ethylene, light, and developmental signals. Through direct protein-protein interactions, the transcriptional activity of ARR1 is enhanced by ARR12, DELLAs, and ethylene-insenstive3 (EIN3). Our study thus revealed the ARR proteins act as key node that mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of auxin biosynthesis by various hormonal, environmental, and developmental signals through transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the key auxin biosynthesis gene <i>TAA1</i>.</p>

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate many aspects of plant growth and development, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral development. Negative feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-binding motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-binding sites exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic plants, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Mutations in four GAF1-binding sites abolished the negative feedback of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic plants. Our results showed that GAF1-binding sites are necessary for GA feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>, suggesting that the DELLA-GAF1 complex is a main component of the GA feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>.</p>

The BABY BOOM Transcription Factor Activates the LEC1-ABI3-FUS3-LEC2 Network to Induce Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>Somatic embryogenesis is an example of induced cellular totipotency, where embryos develop from vegetative cells rather than from gamete fusion. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators and/or stress treatments. The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2 transcription factors are key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of plant cell totipotency, as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings without exogenous growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators or stress treatments. Although LEC and BBM proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the same developmental process, it is not known whether they function in the same molecular pathway. We show that BBM transcriptionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates <i>LEC1</i> and <i>LEC2</i>, as well as the two other <i>LAFL</i> genes, <i>FUSCA3</i> (<i>FUS3</i>) and <i>ABSCISIC ACID</i> <i>INSENSITIVE3</i> (<i>ABI3</i>). LEC2 and ABI3 quantitatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis, while FUS3 and LEC1 are essential for this process. BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis is dose and context dependent, and the context-dependent phenotypes are associated with differential <i>LAFL</i> expression. We also uncover functional redundancy for somatic embryogenesis among other Arabidopsis BBM-like proteins and show that one of these proteins, PLETHORA2, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates <i>LAFL</i> gene expression. Our data place BBM upstream of other major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of plant embryo identity and totipotency.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation) and (2) down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, while genes related to autophagy were up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

Two B-Box Proteins Regulate Photomorphogenesis by Oppositely Modulating HY5 through their Diverse C-Terminal Domains
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BBX family comprises several positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of photomorphogenesis. BBX24, a member of BBX structural group IV, acts as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of photomorphogenesis, whereas another member from the same group, BBX21, is a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator. The molecular basis for the functional diversity shown by these related BBX family members is unknown. Using domain-swap lines, we show that the C-terminal regions of BBX24 and BBX21 specify their function. Because both BBX21 and BBX24 work in close association with HY5, we hypothesized that these proteins differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the levels or activity of HY5 to fulfill their opposite roles. We show that BBX21 can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate HY5 post-transcriptionally and the two proteins can coordinate to promote photomorphogenesis. By contrast, BBX24 interferes with the binding of HY5 to the promoter of an anthocyanin biosynthetic gene, possibly by heterodimerizing with HY5 and preventing it from binding DNA. Our finding that both BBX21 and BBX24 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate HY5 activity post-transcriptionally, in opposite ways, suggests that closely related B-box proteins execute contrasting functions through differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of HY5.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant resistance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate resistance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to resistance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, ABA still induces resistance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant resistance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV resistance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated resistance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation partially contributes to ABA-mediated resistance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

The Transcription Factor MYB29 Is a Regulator of <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i>
<p>Plants sense and integrate a variety of signals from the environment through different interacting signal transduction pathways that involve hormones and signaling molecules. Using <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i> (<i>AOX1a</i>) gene expression as a model system of retrograde or stress signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN29 (MYB29) was identified as a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of alternative oxidase1a 7</i> [<i>rao7</i>] mutant) in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>rao7/myb29</i> mutants have increased levels of AOX1a transcript and protein compared to wild type after induction with antimycin A. A variety of genes previously associated with the mitochondrial stress response also display enhanced transcript abundance, indicating that RAO7/MYB29 negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates mitochondrial stress responses in general. Meta-analysis of hormone-responsive marker genes and identification of downstream transcription factor networks revealed that MYB29 functions in the complex interplay of ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and reactive oxygen species signaling by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the expression of various ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR and WRKY transcription factors. Despite an enhanced induction of mitochondrial stress response genes, <i>rao7</i>/<i>myb29</i> mutants displayed an increased sensitivity to combined moderate light and drought stress. These results uncover interactions between mitochondrial retrograde signaling and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of glucosinolate biosynthesis, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by RAO7/MYB29.

Signaling by two-component system noncognate partners promotes intrinsic tolerance to polymyxin B in uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>Bacteria use two-component systems (TCSs) to react appropriately to environmental stimuli. Typical TCSs comprise a sensor histidine kinase that acts as a receptor coupled to a partner response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator that coordinates changes in bacterial behavior, often through its activity as a transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator. TCS interactions are typically confined to cognate pairs of histidine kinases and response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators. We describe two distinct TCSs in uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (UPEC) that interact to mediate a response to ferric iron. The PmrAB and QseBC TCSs were both required for proper transcriptional response to ferric iron. Ferric iron induced the histidine kinase PmrB to phosphotransfer to both its cognate response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator PmrA and the noncognate response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator QseB, leading to transcriptional responses coordinated by both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators. Pretreatment of the UPEC strain UTI89 with ferric iron led to increased resistance to polymyxin B that required both PmrA and QseB. Similarly, pretreatment of several UPEC isolates with ferric iron increased tolerance to polymyxin B. This study defines physiologically relevant cross talk between TCSs in a bacterial pathogen and provides a potential mechanism for antibiotic resistance of some strains of UPEC.</p>

CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6: A Key Regulator of Na<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis during Germination
<p>Salinity impairs seed germination and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in salinity stress responses during early germination. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During germination, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the salt tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without salt treatment revealed 1,020 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated and 1,467 down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated salt-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated and 1,242 down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known salt stress-associated genes, including <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the salt-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site. We suggest that CAMTA6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates, directly or indirectly, the expression of most of the salt-responsive genes in germinating seeds, including genes that are crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and salt stress tolerance.</p>

ANAC017 Coordinates Organellar Functions and Stress Responses by Reprogramming Retrograde Signaling
<p>Mitochondria adjust their activities in response to external and internal stimuli to optimize growth via the mitochondrial retrograde response signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NAC domain transcription factor ANAC017 has previously been identified as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of the mitochondrial retrograde response. We show here that overexpression of <i>ANAC017</i> in Arabidopsis leads to growth retardation, altered leaf development with decreased cell size and viability, and early leaf senescence. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that increased <i>ANAC017</i> expression leads to higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial stress, cell death/autophagy, and leaf senescence under nonlimiting growth conditions as well as extensive repression of chloroplast function. Gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory network analysis indicated that a complex hierarchy of transcription factors exists downstream of ANAC017. These involve a set of up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated ANAC and WRKY transcription factors associated with organellar signaling and senescence. The network also includes a number of ethylene- and gibberellic acid-related transcription factors with established functions in stress responses and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, which down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate their target genes.

Our results show that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane tethering of the constitutively expressed ANAC017, and its controlled release, are crucial to fine-tune a fast reactive but potentially harmful signaling cascade. Thus, ANAC017 is a master <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of cellular responses with mitochondria acting as central sensors.</p>

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective maintenance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators are altered and down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche maintenance in Arabidopsis.</p>

Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant growth and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phytohormones, especially in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA promotes the accumulation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate AsA biosynthesis via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively.

In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on plant growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of plant growth and modulation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated plant growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation during its interaction with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of plant-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation.

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity

Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-salinity (salt) up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes in the root or the shoot.

Although <i>SPOROCYTELESS</i> (<i>SPL</i>) transcription is activated by the floral organ identity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator AGAMOUS and epigenetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by SET DOMAIN GROUP2, little is known about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the SPL protein. Here, we report that the protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6 can both interact with SPL in vitro and in vivo and can phosphorylate the SPL protein in vitro. In addition, phosphorylation of the SPL protein by MPK3/6 is required for SPL function in the Arabidopsis anther, as measured by its effect on archesporial cell differentiation. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation enhances SPL protein stability. This work not only uncovers the importance of SPL phosphorylation for its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory role in Arabidopsis anther development, but also supports the hypothesis that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of precise spatiotemporal patterning of germ cell initiation and that differentiation is achieved progressively through multiple levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation, including transcriptional and posttranslational modification.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA (SUF4) Supports Gamete Fusion via Regulating Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> Gene Expression
<p>The <i>EGG CELL1</i> (<i>EC1</i>) gene family of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) comprises five members that are specifically expressed in the egg cell and redundantly control gamete fusion during double fertilization. We investigated the activity of all five <i>EC1</i> promoters in promoter-deletion studies and identified SUF4 (SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA4), a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> transcription factor, as a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of the <i>EC1</i> gene expression. In particular, we demonstrated that SUF4 binds to all five Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> promoters, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating their expression. The down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>SUF4</i> in homozygous <i>suf4-1</i> ovules results in reduced <i>EC1</i> expression and delayed sperm fusion, which can be rescued by expressing SUF4-β-glucuronidase under the control of the <i>SUF4</i> promoter. To identify more gene products able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate <i>EC1</i> expression together with SUF4, we performed coexpression studies that led to the identification of <i>MOM1</i> (<i>MORPHEUS’ MOLECULE1</i>), a component of a silencing mechanism that is independent of DNA methylation marks. In <i>mom1-3</i> ovules, both <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> genes are down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, and <i>EC1</i> genes show higher levels of histone 3 lysine-9 acetylation, suggesting that MOM1 contributes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> gene expression.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin focus that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2 enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to actin remodeling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin focus size and altered focus morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin focus are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

The RNA-binding protein ELAV regulates Hox RNA processing, expression and function within the <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated head-to-tail expression of Hox genes provides a coordinate system for the activation of specific programmes of cell differentiation according to axial level. Recent work indicates that Hox expression can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated via RNA processing but the underlying mechanisms and biological significance of this form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation remain poorly understood. Here we explore these issues within the developing <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system (CNS). We show that the pan-neural RNA-binding protein (RBP) ELAV (Hu antigen) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the RNA processing patterns of the Hox gene <i>Ultrabithorax</i> (<i>Ubx</i>) within the embryonic CNS. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic and imaging approaches we demonstrate that ELAV binds to discrete elements within <i>Ubx</i> RNAs and that its genetic removal reduces Ubx protein expression in the CNS leading to the respecification of cellular subroutines under <i>Ubx</i> control, thus defining for the first time a specific cellular role of ELAV within the developing CNS. Artificial provision of ELAV in glial cells (a cell type that lacks ELAV) promotes Ubx expression, suggesting that ELAV-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation might contribute to cell type-specific Hox expression patterns within the CNS. Finally, we note that expression of <i>abdominal A</i> and <i>Abdominal B</i> is reduced in <i>elav</i> mutant embryos, whereas other Hox genes (<i>Antennapedia</i>) are not affected. Based on these results and the evolutionary conservation of ELAV and Hox genes we propose that the modulation of Hox RNA processing by ELAV serves to adapt the morphogenesis of the CNS to axial level by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating Hox expression and consequently activating local programmes of neural differentiation.</p>

This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of angiotensinogen.

Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes.

<p>Ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit coloration is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit coloration as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration.

ZEITLUPE in the Roots of Wild Tobacco Regulates Jasmonate-Mediated Nicotine Biosynthesis and Resistance to a Generalist Herbivore
<p>The jasmonate (JA) phytohormone signaling system is an important mediator of plant defense against herbivores. Plants deficient in JA signaling are more susceptible to herbivory as a result of deficiencies in defensive trait expression. Recent studies have implicated the circadian clock in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating JA-mediated defenses, but the molecular mechanisms linking the clock to JA signaling are unclear. Here, we report that wild tobacco (<i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>) plants rendered deficient in the clock component ZEITLUPE (ZTL) by RNA interference have attenuated resistance to the generalist herbivore <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i>. This effect can be attributed in part to reduced concentrations of nicotine, an abundant JA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated toxin produced in <i>N. attenuata</i> roots and transported to shoots. RNA interference targeting ZTL dramatically affects the root circadian clock and reduces the expression of nicotine biosynthetic genes. Protein-protein interaction experiments demonstrate that ZTL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates JA signaling by directly interacting with JASMONATE ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins in a CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1- and jasmonoyl-isoleucine conjugate-independent manner, thereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating a JAZ-MYC2 module that is required for nicotine biosynthesis.

FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Plays a Dual Role in Regulating Type I MADS-Box Genes in Early Endosperm Development
<p>Early endosperm development presents a unique system in which to uncover epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory mechanisms because the contributing maternal and paternal genomes possess differential epigenetic modifications. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon fertilization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the type I MADS-box gene family, which has been shown previously to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-box genes (C2 genes) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 genes were mostly up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 genes subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of C2 type I MADS-box genes, as evidenced by a generalized role in the repression of gene expression at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted genes.</p>

The Citrus Transcription Factor CsMADS6 Modulates Carotenoid Metabolism by Directly Regulating Carotenogenic Genes
<p>Although remarkable progress has been made toward understanding carotenoid biosynthesis, the mechanisms that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate the transcription of carotenogenic genes remain poorly understood. Lycopene β-cyclases (LCYb) are critical enzymes located at the branch point of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Here, we used the promoter sequence of <i>LCYb1</i> as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen for promoter-binding proteins from sweet orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>). This screen identified a MADS transcription factor, CsMADS6, that was coordinately expressed with fruit development and coloration. Acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator, CsMADS6 directly bound the promoter of <i>LCYb1</i> and activated its expression. Overexpression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in citrus calli increased carotenoid contents and induced the expression of <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic genes, including <i>phytoene synthase</i> (<i>PSY</i>), <i>phytoene desaturase</i> (<i>PDS</i>), and <i>carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase1</i> (<i>CCD1</i>). CsMADS6 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated the expression of <i>PSY</i>, <i>PDS</i>, and <i>CCD1</i> by directly binding to their promoters, which suggested the multitargeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of carotenoid metabolism by CsMADS6. In addition, the ectopic expression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) affected carotenoid contents and the expression of carotenogenic genes. The sepals of <i>CsMADS6</i>-overexpressing tomato lines exhibited dramatic changes in carotenoid profiles, accompanied by changes in plastid ultrastructure. Global transcriptome analysis of transgenic sepals revealed that CsMADS6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates a series of pathways that promote increases in flux through the carotenoid pathway. Overall, these findings establish that CsMADS6 directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic genes to coordinately and positively modulate carotenoid metabolism in plants, which may provide strategies to improve the nutritional quality of crops.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p>Plant immune responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered immunity, are tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated. This results in low immune responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate salicylic acid accumulation and immunity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>).

Transcriptome profiling revealed the effects of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of immunity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> plants retain elevated levels longer than wild-type plants. Assays for the effect of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the effect is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> plants. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates

Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Seven tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic acids, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation by the 2-oxo acids pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.</p>

TCP Transcription Factors Regulate Shade Avoidance via Directly Mediating the Expression of Both <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR</i>s and Auxin Biosynthetic Genes
<p>Light quality surrounding a plant is largely determined by the density of its neighboring vegetation.

PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are key factors in the SAS network by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating the biosynthesis of multiple phytohormones and the expression of cell expansion genes. Although the protein levels of PIFs were found to be acumulated in shade, the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>PIFs</i> in response to such an environmental signal remains poorly understood.

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>

We show that including recent insights about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>OsWRKY53</i> overexpression led to enlarged leaf angles and increased grain size, in contrast to the erect leaves and smaller seeds in <i>oswrky53</i> mutant.

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful fertilization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther opening (dehiscence), results in male sterility, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and fertility. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and fertility rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory controls through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther opening.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a plant’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host plant, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in leaves of AM plants differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the leaves of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM leaves. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in leaves. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in leaves of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM leaves. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in leaves are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

NTL8 Regulates Trichome Formation in Arabidopsis by Directly Activating R3 MYB Genes <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>
<p>The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) are plant-specific transcription factors that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate multiple aspects of plant growth and development and plant response to environmental stimuli. We report here the identification of NTM1-LIKE8 (NTL8), a membrane-associated NAC transcription factor, as a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of trichome formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). From an activation-tagged Arabidopsis population, we identified a dominant, gain-of-function mutant with glabrous inflorescence stem. By using plasmid rescue and RT-PCR analyses, we found that <i>NTL8</i> was tagged; thus, the mutant was named <i>ntl8-1 Dominant</i> (<i>ntl8-1D</i>). Recapitulation experiment further confirmed that the phenotype observed in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant was caused by elevated expression of <i>NTL8</i>. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of the single-repeat R3 MYB genes <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> (<i>TRY</i>) and <i>TRICHOMELESS1</i> (<i>TCL1</i>) was elevated in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant. Genetic analyses demonstrated that NTL8 acts upstream of TRY and TCL1 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of trichome formation. When recruited to the promoter region of the reporter gene <i>Gal4:GUS</i> by a fused GAL4 DNA-binding domain, NTL8 activated the expression of the reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i> are direct targets of NTL8. However, NTL8 did not interact with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE9, another transcription factor that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>, in yeast and plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NTL8 negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates trichome formation in Arabidopsis by directly activating the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>.</p>

Poplar MYB115 and MYB134 Transcription Factors Regulate Proanthocyanidin Synthesis and Structure
<p>The accumulation of proanthocyanidins is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by a complex of transcription factors composed of R2R3 MYB, basic helix-loop-helix, and WD40 proteins that activate the promoters of biosynthetic genes. In poplar (genus <i>Populus</i>), MYB134 is known to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ate proanthocyanidin biosynthesis by activating key flavonoid genes. Here, we characterize a second MYB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of proanthocyanidins, MYB115. Transgenic poplar overexpressing MYB115 showed a high-proanthocyanidin phenotype and reduced salicinoid accumulation, similar to the effects of MYB134 overexpression. Transcriptomic analysis of MYB115- and MYB134-overexpressing poplar plants identified a set of common up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated genes encoding proanthocyanidin biosynthetic enzymes and several novel uncharacterized MYB transcriptional repressors. Transient expression experiments demonstrated the capacity of both MYB134 and MYB115 to activate flavonoid promoters, but only in the presence of a basic helix-loop-helix cofactor. Yeast two-hybrid experiments confirmed the direct interaction of these transcription factors. The unexpected identification of dihydromyricetin in leaf extracts of both MYB115- and MYB134-overexpressing poplar led to the discovery of enhanced flavonoid B-ring hydroxylation and an increased proportion of prodelphinidins in proanthocyanidin of the transgenics. The dramatic hydroxylation phenotype of MYB115 overexpressors is likely due to the up-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of both flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylases and cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>5</sub>. Overall, this work provides new insight into the complexity of the gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory network for proanthocyanidin synthesis in poplar.</p>

Light Controls Cytokinin Signaling via Transcriptional Regulation of Constitutively Active Sensor Histidine Kinase CKI1
<p>In plants, the multistep phosphorelay (MSP) pathway mediates a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory processes, including those activated by cytokinins. The cross talk between cytokinin response and light has been known for a long time. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between light and cytokinin signaling remains elusive. In the screen for upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators we identified a <i>LONG PALE HYPOCOTYL</i> (<i>LPH</i>) gene whose activity is indispensable for spatiotemporally correct expression of <i>CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1</i> (<i>CKI1</i>), encoding the constitutively active sensor His kinase that activates MSP signaling. <i>lph</i> is a new allele of <i>HEME OXYGENASE1</i> (<i>HY1</i>) that encodes the key protein in the biosynthesis of phytochromobilin, a cofactor of photoconvertible phytochromes. Our analysis confirmed the light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the <i>CKI1</i> expression pattern. We show that <i>CKI1</i> expression is under the control of phytochrome A (phyA), functioning as a dual (both positive and negative) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of <i>CKI1</i> expression, presumably via the phyA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated transcription factors (TF) PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1. Changes in <i>CKI1</i> expression observed in <i>lph</i>/<i>hy1</i>-<i>7</i> and <i>phy</i> mutants correlate with mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of MSP signaling, changed cytokinin sensitivity, and developmental aberrations that were previously shown to be associated with cytokinin and/or CKI1 action. Besides that, we demonstrate a novel role of phyA-dependent <i>CKI1</i> expression in the hypocotyl elongation and hook development during skotomorphogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that the light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>CKI1</i> provides a plausible mechanistic link underlying the well-known interaction between light- and cytokinin-controlled plant development.</p>

Suppressor of Overexpression of CO 1 Negatively Regulates Dark-Induced Leaf Degreening and Senescence by Directly Repressing Pheophytinase and Other Senescence-Associated Genes in Arabidopsis
<p>Although the biochemical pathway of chlorophyll (Chl) degradation has been largely elucidated, how Chl is rapidly yet coordinately degraded during leaf senescence remains elusive. Pheophytinase (PPH) is the enzyme for catalyzing the removal of the phytol group from pheophytin <i>a</i>, and <i>PPH</i> expression is significantly induced during leaf senescence. To elucidate the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of <i>PPH</i>, we used a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) one-hybrid system to screen for its trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a key flowering pathway integrator, was initially identified as one of the putative trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators of <i>PPH</i>. After dark treatment, leaves of an <i>SOC1</i> knockdown mutant (<i>soc1-6</i>) showed an accelerated yellowing phenotype, whereas those of <i>SOC1</i>-overexpressing lines exhibited a partial stay-green phenotype. <i>SOC1</i> and <i>PPH</i> expression showed a negative correlation during leaf senescence. Substantially, SOC1 protein could bind specifically to the CArG box of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of <i>SOC1</i> significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protoplasts. Importantly, <i>soc1-6 pph-1</i> (a <i>PPH</i> knockout mutant) double mutant displayed a stay-green phenotype similar to that of <i>pph-1</i> during dark treatment. These results demonstrated that SOC1 inhibits Chl degradation via negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating <i>PPH</i> expression. In addition, measurement of the Chl content and the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II of <i>soc1-6</i> and <i>SOC1-OE</i> leaves after dark treatment suggested that SOC1 also negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates the general senescence process. Seven <i>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES</i> (<i>SAGs</i>) were thereafter identified as its potential target genes, and <i>NONYELLOWING1</i> and <i>SAG113</i> were experimentally confirmed. Together, we reveal that SOC1 represses dark-induced leaf Chl degradation and senescence in general in Arabidopsis.</p>

The OsMYB30 Transcription Factor Suppresses Cold Tolerance by Interacting with a JAZ Protein and Suppressing <i>β</i>-Amylase Expression
<p>Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ators in the cold stress response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene, <i>OsMYB30</i>, for its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory function in cold tolerance in rice. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of <i>OsMYB30</i> in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the <i>osmyb30</i> knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that a few β-amylase (<i>BMY</i>) genes were down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by OsMYB30. The <i>BMY</i> activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the <i>OsMYB30</i> overexpression and <i>osmyb30</i> knockout mutant, respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the <i>BMY</i> genes. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the <i>BMY</i> genes. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory effect on the breakdown of starch through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the <i>BMY</i> genes. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein, OsJAZ9, that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of <i>BMY</i> genes mediated by OsMYB30. These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ator of cold tolerance through the negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation of the <i>BMY</i> genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine-tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose, which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.</p>

A Flowering Locus C Homolog Is a Vernalization-Regulated Repressor in <i>Brachypodium</i> and Is Cold Regulated in Wheat
<p>Winter cereals require prolonged cold to transition from vegetative to reproductive development. This process, referred to as vernalization, has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In Arabidopsis, a key flowering repressor called <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) quantitatively controls the vernalization requirement. By contrast, in cereals, the vernalization response is mainly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by the <i>VERNALIZATION</i> genes, <i>VRN1</i> and <i>VRN2</i>. Here, we characterize <i>ODDSOC2</i>, a recently identified <i>FLC</i> ortholog in monocots, knowing that it belongs to the <i>FLC</i> lineage. By studying its expression in a diverse set of <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions, we find that it is a good predictor of the vernalization requirement. Analyses of transgenics demonstrated that <i>BdODDSOC2</i> functions as a vernalization-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated flowering repressor. In most <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions <i>BdODDSOC2</i> is down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated by cold, and in one of the winter accessions in which this down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation was evident, <i>BdODDSOC2</i> responded to cold before <i>BdVRN1.</i> When stably down-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ated, the mechanism is associated with spreading H3K27me3 modifications at the <i>BdODDSOC2</i> chromatin. Finally, homoeolog-specific gene expression analyses identify <i>TaAGL33</i> and its splice variant <i>TaAGL22</i> as the <i>FLC</i> orthologs in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) behaving most similar to <i>Brachypodium ODDSOC2</i>. Overall, our study suggests that <i>ODDSOC2</i> is not only phylogenetically related to <i>FLC</i> in eudicots but also functions as a flowering repressor in the vernalization pathway of <i>Brachypodium</i> and likely other temperate grasses. These insights could prove useful in breeding efforts to refine the vernalization requirement of temperate cereals and adapt varieties to changing climates.</p>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>atory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 up<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regul</span></strong>ating gap junction remodeling.

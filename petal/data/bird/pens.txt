Local transformations of the hippocampal cognitive map
<p>Grid cells are neurons active in multiple fields arranged in a hexagonal lattice and are thought to represent the “universal metric for space.” However, they become nonhomogeneously distorted in polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enclosur</span></strong>es, which challenges this view. We found that local changes to the configuration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enclosur</span></strong>e induce individual grid fields to shift in a manner inversely related to their distance from the reconfigured boundary. The grid remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling. Shifts in simultaneously recorded colocalized grid fields were strongly correlated, which suggests that the readout of the animal’s position might still be intact. Similar field shifts were also observed in place and boundary cells—albeit of greater magnitude and more pronounced closer to the reconfigured boundary—which suggests that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between these three different cell types.</p>

Atypical septate junctions maintain the somatic enclosure around maturing spermatids and prevent premature sperm release in <i>Drosophila</i> testis
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Septate junctions seal the somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enclosur</span></strong>e around maturing spermatids in <i>Drosophila</i> testis. The junction integrity, maintained by Dlg1 and NrxIV, is essential for keeping the somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enclosur</span></strong>e intact until the mature spermatids are released.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of drought stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enclosur</span></strong>e system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid emission patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid emission rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer drought stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid emission rates towards autumn was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid emission rates and more plastic responses to drought stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of drought, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid emission is more variable than expected and sensitive to drought periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific emission assessment accounting for reduced emission during prolonged (summer) drought is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Wdpcp promotes epicardial EMT and epicardium-derived cell migration to facilitate coronary artery remodeling
<p>During coronary vasculature development, endothelial cells enclose the embryonic heart to form the primitive coronary plexus. This structure is remodeled upon recruitment of epicardial cells that may undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to enable migration and that give rise to smooth muscle cells. In mice expressing a loss-of-function mutant form of <i>Wdpcp</i>, a gene involved in ciliogenesis, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enclosur</span></strong>e of the surface of the heart by the subepicardial coronary plexus was accelerated because of enhanced chemotactic responses to Shh. Coronary arteries, but not coronary veins in <i>Wdpcp</i> mutant mice, showed reduced smooth muscle cell coverage. In addition, <i>Wdpcp</i> mutant hearts had reduced expression of EMT and mesenchymal markers and had fewer epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) that showed impaired migration. Epicardium-specific deletion of <i>Wdpcp</i> recapitulated the coronary artery defect of the <i>Wdpcp</i> mutant. Thus, Wdpcp promotes epithelial EMT and EPDC migration, processes that are required for remodeling of the coronary primitive plexus. The <i>Wdpcp</i> mutant mice will be a useful tool to dissect the molecular mechanisms that govern the remodeling of the primitive plexus during coronary development.</p>

Linking a mutation to survival in wild mice
<p>Adaptive evolution in new or changing environments can be difficult to predict because the functional connections between genotype, phenotype, and fitness are complex. Here, we make these explicit connections by combining field and laboratory experiments in wild mice. We first directly estimate natural selection on pigmentation traits and an underlying pigment locus, <i>Agouti</i>, by using experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enclosur</span></strong>es of mice on different soil colors. Next, we show how a mutation in <i>Agouti</i> associated with survival causes lighter coat color through changes in its protein binding properties. Together, our findings demonstrate how a sequence variant alters phenotype and then reveal the ensuing ecological consequences that drive changes in population allele frequency, thereby illuminating the process of evolution by natural selection.</p>

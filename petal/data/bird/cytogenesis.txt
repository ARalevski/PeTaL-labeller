Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to regenerate bone after fin amputation. In this process, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s do not appear to contribute to repair of bone injuries in mammals; rather, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish bone. Here, we show that de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and skull injuries. In both models, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic fate mapping, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong> de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation in reparative bone formation in fish and indicate that adult fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian bone-forming cells.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation patterns and phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis. Identification of individuals at greatest AF risk could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic data can stratify risk for development of AF, we examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%).

The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>).

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications.

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic oscillator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. We probed centriole amplification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic oscillator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, whereas excessive activity accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic oscillator to uncouple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics and ecology. Here we address how the tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV proteins promote stomatal development and ectopically induce stomata beyond the epidermis
<p>The shoot epidermis of land plants serves as a crucial interface between plants and the atmosphere: pavement cells protect plants from desiccation and other environmental stresses, while stomata facilitate gas exchange and transpiration. Advances have been made in our understanding of stomatal patterning and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, and a set of ‘master regulatory’ transcription factors of stomatal development have been identified. However, they are limited to specifying stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation within the epidermis. Here, we report the identification of an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) protein, HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS2 (HDG2), as a key epidermal component promoting stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. HDG2 is highly enriched in meristemoids, which are transient-amplifying populations of stomatal-cell lineages. Ectopic expression of <i>HDG2</i> confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of stomata in internal mesophyll tissues and occasional multiple epidermal layers. Conversely, a loss-of-function <i>hdg2</i> mutation delays stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and, rarely but consistently, results in aberrant stomata. A closely related <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> gene, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1</i> (<i>AtML1</i>), shares overlapping function with <i>HDG2</i>: <i>AtML1</i> overexpression also triggers ectopic stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation in the mesophyll layer and <i>atml1</i> mutation enhances the stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation defects of <i>hdg2</i>. Consistently, HDG2 and AtML1 bind the same DNA elements, and activate transcription in yeast. Furthermore, HDG2 transactivates expression of genes that regulate stomatal development <i>in planta</i>. Our study highlights the similarities and uniqueness of these two <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> genes in the specification of protodermal identity and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation beyond predetermined tissue layers.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of the observed DEGs using established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical changes through their collective functional influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest.

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. As cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood pressure.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We recently identified 156 proteins in human plasma that were each associated with the net Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score using an aptamer-based proteomic platform in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk reduction in those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05).

Autocrine Wnt regulates the survival and genomic stability of embryonic stem cells
<p>Wnt signaling plays an important role in the self-renewal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of stem cells. The secretion of Wnt ligands requires Evi (also known as Wls). Genetically ablating Evi provides an experimental approach to studying the consequence of depleting all redundant Wnt proteins, and overexpressing Evi enables a nonspecific means of increasing Wnt signaling. We generated Evi-deficient and Evi-overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to analyze the role of autocrine Wnt production in self-renewal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Self-renewal was reduced in Evi-deficient ESCs and increased in Evi-overexpressing ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, which supports the self-renewal of ESCs. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of ESCs into cardiomyocytes was enhanced when Evi was overexpressed and teratoma formation and growth of Evi-deficient ESCs in vivo were impaired, indicating that autocrine Wnt ligands were necessary for ESC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and survival. ESCs lacking autocrine Wnt signaling had mitotic defects and showed genomic instability. Together, our study demonstrates that autocrine Wnt secretion is important for the survival, chromosomal stability, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, and tumorigenic potential of ESCs.</p>

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic drivers for certain cancer types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of cancers. One of the most important observations from this work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic alterations in bona fide cancer drivers (those genes that, when mutated, promote tumorigenesis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver genes appear only in cancers derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of cancer drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums. Here, we discuss the concept of tissue specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic alterations in cancer and provide general hypotheses to help explain this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical phenomenon.</p>

Induction of CD4 T cell memory by local cellular collectivity
<p>Cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is directed by signals driving progenitors into specialized cell types. This process can involve collective decision-making, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating cells determine their lineage choice by interacting with each other. We used live-cell imaging in microwell arrays to study collective processes affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into memory precursors. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of precursor memory T cells sharply increases above a threshold number of locally interacting cells. These homotypic interactions involve the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, which affect memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation orthogonal to their effect on proliferation and survival. Mathematical modeling suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation rate is continuously modulated by the instantaneous number of locally interacting cells. This cellular collectivity can prioritize allocation of immune memory to stronger responses.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

Mitotic transcription and waves of gene reactivation during mitotic exit
<p>Although the genome is generally thought to be transcriptionally silent during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, technical limitations have prevented sensitive mapping of transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit. Thus, the means by which the interphase expression pattern is transduced to daughter cells have been unclear. We used 5-ethynyluridine to pulse-label transcripts during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit and found that many genes exhibit transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, as confirmed with fluorescein isothiocyanate–uridine 5′-triphosphate labeling, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The first round of transcription immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s primarily activates genes involved in the growth and rebuilding of daughter cells, rather than cell type–specific functions. We propose that the cell’s transcription pattern is largely retained at a low level through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, whereas the amplitude of transcription observed in interphase is reestablished during mitotic exit.</p>

Coupling organelle inheritance with mitosis to balance growth and differentiation
<p>Balancing growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is essential to tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. How imbalances arise in disease states is poorly understood. To address this issue, we identified transcripts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed in mouse basal epidermal progenitors versus their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating progeny and those altered in cancers. We used an in vivo RNA interference screen to unveil candidates that altered the equilibrium between the basal proliferative layer and suprabasal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating layers forming the skin barrier. We found that epidermal progenitors deficient in the peroxisome-associated protein Pex11b failed to segregate peroxisomes properly and entered a mitotic delay that perturbed polarized divisions and skewed daughter fates. Together, our findings unveil a role for organelle inheritance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, spindle alignment, and the choice of daughter progenitors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate or remain stem-like.</p>

Asexual Female Gametogenesis Involves Contact with a Sexually-Fated Megaspore in Apomictic <i>Hieracium</i>
<p>Apomixis results in asexual seed formation where progeny are identical to the maternal plant. In ovules of apomictic species of the <i>Hieracium</i> subgenus <i>Pilosella</i>, meiosis of the megaspore mother cell generates four megaspores. Aposporous initial (AI) cells form during meiosis in most ovules. The sexual pathway terminates during functional megaspore (FM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, when an enlarged AI undergoes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to form an aposporous female gametophyte. Then, the mitotically programmed FM dies along with the three other megaspores by unknown mechanisms. Transcriptomes of laser-dissected AIs, ovule cells, and ovaries from apomicts and AI-deficient mutants were analyzed to understand the pathways involved. The steps leading to AI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and sexual pathway termination were determined using antibodies against arabinogalactan protein epitopes found to mark both sexual and aposporous female gametophyte lineages at inception. At most, four AIs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated near developing megaspores. The first expanding AI cell to contact the FM formed a functional AI that underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s soon after megaspore degeneration. Transcriptome analyses indicated that the enlarged, laser-captured AIs were arrested in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and were metabolically active. Further comparisons with AI-deficient mutants showed that AIs were enriched in transcripts encoding homologs of genes involved in, and potentially antagonistic to, known FM specification pathways. We propose that AI and FM cell contact provides cues required for AI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and megaspore degeneration. Specific candidates to further interrogate AI-FM interactions were identified here and include <i>Hieracium</i> arabinogalactan protein family genes.</p>

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated gene expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological development to optimize plant growth and development in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically promoted floral development. Our results also demonstrated the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex development and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem development as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased gene expression on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cascades and gene interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological development and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

Transcription Factors VND1-VND3 Contribute to Cotyledon Xylem Vessel Formation
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN1</i> (<i>VND1</i>) to <i>VND7</i> encode a group of NAC domain transcription factors that function as master regulators of xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. These transcription factors activate the transcription of genes required for secondary cell wall formation and programmed cell death, key events in xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Because constitutive overexpression of VND6 and VND7 induces ectopic xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, functional studies of VND proteins have largely focused on these two proteins. Here, we report the roles of VND1, VND2, and VND3 in xylem vessel formation in cotyledons. Using our newly established in vitro system in which excised Arabidopsis cotyledons are stimulated to undergo xylem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation by cytokinin, auxin, and brassinosteroid treatment, we found that ectopic xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation required VND1, VND2, and VND3 but not VND6 or VND7. The importance of VND1, VND2, and VND3 also was indicated in vivo; in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> seedlings, xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of secondary veins in cotyledons was inhibited under dark conditions. Furthermore, the light responsiveness of <i>VND</i> gene expression was disturbed in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> mutant, and <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> failed to recover lateral root development in response to the change of light conditions. These findings suggest that VND1 to VND3 have specific molecular functions, possibly linking light conditions to xylem vessel formation, during seedling development.</p>

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical transitions, and underlying transcriptional programming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ion and expansion, cell wall thickening, and programmed cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ion and growth, hormone synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phytohormones play crucial roles by promoting cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of hormones at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of hormones in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>y of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Cyst Nematode Parasitism Induces Dynamic Changes in the Root Epigenome
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates that epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic modifications can provide efficient, dynamic, and reversible cellular responses to a wide range of environmental stimuli. However, the significance of epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic modifications in plant-pathogen interactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of epigenome changes during the compatible interaction between the beet cyst nematode <i>Heterodera schachtii</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted to assess the dynamic changes in the methylome of Arabidopsis roots in response to <i>H. schachtii</i> infection. <i>H. schachtii</i> induced widespread hypomethylation of protein-coding genes and transposable elements (TEs), preferentially those adjacent to protein-coding genes. The abundance of 24-nt siRNAs was associated with hypermethylation of TEs and gene promoters, with influence observed for methylation context and infection time points. mRNA sequencing revealed a significant enrichment for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally methylated genes among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes, specifically those with functions corresponding to primary metabolic processes and responses to stimuli. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally methylated genes overlapped with more than one-fourth of the syncytium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes and are of functional significance. Together, our results provide intriguing insights into the potential regulatory role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al DNA methylation in shaping the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical interplay between cyst nematodes and host plants.</p>

Functional Definition of Progenitors Versus Mature Endothelial Cells Reveals Key SoxF-Dependent Differentiation Process
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>During adult life, blood vessel formation is thought to occur via angiogenic processes involving branching from existing vessels.

EVP cells arose from vascular-resident beds that could not be transferred by bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, EVP displayed progenitor-like status with a high proportion of cells in a quiescent cell cycle phase as assessed in wounds, tumors, and aorta. Only EVP cells and not TA and D cells had self-renewal capacity as demonstrated by colony-forming capacity in limiting dilution and by transplantation in Matrigel plugs in recipient mice.

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. We investigated how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation increased cell mitochondrial activity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation was associated with an increase in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mutations in cancer genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic errors in cancer cells that reveal basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from cancer genomes have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

A selfish genetic element confers non-Mendelian inheritance in rice
<p>Selfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic elements are pervasive in eukaryote genomes, but their role remains controversial. We show that <i>qHMS7</i>, a major quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic locus for hybrid male sterility between wild rice (<i>Oryza meridionalis</i>) and Asian cultivated rice (<i>O. sativa</i>), contains two tightly linked genes [<i>Open Reading Frame 2</i> (<i>ORF2</i>) and <i>ORF3</i>]. <i>ORF2</i> encodes a toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic element that aborts pollen in a sporophytic manner, whereas <i>ORF3</i> encodes an antidote that protects pollen in a gametophytic manner. Pollens lacking <i>ORF3</i> are selectively eliminated, leading to segregation distortion in the progeny. Analysis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic sequence suggests that <i>ORF3</i> arose first, followed by gradual functionalization of <i>ORF2</i>. Furthermore, this toxin-antidote system may have promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and/or maintained the genome stability of wild and cultivated rice.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions

We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction network and tested for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions to affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.</p>

Developmental and oncogenic programs in H3K27M gliomas dissected by single-cell RNA-seq
<p>Gliomas with histone H3 lysine27-to-methionine mutations (H3K27M-glioma) arise primarily in the midline of the central nervous system of young children, suggesting a cooperation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics and cellular context in tumorigenesis. Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics of H3K27M-glioma are well characterized, their cellular architecture remains uncharted. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in 3321 cells from six primary H3K27M-glioma and matched models. We found that H3K27M-glioma primarily contain cells that resemble oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC-like), whereas more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated malignant cells are a minority. OPC-like cells exhibit greater proliferation and tumor-propagating potential than their more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated counterparts and are at least in part sustained by <i>PDGFRA</i> signaling.

Silencing stemness in T cell differentiation
<p>Functional diversity in multicellular organisms is achieved through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of stem cells. During this process, stem cells must retain both the capacity for self-renewal and the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate into highly specialized cell types to produce a diverse array of tissues, each with distinct functions and organization. This plasticity is achieved through alterations to the epigenome, heritable and reversible modifications to DNA and histones that affect chromatin structure and gene transcription without altering the DNA sequence itself. Alterations to the epigenome enable cell type–specific transcriptional control that can change dynamically over the life of a cell. Such flexibility and responsiveness are instrumental in directing gene expression changes throughout cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and lineage specification. The acquisition of more specialized functions during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation requires not only that the epigenome turn “on” genes involved in lineage commitment, it also necessitates that genes associated with stemness are simultaneously turned “off” (<i>1</i>). On page 177 of this issue, Pace <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) demonstrate that this phenomenon exists in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, in which epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic repression of stemness-associated genes by the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 is required for T cell effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation.

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We identified five CT-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci related to CT have been identified. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was identified as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci identified here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Common stress genes were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>y and gene expression during dormancy release and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical dormancy in seeds.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic component, that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hered</span></strong>ity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Sara endosomes and the asymmetric division of intestinal stem cells
<p>Tissue homeostasis is maintained by adult stem cells, which self-renew and give rise to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating cells. The generation of daughter cells with different fates is mediated by signalling molecules coming from an external niche or being asymmetrically dispatched between the two daughters upon stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. In the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut, the intestinal stem cell (ISC) divides to generate a new ISC and an enteroblast (EB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating daughter. Notch signalling activity restricted to the EB regulates intestinal cell fate decision. Here, we show that ISCs divide asymmetrically, and Sara endosomes in ISCs are specifically dispatched to the presumptive EB. During ISC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, Notch and Delta traffic through Sara endosomes, thereby contributing to Notch signalling bias, as revealed in Sara mutants: Sara itself contributes to the control of the ISC asymmetric division. Our data uncover an intrinsic endosomal mechanism during ISC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, which participates in the maintenance of the adult intestinal lineage.</p>

The RNA-binding protein ELAV regulates Hox RNA processing, expression and function within the <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system
<p>The regulated head-to-tail expression of Hox genes provides a coordinate system for the activation of specific programmes of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation according to axial level. Recent work indicates that Hox expression can be regulated via RNA processing but the underlying mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of this form of regulation remain poorly understood. Here we explore these issues within the developing <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system (CNS). We show that the pan-neural RNA-binding protein (RBP) ELAV (Hu antigen) regulates the RNA processing patterns of the Hox gene <i>Ultrabithorax</i> (<i>Ubx</i>) within the embryonic CNS. Using a combination of biochemical, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and imaging approaches we demonstrate that ELAV binds to discrete elements within <i>Ubx</i> RNAs and that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic removal reduces Ubx protein expression in the CNS leading to the respecification of cellular subroutines under <i>Ubx</i> control, thus defining for the first time a specific cellular role of ELAV within the developing CNS. Artificial provision of ELAV in glial cells (a cell type that lacks ELAV) promotes Ubx expression, suggesting that ELAV-dependent regulation might contribute to cell type-specific Hox expression patterns within the CNS. Finally, we note that expression of <i>abdominal A</i> and <i>Abdominal B</i> is reduced in <i>elav</i> mutant embryos, whereas other Hox genes (<i>Antennapedia</i>) are not affected. Based on these results and the evolutionary conservation of ELAV and Hox genes we propose that the modulation of Hox RNA processing by ELAV serves to adapt the morphogenesis of the CNS to axial level by regulating Hox expression and consequently activating local programmes of neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation.</p>

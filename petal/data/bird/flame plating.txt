Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in uncemented designs, but may   only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial component fixation   of uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed TKAs <i>versus</i> cemented TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed or cemented TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed component <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the cemented component).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial components of PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial components of cemented TKAs.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

TRPM7 channels mediate spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in growth plate chondrocytes that promote bone development
<p>During endochondral ossification of long bones, the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes cause them to be arranged into layered structures constituting the epiphyseal growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>, where they secrete the cartilage matrix that is subsequently converted into trabecular bone. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been implicated in chondrogenesis in vitro. Through fluorometric imaging of bone slices from embryonic mice, we demonstrated that live growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> chondrocytes generated small, cell-autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations that were associated with weak and intermittent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Several genes encoding Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels were expressed in growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> chondrocytes, but only pharmacological inhibitors of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) reduced the spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations. The TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was likely activated downstream of basal phospholipase C activity and was potentiated upon cell hyperpolarization induced by big-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels. Bones from embryos in which <i>Trpm7</i> was conditionally knocked out during ex vivo culture exhibited reduced outgrowth and displayed histological abnormalities accompanied by insufficient autophosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>. The link between TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations and CaMKII-dependent chondrogenesis was further supported by experiments with chondrocyte-specific <i>Trpm7</i> knockout mice. Thus, growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> chondrocytes generate spontaneous, TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations that promote self-maturation and bone development.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Plate fixation <i>versus</i> intramedullary nailing of completely displaced midshaft fractures of the clavicle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the   functional outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> fixation and elastic stable intramedullary   nailing (ESIN) of completely displaced mid-shaft fractures of the   clavicle in the active adult population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively recruited 123 patients and randomised them to   either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> fixation or ESIN.

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth tem<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation.

We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified.

Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain seasonal camouflage by molting to a white winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling seasonal expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic variation at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

Different effects of pharmacological inhibition emphasize the distinct nature of the assembly and expansion mechanisms characterizing these phases.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

The <i>in vivo</i> effect of a porous titanium alloy flange with hydroxyapatite, silver and fibronectin coatings on soft-tissue integration of intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis (ITAP)   may improve quality of life for amputees by avoiding soft-tissue   complications associated with socket prostheses and by improving   sensory feedback and function.

Stable Casimir equilibria and quantum trapping
<p>The Casimir interaction between two parallel metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s in close proximity is usually thought of as an attractive interaction. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing one object with a low–refractive index thin film, we show that the Casimir interaction between two objects of the same material can be reversed at short distances and preserved at long distances so that two objects can remain without contact at a specific distance. With such a stable Casimir equilibrium, we experimentally demonstrate passive Casimir trapping of an object in the vicinity of another at the nanometer scale, without requiring any external energy input. This stable Casimir equilibrium and quantum trapping can be used as a platform for a variety of applications such as contact-free nanomachines, ultrasensitive force sensors, and nanoscale manipulations.</p>

Low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale deicing
<p>Ice accretion has adverse effects on a range of commercial and residential activities. The force required to remove ice from a surface is typically considered to scale with the iced area. This imparts a scalability limit to the use of icephobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings for structures with large surface areas, such as power lines or ship hulls. We describe a class of materials that exhibit a low interfacial toughness with ice, resulting in systems for which the forces required to remove large areas of ice (a few square centimeters or greater) are both low and independent of the iced area. We further demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings made of such materials allow ice to be shed readily from large areas (~1 square meter) merely by self-weight.</p>

Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared radiation by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed fibers in the textile yarns. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a microbiome during multicellular development; bacteria are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and spores. Bacterial carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds bacteria, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered handling of bacteria also occurs with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from bacteria to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to bacteria to establish the amoebae’s microbiome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular bacteria when presented with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in animals. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence microbiome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

Whispering neurons fuel cortical highways
<p>The mammalian neocortex is one of the most intricate entities found in nature, both in terms of structure and function. It is the brain region responsible for the execution of high-order functions, including sensory perception, motor control, cognition, and speech. Its development is equally complex because it requires that millions to billions (depending on the species) of neurons assemble in distinct layers and connect with exquisite precision to perform complicated information processing operations. During embryonic development, formation of the cerebral cortex involves the migration of excitatory neurons generated in the ventricular zone toward the cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>, where they establish their final position in six well-defined horizontal layers consisting of different types of neurons and architecture. Along this migratory phase, developing neurons undergo a morphological transition from multipolar shape to bipolar morphology. Bipolar neurons exhibit faster locomotion, quickly reaching their final destination. On page 313 of this issue, Ohtaka-Maruyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that this important switch to bipolar neurons is influenced by glutamate release from neurons located at the sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>, just beneath the cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>. Sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> neurons trigger this transformation by making transient synaptic contacts with multipolar neurons in transit to the cortical laminae. Understanding this process is important because disruption of neocortical migration results in several human neuro-developmental diseases.</p>

Self-heating–induced healing of lithium dendrites
<p>Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and stripping invariably leads to growth of dendrites that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery. It is generally accepted that the dendrite problem is exacerbated at high current densities. Here, we report a regime for dendrite evolution in which the reverse is true. In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping current density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive surface migration of Li. This surface diffusion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal surface. We show that repeated doses of high-current-density healing treatment enables the safe cycling of Li-sulfur batteries with high coulombic efficiency.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal color molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> color—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> color, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Titanium isotopic evidence for felsic crust and plate tectonics 3.5 billion years ago
<p>Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevation and chemical composition between the continents and ocean floor. Reconstructing when this dichotomy arose is important for understanding when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> tectonics started and how the supply of nutrients to the oceans changed through time. We measured the titanium isotopic composition of shales to constrain the chemical composition of the continental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform isotopic composition. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal adhesions in order to move. Focal adhesions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative adhesion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated adhesion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell adhesion that, in coordination with focal adhesions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

Recurring and triggered slow-slip events near the trench at the Nankai Trough subduction megathrust
<p>The discovery of slow earthquakes has revolutionized the field of earthquake seismology. Defining the locations of these events and the conditions that favor their occurrence provides important insights into the slip behavior of tectonic faults. We report on a family of recurring slow-slip events (SSEs) on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> interface immediately seaward of repeated historical moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 8 earthquake rupture areas offshore of Japan. The SSEs continue for days to several weeks, include both spontaneous and triggered slip, recur every 8 to 15 months, and are accompanied by swarms of low-frequency tremors. We can explain the SSEs with 1 to 4 centimeters of slip along the megathrust, centered 25 to 35 kilometers (km) from the trench (4 to 10 km depth). The SSEs accommodate 30 to 55% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> motion, indicating frequent release of accumulated strain near the trench.</p>

Release of mineral-bound water prior to subduction tied to shallow seismogenic slip off Sumatra
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>-boundary fault rupture during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman subduction earthquake extended closer to the trench than expected, increasing earthquake and tsunami size. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 362 sampled incoming sediments offshore northern Sumatra, revealing recent release of fresh water within the deep sediments. Thermal modeling links this freshening to amorphous silica dehydration driven by rapid burial-induced temperature increases in the past 9 million years. Complete dehydration of silicates is expected before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> subduction, contrasting with prevailing models for subduction seismogenesis calling for fluid production during subduction. Shallow slip offshore Sumatra appears driven by diagenetic strengthening of deeply buried fault-forming sediments, contrasting with weakening proposed for the shallow Tohoku-Oki 2011 rupture, but our results are applicable to other thickly sedimented subduction zones including those with limited earthquake records.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle

Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

A Silurian maxillate placoderm illuminates jaw evolution

Tomography reveals buoyant asthenosphere accumulating beneath the Juan de Fuca plate
<p>The boundary between Earth’s strong lithospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s and the underlying mantle asthenosphere corresponds to an abrupt seismic velocity decrease and electrical conductivity increase with depth, perhaps indicating a thin, weak layer that may strongly influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> motion dynamics. The behavior of such a layer at subduction zones remains unexplored. We present a tomographic model, derived from on- and offshore seismic experiments, that reveals a strong low-velocity feature beneath the subducting Juan de Fuca slab along the entire Cascadia subduction zone. Through simple geodynamic arguments, we propose that this low-velocity feature is the accumulation of material from a thin, weak, buoyant layer present beneath the entire oceanic lithosphere. The presence of this feature could have major implications for our understanding of the asthenosphere and subduction zone dynamics.</p>

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during seed set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin composition is affected by temperature during seed maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

The use of an anterior pelvic internal fixator to treat disruptions of the anterior pelvic ring
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator is increasingly used for   the treatment of unstable, or displaced, injuries of the anterior   pelvic ring. The evidence for its use, however, is limited. The   aim of this paper is to describe the indications for its use, how   it is applied and its complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the case notes and radiographs of 50 patients treated   with an anterior pelvic internal fixator between April 2010 and   December 2015 at a major trauma centre in the United Kingdom. The   median follow-up time was 38 months (interquartile range 24 to 51).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three patients were excluded from the analysis leaving 47 patients   with complete follow-up data. Of the 47 patients, 46 achieved radiological   union and one progressed to an asymptomatic nonunion. Of the remaining patients,   45 required supplementary posterior fixation with percutaneous iliosacral   screws, 2 of which required sacral plating. The incidence of injury   to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) was 34%. The rate   of infection was 2%. There were no other significant complications.   Without this treatment, 44 patients (94%) would have needed unilateral   or bilateral open reduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> fixation extending laterally   to the hip joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator reduces the need for extensive   open surgery and is a useful addition to the armamentarium for the   treatment of anterior pelvic injuries.

Computer hexapod-assisted orthopaedic surgery provides a predictable and safe method of femoral deformity correction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Computer hexapod assisted orthopaedic surgery (CHAOS), is a method   to achieve the intra-operative correction of long bone deformities   using a hexapod external fixator before definitive internal fixation   with minimally invasive stabilisation techniques.</p><p>The aims of this study were to determine the reliability of this   method in a consecutive case series of patients undergoing femoral   deformity correction, with a minimum six-month follow-up, to assess   the complications and to define the ideal group of patients for   whom this treatment is appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The medical records and radiographs of all patients who underwent   CHAOS for femoral deformity at our institution between 2005 and   2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Records were available for all   55 consecutive procedures undertaken in 49 patients with a mean   age of 35.6 years (10.9 to 75.3) at the time of surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients were assessed at a mean interval of 44 months (6 to   90) following surgery. The indications were broad; the most common   were vitamin D resistant rickets (n = 10), growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> arrest (n   = 6) and post-traumatic deformity (n = 20).</p><p>Multi-planar correction was required in 33 cases. A single level   osteotomy was performed in 43 cases.

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong> tissue.</p>

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix gel substantially improved long-term survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and vessel-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery. This laboratory   study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic antibacterial   properties against planktonic bacteria, or the ability to inhibit   biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components   were sterilised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either <i>Staphylococcus   (S.) aureus</i> or <i>S. epidermidis</i> for 24 hours.   After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified   on Mueller-Hinton agar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s. In order to establish whether biofilms   formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these   Ta and Ti pieces were then washed twice, sonicated and washed again   to remove loosely adhered planktonic bacteria. They were then re-incubated   for 24 hours prior to quantifying the number of cfu. All experiments   were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>More than 1x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml were observed in both the Ta   and Ti experiments.

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plate</span></strong>s (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Fracture   classification and operative information including weight-bearing   status, rates of union, re-operation, failure of implants and mortality   rate, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The   mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%)   were female. A consultant performed the operation in 85 of the cases,   (67%) with the remainder performed under direct consultant supervision.   In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to bear full weight immediately.   The rate of clinical and radiological union was 81/85 (95%) and   only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-operation   for failure of surgery. The 30-day, three- and 12-month mortality   rates were 6 (5%), 17 (15%) and 25 (22%), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study suggests an exponential increase in the incidence of   a fracture of the distal femur with age, analogous to the population   suffering from a proximal femoral fracture.

Pelvic reconstruction following resection of malignant bone tumours using a stemmed acetabular pedestal cup
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Pelvic reconstruction after the resection of a tumour around   the acetabulum is a challenging procedure due to the complex anatomy   and biomechanics. Several pelvic endoprostheses have been introduced,   but the rates of complication remain high. Our aim was to review   the use of a stemmed acetabular pedestal cup in the management of   these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 48 patients who underwent periacetabular reconstruction   using a stemmed pedestal cup (Schoellner cup; Zimmer Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana) between 2000 and 2013. The indications for treatment included   a primary bone tumour in 27 patients and metastatic disease in 21   patients. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was   52 years (16 to 83).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a median follow-up of 6.6 years (95% confidence interval 4.6   to 8.2), local control was achieved in all patients; 19 patients   had died (16 of disease). Complications occurred in 19 patients   (40%), of which deep infection was the most common, affecting eight   patients (17%). Seven patients (15%) had a dislocation of the hip.   Aseptic loosening was found in three patients (6%). Two (4%) underwent   hindquarter amputation for non-oncological reasons. The risk of   revision, with death being treated as a competing event, was 28%   at one year, 39% at five years and 48% at ten years post-operatively.   The mean Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score at final follow-up   was 71% (27% to 93%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This type of reconstruction is a satisfactory option for the   treatment of patients with a periacetabular tumour.

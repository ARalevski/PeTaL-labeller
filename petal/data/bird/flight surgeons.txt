Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the proximal humerus for the primary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong> decide whether to preserve the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the proximal humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat rim separating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   fat rim on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour.   A smaller tumour, the presence of a continuous fat rim and the identification   of the axillary nerve on pre-operative MRI will persuade <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s   to opt for a deltoid resecting procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1244–9.</p></sec>

Correcting severe valgus deformity
<p>Valgus knee deformity can present a number of   unique surgical challenges for the total knee arthroplasty (TKA)   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>. Understanding the typical patterns of bone and soft-tissue pathology   in the valgus arthritic knee is critical for appropriate surgical   planning. This review aims to provide the knee arthroplasty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>   with an understanding of surgical management strategies for the   treatment of valgus knee arthritis.</p><p>Lateral femoral and tibial deficiencies, contracted lateral soft   tissues, attenuated medial soft tissues, and multiplanar deformities   may all be present in the valgus arthritic knee. A number of classifications   have been reported in order to guide surgical management, and a variety   of surgical strategies have been described with satisfactory clinical   results. Depending on the severity of the deformity, a variety of   TKA implant designs may be appropriate for use.</p><p>Regardless of an operating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>’s preferred surgical strategy,   adherence to a step-wise approach to deformity correction is advised.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):60–4.</p>

Factors affecting the rate of surgical site infection in patients after hemiarthroplasty of the hip following a fracture of the neck of the femur
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Surgical site infection can be a devastating complication of   hemiarthroplasty of the hip, when performed in elderly patients   with a displaced fracture of the femoral neck. It results in a prolonged   stay in hospital, a poor outcome and increased costs. Many studies   have identified risk and prognostic factors for deep infection.   However, most have combined the rates of infection following total   hip arthroplasty and internal fixation as well as hemiarthroplasty, despite   the fact that they are different entities. The aim of this study   was to clarify the risk and prognostic factors causing deep infection   after hemiarthroplasty alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from a prospective hip fracture database   and completed by retrospective review of the hospital records. A   total of 916 patients undergoing a hemiarthroplasty in two level   II trauma teaching hospitals between 01 January 2011 and    01 May 2016 were included. We analysed the potential peri-operative   risk factors with univariable and multivariable logistic regression   analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 92 patients (10%) had a surgical site infection, and   44 (4.9%) developed a deep infection. After univariable analyses,   the multivariable model showed that the level of experience of the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong> measured by the number of hemiarthroplasties performed per   year was a significant prognostic factor (odds ratio (OR) 0.93,   p = 0.042) for the development of an infection. Secondly, the development   of a haematoma (OR 9.6, p < 0.001), a re-operation (OR 4.7, p   = 0.004) and an operating time of < 45 mins (OR 5.1, p = 0.002)   or    > 90 mins (OR 2.7, p = 0.034) were also significant factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a significant association between the experience of   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong> and the rate of deep infection. Secondly, a haematoma,   a re-operation and both shorter and longer operating times were   associated with an increased risk of deep infection after hemiarthroplasty.   No association was found between deep infection and the anatomical approach,   the time when surgery was undertaken and the use of a drain.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1088–94.</p></sec>

Pre-operative functional status as a predictor of morbidity and mortality after elective cervical spine surgery
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients seeking cervical spine surgery are thought to be increasing   in age, comorbidities and functional debilitation. The changing   demographics of this population may significantly impact the outcomes   of their care, specifically with regards to complications. In this   study, our goals were to determine the rates of functionally dependent   patients undergoing elective cervical spine procedures and to assess   the effect of functional dependence on 30-day morbidity and mortality   using a large, validated national cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective analysis of the American College of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s   National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data files from 2006   to 2013 was conducted to identify patients undergoing common cervical   spine procedures. Multivariate logistic regression models were generated   to analyse the independent association of functional dependence   with 30-day outcomes of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with lower functional status had significantly higher   rates of medical comorbidities. Even after accounting for these   comorbidities, type of procedure and pre-operative diagnosis, analyses   demonstrated that functional dependence was independently associated   with significantly increased odds of sepsis (odds ratio (OR) 5.04), pulmonary   (OR 4.61), renal (OR 3.33) and cardiac complications (OR 4.35) as   well as mortality (OR 11.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Spine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s should be aware of the inherent risks of these   procedures with the functionally dependent patient population when   deciding on whether to perform cervical spine surgery, delivering   pre-operative patient counselling, and providing peri-operative   management and surveillance.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:824–8.</p></sec>

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the mean SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-open group (91% of mini-open repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; mean SST score 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-open group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-open   group (mean ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-open group;   mean 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-open repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients.

Practice patterns in the care of acute Achilles tendon ruptures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine whether the findings from a landmark Canadian trial   assessing the optimal management of acute rupture of the Achilles   tendon influenced the practice patterns of orthopaedic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s   in Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Health administrative databases were used to identify Ontario   residents ≥ 18 years of age with an Achilles tendon rupture from   April 2002 to March 2014. The rate of surgical repair (per 100 cases)   was calculated for each calendar quarter. A time-series analysis   was used to determine whether changes in the rate were chronologically   related to the dissemination of results from a landmark trial published   in February 2009. Non-linear spline regression was then used independently   to identify critical time-points of change in the surgical repair   rate to confirm the findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 29 531 patients sustained an Achilles tendon rupture   during the study period. Consistently, around 21 out of every 100   cases underwent surgical repair up to the first quarter of 2010.   However, by the first quarter of 2014, only 6.5 cases per 100 had   surgery. A statistically significant decrease in the rate of surgical   repair was observed within one year of the presentation of landmark   trial results in 2009 (p < 0.001). July 2009 was independently identified   as a critical time at which the surgical repair rate began to significantly   decline (p < 0.001).

Mid-term results of lateral unicondylar mobile bearing knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this independent multicentre study was to assess the   mid-term results of mobile bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty   (UKA) for isolated lateral osteoarthritis of the knee joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 363 consecutive, lateral UKAs (346   patients) performed using the Oxford domed lateral prosthesis undertaken   in three high-volume knee arthroplasty centres between 2006 and   2014. Mean age of the patients at surgery was 65 years (36 to 88)   with a mean final follow-up of 37 months (12 to 93)</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 (10.5%) patients underwent revision surgery, giving   a survival rate of 90.1% at three years (95% confidence intervals   (CI) 86.1 to 93.1; number at risk: 155) and 85.0% at five years   (95% CI 77.9 to 89.9; number at risk: 43). Dislocation of the mobile   bearing occurred in 18 patients (5.6%) at three years (95% CI 1.0   to 16.4; number at risk: 154) and in 20 patients (8.5%) at five   years (95% CI 1.0 to 27.0; number at risk: 42).

Aortic Cross-Sectional Area/Height Ratio and Outcomes in Patients With a Trileaflet Aortic Valve and a Dilated Aorta
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In patients with a dilated proximal ascending aorta and trileaflet aortic valve, we aimed to assess (1) factors independently associated with increased long-term mortality and (2) the incremental prognostic utility of indexing aortic root to patient height.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied consecutive patients with a dilated aortic root (≥4 cm) that underwent echocardiography and gated contrast-enhanced thoracic aortic computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography between 2003 and 2007. A ratio of aortic root area over height was calculated (cm<sup>2</sup>/m) on tomography, and a cutoff of 10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m was chosen as abnormal, on the basis of previous reports. All-cause death was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cohort comprised 771 patients (63 years [interquartile range, 53–71], 87% men, 85% hypertension, 51% hyperlipidemia, 56% smokers). Inherited aortopathies, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and severe aortic stenosis were seen in 7%, 18%, and 2%, whereas 91% and 54% were on β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively. Aortic root area/height ratio was ≥10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m in 24%. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and right ventricular systolic pressure were 3.3±3 and 31±7 mm Hg, respectively. At 7.8 years (interquartile range, 6.6–8.9), 280 (36%) patients underwent aortic surgery (76% within 1 year) and 130 (17%) died (1% in-hospital postoperative mortality). A lower proportion of patients in the surgical (versus nonsurgical) group died (13% versus 19%, <i>P</i><0.01). On multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, aortic root area/height ratio (hazard ratio, 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.69–6.231) was associated with death, whereas aortic surgery (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27–0.81) was associated with improved survival (both <i>P</i><0.01). For longer-term mortality, the addition of aortic root area/height ratio ≥10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m to a clinical model (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, inherited aortopathies, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, medications, aortic regurgitation, and right ventricular systolic pressure), increased the c-statistic from 0.57 (95% CI, 0.35–0.77) to 0.65 (95% CI, 0.52–0.73) and net reclassification index from 0.17 (95% CI, 0.02–0.31) to 0.23 (95% CI, 0.04–0.34), both <i>P</i><0.01. Of the 327 patients with aortic root diameter between 4.5 and 5.5 cm, 44% had an abnormal aortic root area/height ratio, of which 78% died.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with dilated aortic root and trileaflet aortic valve, a ratio of aortic root area to height provides independent and improved stratification for prediction of death.</p></sec>

Effect of pre-operative expectations on the outcomes following total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Few studies have evaluated the relationship between patients’   pre-operative expectations and the outcome of orthopaedic procedures.   Our aim was to determine the effect of expectations on the outcome   after primary anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). We hypothesised   that patients with greater expectations would have better outcomes. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients undergoing primary anatomical TSA completed the Hospital   for Special Surgery’s Shoulder Expectations Survey pre-operatively.   The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Shoulder Activity   Scale (SAS), Short-Form-36 (SF-36), and visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain, fatigue, and general health scores were also collected   pre-operatively and two years post-operatively. Pearson correlations   were used to assess the relationship between the number of expectations   and the outcomes. Differences in outcomes between those with higher   and lower levels of expectations for each expectation were assessed   by independent samples <i>t</i>-test. Multivariable linear   regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding   factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 67 patients were evaluated two years post-operatively.   Most parameters of outcome improved significantly from baseline   and most patients were satisfied. A greater number of expectations   was associated with a significantly greater improvement in the ASES   score (p = 0.02). In the multivariable analysis, a greater number   of expectations was an independent predictor of better ASES, VAS   and SF-36 scores, as well as improvements in ASES and VAS pain scores   (p < 0.05). Greater expectations for many specific expectation   questions were significantly associated with better outcomes (p   < 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA is a successful procedure with significant improvements in   outcome, and greater    pre-operative expectations are associated with better outcomes. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1190–6.</p></sec>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform.

The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), ceramic-on-ceramic revision bearings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07). These four factors remained predictive   of re-revision when the missing data were imputed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The short-term risk of re-revision following MoMHA revision surgery   performed for ARMD was comparable with that reported in the NJR   following all-cause non-MoMHA revision surgery. However, the factors   predictive of re-revision included those which could be modified   by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>, suggesting that rates of failure following ARMD revision   may be reduced further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1020–7.</p></sec>

Radiation reduction of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with localisation system in overweight patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MITLIF)   has been well validated in overweight and obese patients who are   consequently subject to a higher radiation exposure. This prospective   multicentre study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel lumbar   localisation system for MITLIF in overweight patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The initial study group consisted of 175 patients. After excluding   49 patients for various reasons, 126 patients were divided into   two groups. Those in Group A were treated using the localisation   system while those in Group B were treated by conventional means.   The primary outcomes were the effective radiation dosage to the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong> and the exposure time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 62 patients in Group A and 64 in Group B. The mean   effective dosage was 0.0217 mSv (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 0.0079)   in Group A and 0.0383 mSv (<sc>sd</sc> 0.0104) in Group B (p < 0.001).   The mean fluoroscopy exposure time was 26.42 seconds (<sc>sd</sc> 5.91)   in Group A and 40.67 seconds (<sc>sd</sc> 8.18) in Group B (p <   0.001). The operating time was 175.56 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 32.23)   and 206.08 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 30.15) (p < 0.001), respectively.   The mean pre-operative localisation time was 4.73 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 0.84)   in Group A and 7.03 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 1.51) in Group B (p <   0.001).

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This information can be used in the surgical planning   and operative reconstruction of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a fracture of the proximal humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

Recurrence of frozen shoulder after manipulation under anaesthetic (MUA)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Manipulation under anaesthetic (MUA) is a recognised form of   treatment for patients with a frozen shoulder. However, not all   patients benefit. Some have persistent or recurrent symptoms. There   are no clear recommendations in the literature on the optimal management   of recurrent frozen shoulder after a MUA. We aimed to address this   issue in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed a prospectively collected, single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>, consecutive   series of patients who underwent MUA for frozen shoulder between   January 1999 and December 2015. The Oxford Shoulder Scores (OSS)   and range of movement were the outcome measures. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 730 patients (792 shoulders) underwent MUA during   the study period. A further MUA was undertaken in 141 shoulders   (17.8%), for which we had complete data for 126. The mean improvement   in OSS for all patients undergoing MUA was 16 (26 to 42), and the   mean post-operative OSS in those requiring a further MUA was 14   (28 to 42; <i>t</i>-test, no difference between mean improvements,   p = 0.57). Improvement was seen after a further MUA, regardless   both of the outcome of the initial MUA, and of the time of recurrence.   Patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus were at a 38% increased risk   of requiring a further MUA, compared with the 18% increased risk   of the group as a whole (p < 0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with a poor outcome or recurrent symptoms of a frozen   shoulder after a MUA should be offered a further MUA with the expectation   of a good outcome and a low complication rate.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:812–17.</p></sec>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial force ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of force occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial force ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial force ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with exchangeable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   reported an increased rate of revision after primary THA using femoral   stems with an exchangeable neck. The aim of this study was to provide   a more comprehensive up-to-date analysis of primary THA using femoral   stems with exchangeable and fixed necks.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The data included all primary THA procedures performed for osteoarthritis   (OA), reported to the AOANJRR between 01 September 1999 and 31 December   2014. There were 9289 femoral stems with an exchangeable neck and   253 165 femoral stems with a fixed neck. The characteristics of   the patients and prostheses including the bearing surface and stem/neck   metal combinations were examined using Cox proportional hazard ratios   (HRs) and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was found that prostheses with an exchangeable neck had a   higher rate of revision and this was evident regardless of the bearing   surface or the size of the femoral head. Exchangeable neck prostheses   with a titanium stem and a cobalt-chromium neck had a significantly   higher rate of revision compared with titanium stem/titanium neck   combinations (HR 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.23, p <   0.001). Revisions were higher for these combinations compared with   femoral stems with a fixed neck.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>There appears to be little evidence to support the continued   use of prostheses with an exchangeable neck in primary THA undertaken   for OA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:766–73.</p></sec>

Early migration of a partially cemented fluted glenoid component inserted using a cannulated preparation system
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) allows an extremely accurate   measurement of early micromotion of components following arthroplasty. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this study, RSA was used to measure the migration of 11 partially   cemented fluted pegged glenoid components in patients with osteoarthritis   who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty using an improved surgical   technique (seven men, four women, mean age 68). Patients were evaluated   clinically using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES)   and Constant-Murley scores and by CT scans two years post-operatively. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were two patterns of migration, the first showing little,   if any, migration and the second showing rotation by > 6° as early   as three months post-operatively. At two years, these two groups   could be confirmed on CT scans, one with osseointegration around   the central peg, and the second with cystic changes. Patients with   osteolysis around the central peg were those with early migration   and those with osseointegration had minimal early migration. Both groups,however,had   similar clinical results. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rapid early migration associated with focal lucency and absence   of osseointegration was observed in three of 11 glenoid components,   suggesting that lack of initial stability leads to early movement   and failure of osseointegration.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:674–9.</p></sec>

Five-year clinical and radiological outcomes in 257 consecutive cementless Oxford medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to examine the clinical and radiographic outcomes   in 257 consecutive Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (OUKAs)   (238 patients), five years post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective evaluation was undertaken of patients treated   between April 2008 and October 2010 in a regional centre by two   non-designing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s with no previous experience of UKAs. The   Oxford Knee Scores (OKSs) were recorded and fluoroscopically aligned   radiographs were assessed post-operatively at one and five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median age of the 238 patients was 65.0 years (interquartile   range (IQR) 59.0 to 73.0), the median body mas index was 30.0 (IQR   27.5 to 33.0) and 51.7% were male.

The evolution of fracture clinic design
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fracture clinics are often characterised by the referral of large   numbers of unselected patients with minor injuries not requiring   investigation or intervention, long waiting times and recurrent   unnecessary reviews. Our experience had been of an unsustainable   system and we implemented a ‘Trauma Triage Clinic’ (TTC) in order   to rationalise and regulate access to our fracture service. The   British Orthopaedic Association’s guidelines have required a prospective evaluation   of this change of practice, and we report our experience and results.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We review the management of all 12 069 patients referred to our   service in the calendar year 2014, with a minimum of one year follow-up   during the calendar year 2015. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following the successful introduction of the TTC, only 2836 patients   (23.5%) who would previously have been reviewed in the general fracture   clinic were brought back to such a clinic to be seen by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>.   An additional 2366 patients (19.6%) were brought back to a sub-specialist   injury-specific clinic. Another 2776 patients (23%) with relatively   predictable injuries were reviewed by a nurse practitioner according   to an established protocol or specific consultant instructions.

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   risk factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-tapered   cementless femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   identified. Level of pre-operative osteoarthritis, femoral Dorr   type and cortical index were recorded. Varus/valgus placement of   the stem and canal fill ratio were recorded post-operatively. Periprosthetic   fractures were identified and classified according to the Vancouver   classification. Regression analysis was performed to identify risk   factors for early periprosthetic fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 713 days (1 to 2058). A total of 48 periprosthetic   fractures (3.0%) were identified during the follow-up and median   time until fracture was 16 days, (interquartile range 10 to 31.5).   Patients with femoral Dorr type C had a 5.2 times increased risk   of post-operative periprosthetic fracture compared with type B,   while female patients had a near significant two times increased   risk over time for post-operative fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dorr type C is an independent risk factor for early periprosthetic   fracture, following THA using a double tapered cementless stem such   as the Bi-Metric.

Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong> between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and modes of failure. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64). There   were 64 Mode 1 failures (6.3%) at a mean of 3.2 years following   JPSH with a mean patient age of 46.8 years (18 to 64). There were   17 Mode 2 failures (1.7%) at a mean of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a mean patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 Mode 3 failures (1.9%) at a mean of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a mean patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO). There were 4   Mode 4 failures (0.4%) at a mean of 1.8 years post-JPSH with a mean   patient age of 31.5 years (15 to 43). Using the modified Dindo-Clavien   classification system, the overall complication rate among JPSHs   was 4.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While defining the overall re-operation and complication rates,   it is important to define the safety and effectiveness of JPSH.   Standardisation of the modes of failure may help identify the best   practice. Application of these modes to large clinical series, such   as registries, will assist in further establishing how to improve   the efficacy of JPSH.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:303–9.</p></sec>

Custom-made total ankle arthroplasty for the salvage of major talar bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A failed total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is often associated with   much bone loss. As an alternative to arthrodesis, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong> may   consider a custom-made talar component to compensate for the bone   loss. Our aim in this study was to assess the functional and radiological   outcome after the use of such a component at mid- to long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 12 patients (five women and seven men, mean age 53   years; 36 to77) with a failed TAA and a large talar defect underwent   a revision procedure using a custom-made talar component. The design   of the custom-made components was based on CT scans and standard   radiographs, when compared with the contralateral ankle. After the   anterior talocalcaneal joint was fused, the talar component was   introduced and fixed to the body of the calcaneum.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (1 to 13), 11 ankles were stable   with no radiological evidence of loosening. Only one was lost to   follow-up. The mean arc of movement was 21<sup>°</sup> (10<sup>°</sup> to   35<sup>°</sup>). A total of nine patients (75%) were satisfied or   very satisfied with the outcome, two (17%) were satisfied but with   reservations and one (8%) was not satisfied. All but one patient   had an improvement in the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society   hindfoot score (p = 0.01). Just one patient developed deep infection,   leading to arthrodesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A custom-made talar component yielded satisfactory results with   regard to function, stability and satisfaction.

Periprosthetic femoral fractures and trying to avoid them
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) following total hip arthroplasty   (THA) are devastating complications that are associated with functional   limitations and increased overall mortality. Although cementless   implants have been associated with an increased risk of PFF, the   precise contribution of implant geometry and design on the risk   of both intra-operative and post-operative PFF remains poorly investigated.   A systematic review was performed to aggregate all of the PFF literature   with specific attention to the femoral implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A systematic search strategy of several journal databases and   recent proceedings from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons   was performed. Clinical articles were included for analysis if sufficient   implant description was provided. All articles were reviewed by   two reviewers. A review of fundamental investigations of implant   load-to-failure was performed, with the intent of identifying similar   conclusions from the clinical and fundamental literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 596 articles were initially identified, with 34 being   eligible for analysis. Aggregate analysis of 1691 PFFs in 342 719   primary THAs revealed a significantly higher number of PFFs with   cementless femoral implants (p < 0.001). Single-wedge and double-wedge   (fit-and-fill) femoral implants were associated with a threefold   increase in PFF rates (p < 0.001) compared with anatomical, fully   coated and tapered/rounded stems. Within cemented stems, loaded-taper   (Exeter) stems were associated with more PFFs than composite-beam   (Charnley) stems (p = 0.004). Review of the fundamental literature   revealed very few studies comparing cementless component designs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Very few studies within the PFF literature provide detailed implant   information. Cementless implants, specifically those of single-wedge   and double-wedge, have the highest PFF rates in the literature,   with most investigations recommending against their use in older   patients with osteoporotic bone. This review illustrates the need   for registries and future PFF studies to record implant name and   information for future analysis. Furthermore, future biomechanical   investigations comparing modern implants are needed to clarify the   precise contribution of implant design to PFF risk.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):50–9.</p></sec>

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with open repair of the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to open surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-operatively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-operatively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for open surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-tear was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for open surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256). Healed repairs had the most improved OSS. These   findings were the same when analysed per-protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no evidence of difference in effectiveness between open   and arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears. The rate of re-tear   is high in both groups, for all sizes of tear and ages and this   adversely affects the outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:107–15.</p></sec>

The impact of age on major orthopaedic trauma
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the early management and mortality of older patients   sustaining major orthopaedic trauma with that of a younger population   with similar injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Trauma Audit Research Network database was reviewed to identify   eligible patients admitted between April 2012 and June 2015. Distribution   and severity of injury, interventions, comorbidity, critical care   episodes and mortality were recorded. The population was divided   into young (64 years or younger) and older (65 years and older) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 142 765 adults sustaining major trauma, 72 942 (51.09 %) had   long bone or pelvic fractures and 45.81% of these were > 65 years   old. Road traffic collision was the most common mechanism in the   young (40.4%) and, in older people, fall from standing height (80.4%)   predominated. The 30 day mortality in older patients with fractures   is greater (6.8% <i>versus</i> 2.5%), although critical   care episodes are more common in the young (18.2% <i>versus</i> 9.7%).   Older people are less likely to be admitted to critical care beds   and are often managed in isolation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s. Orthopaedic surgery   is the most common admitting and operating specialty and, in older   people, fracture surgery accounted for 82.1% of procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Orthopaedic trauma in older people is associated with mortality   that is significantly greater than for similar fractures in the   young. As with the hip fracture population, major trauma in the   elderly is a growing concern which highlights the need for a review   of admission pathways and shared orthogeriatric care models. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1677–80.</p></sec>

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a mean follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-operative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   operating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong> between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a mean age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a mean body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The curves were classified according to Lenke; 40 curves were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-operatively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-operatively with   a mean correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001). The mean   kyphosis at T5 to T12 increased from 24.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.2°) pre-operatively   to 30.1° (<sc>sd</sc> 9.6°,    p < 0.001) post-operatively. Peri-operative (30 days) complications   occurred in three patients(4.2%): one subcutaneous haematoma, one   deep venous thrombosis and one pulmonary complication. Five additional complications   occurred in five patients (7.1%): one superficial wound infection,   one suture granuloma and three delayed deep surgical site infections.   The mean ORT was 337.1 mins (<sc>sd</sc> 121.3); the mean EBL was   345.7 ml (<sc>sd</sc> 175.1) and the mean LOS was 4.6 days (<sc>sd</sc> 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of MIS for patients with AIS results in a significant   correction of spinal deformity in both the frontal and sagittal   planes, with a low EBL and a short LOS. The rate of peri-operative   complications compares well with that following a routine open technique.   The longer term safety and benefit of MIS in these patients needs   to be evaluated with further follow-up of a larger cohort of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1651–7.</p></sec>

An analysis of 30-day mortality after weekend <i>versus</i> weekday elective joint arthroplasty in England and Wales
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate whether elective joint arthroplasty performed   at the weekend is associated with a different 30-day mortality <i>versus</i> that   performed between Monday and Friday.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We examined the 30-day cumulative mortality rate (Kaplan-Meier)   for all elective hip and knee arthroplasties performed in England   and Wales between 1st April 2003 and 31st December 2014, comprising   118 096 episodes undertaken at the weekend and 1 233 882 episodes   performed on a weekday.

A positive bacterial culture during re-implantation is associated with a poor outcome in two-stage exchange arthroplasty for deep infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of positive   cultures during the second stage of a two-stage revision arthroplasty   and to analyse the association between positive cultures and an   infection-free outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This single-centre retrospective review of prospectively collected   data included patients with a periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   of either the hip or the knee between 2013 and 2015, who were treated   using a standardised diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm with two-stage   exchange. Failure of treatment was assessed according to a definition   determined by a Delphi-based consensus. Logistic regression analysis   was performed to assess the predictors of positive culture and risk   factors for failure. The mean follow-up was 33 months (24 to 48).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 163 two-stage revision arthroplasties involving 84   total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and 79 total knee arthroplasties   (TKAs) were reviewed.

The same initially infecting organism was isolated at re-implantation   in nine of 27 patients (33.3%). The organism causing re-infection   in none of the patients was the same as that isolated at re-implantation.   The risk of the failure of treatment was significantly higher in   patients with a positive culture (odds ratio (OR) 1.7; 95% confidence   interval (CI) 1.0 to 3.0; p = 0.049) and in patients with a higher   Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.6 to 1.8; p = 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Positive culture at re-implantation was independently associated   with subsequent failure.

Metaphyseal debonding of the Corail collarless cementless stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Corail stem has good long-term results. After four years   of using this stem, we have detected a small group of patients who   have presented with symptomatic metaphyseal debonding.

Is limb salvage surgery safe for bone sarcomas identified after a previous surgical procedure?
<p>Bone sarcomas are rare cancers and orthopaedic   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s come across them infrequently, sometimes unexpectedly during   surgical procedures. We investigated the outcomes of patients who   underwent a surgical procedure where sarcomas were found unexpectedly   and were subsequently referred to our unit for treatment. We identified   95 patients (44 intra-lesional excisions, 35 fracture fixations,   16 joint replacements) with mean age of 48 years (11 to 83); 60%   were males (n = 57). Local recurrence arose in 40% who underwent   limb salvage surgery <i>versus</i> 12% who had an amputation.   Despite achieving local control, overall survival was worse for   patients treated with amputation rather than limb salvage (54% <i>vs</i> 75%   five-year survival). Factors that negatively influenced survival   were invasive primary surgery (fracture fixation, joint replacement),   a delay of greater than two months until referral to our oncology   service, and high-grade tumours. Survival in these circumstances   depends mostly on factors that are determined prior to definitive   treatment by a tertiary orthopaedic oncology unit. Limb salvage   in this group of patients is associated with a higher rate of inadequate   marginal surgery and, consequently, higher local recurrence rates   than amputation, but should still be attempted whenever possible,   as local control is not the primary determinant of survival. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:665–72.</p>

Intra-operative digital imaging
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to examine the rate at which the   positioning of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy   and femoral offset are outside an acceptable range in total hip   arthroplasties (THAs) which either do or do not involve the use   of intra-operative digital imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective case-control study was undertaken with 50 patients   before and 50 patients after the integration of an intra-operative   digital imaging system in THA. The demographics of the two groups   were comparable for body mass index, age, laterality and the indication   for surgery. The digital imaging group had more men than the group without.   Surgical data and radiographic parameters, including the inclination   and anteversion of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy,   and the difference in femoral offset compared with the contralateral   hip were collected and compared, as well as the incidence of altering   the position of a component based on the intra-operative image.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Digital imaging took a mean of five minutes (2.3 to 14.6) to   perform. Intra-operative changes with the use of digital imaging   were made for 43 patients (86%), most commonly to adjust leg length   and femoral offset. There was a decrease in the incidence of outliers   when using intra-operative imaging compared with not using it in   regard to leg length discrepancy (20% <i>versus</i> 52%,   p = 0.001) and femoral offset inequality (18% <i>versus</i> 44%,   p = 0.004).

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical Evaluation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were evaluated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not different. This was also not significant when evaluating each valve type separately. Similarly, there were no differences for aortic valve area >1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> or <1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> and for Doppler velocity index >0.35 or <0.35 (all <i>P</i>=not significant).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lotus had significantly greater freedom from moderate or severe paravalvular leak and smaller valve area and higher gradients than CoreValve. The hemodynamic differences were not associated with any clinical differences in the composite end point of mortality, disabling stroke, and moderate paravalvular leak or with quality of life at 1 year of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Second Arterial Versus Venous Conduits for Multivessel Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in California
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Whether a second arterial conduit improves outcomes after multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting remains unclear. Consequently, arterial conduits other than the left internal thoracic artery are seldom used in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a state-maintained clinical registry including all 126 nonfederal hospitals in California, we compared all-cause mortality and rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and sternal wound infection between propensity score–matched cohorts who underwent primary, isolated multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting with the left internal thoracic artery, and who received a second arterial conduit (right internal thoracic artery or radial artery, n=5866) or a venous conduit (n=53 566) between 2006 and 2011. Propensity score matching using 34 preoperative characteristics yielded 5813 matched sets. A subgroup analysis compared outcomes between propensity score–matched recipients of a right internal thoracic artery (n=1576) or a radial artery (n=4290).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Second arterial conduit use decreased from 10.7% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2011 (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, receipt of a second arterial conduit was associated with significantly lower mortality (13.1% versus 10.6% at 7 years; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.87), and lower risks of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.87) and repeat revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76–0.88). In comparison with radial artery grafts, right internal thoracic artery grafts were associated with similar mortality rates (right internal thoracic artery 10.3% versus radial artery 10.7% at 7 years; hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.89–1.37) and individual risks of cardiovascular events, but the risk of sternal wound infection was increased (risk difference, 1.07%; 95% CI, 0.15–2.07).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Second arterial conduit use in California is low and declining, but arterial grafts were associated with significantly lower mortality and fewer cardiovascular events. A right internal thoracic artery graft offered no benefit over that of a radial artery, but did increase risk of sternal wound infection. These findings suggest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>s should consider lowering their threshold for using arterial grafts, and the radial artery may be the preferred second conduit.</p></sec>

Effect of Obesity and Underweight Status on Perioperative Outcomes of Congenital Heart Operations in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extreme body mass index (BMI; either very high or very low) has been associated with increased risk of adverse perioperative outcome in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. The effect of BMI on perioperative outcomes in congenital heart disease patients has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed studying patients 10 to 35 years of age undergoing a congenital heart disease operation in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. The primary outcomes were operative mortality and a composite outcome (1 or more of operative mortality, major adverse event, prolonged hospital length of stay, and wound infection/dehiscence). The associations between age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles and these outcomes were assessed, with adjustment for patient-level risk factors, with multivariate logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 18 337 patients (118 centers), 16% were obese, 15% were overweight, 53% were normal weight, 7% were underweight, and 9% were severely underweight. Observed risks of operative mortality (<i>P</i>=0.04) and composite outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001) were higher in severely underweight and obese subjects. Severely underweight BMI was associated with increased unplanned cardiac operation and reoperation for bleeding. Obesity was associated with increased risk of wound infection. In multivariable analysis, the association between BMI and operative mortality was no longer significant. Obese (odds ratio, 1.28; <i>P</i>=0.008), severely underweight (odds ratio, 1.29; <i>P</i><0.0001), and underweight (odds ratio, 1.39; <i>P</i>=0.002) subjects were associated with increased risk of composite outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity and underweight BMI were associated with increased risk of composite adverse outcome independently of other risk factors. Further research is necessary to determine whether BMI represents a modifiable risk factor for perioperative outcome.</p></sec>

Predictors and Association With Clinical Outcomes of the Changes in Exercise Capacity After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>At present, there are no objective data specifically examining the clinical impact of variations in exercise capacity post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We describe the changes in exercise capacity between baseline and 6 months post-TAVR, and ascertain factors associated with and clinical implications of a lack of improvement in exercise capacity post-TAVR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 305 patients (mean age, 79±9 years; 44% men; Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk mortality score, 6.7±4.2%) undergoing TAVR completed both baseline and follow-up exercise capacity assessments at 6 months post-TAVR. Exercise capacity was evaluated by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Clinical outcomes were compared between patients displaying greater than (n=152; improving group) versus less than (n=153; nonimproving group) the median percentage change in distance walked between baseline and 6-month follow-up examinations. The primary outcome measure was clinical event rates, measured from the 6-month post-TAVR period onward. Further dichotomization according to baseline 6MWT distance (less than versus more than median walking distance, or slow walker versus fast walker) was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean overall distances walked pre- and post-TAVR (6 months post-TAVR) were 204±119 and 263±116 m, respectively (Δ6MWT=60±106 m), with 219 (72%) patients demonstrating an increase in their walking distance (median percentage increase of the entire population was 20% [interquartile range, 0%–80%]). Factors independently correlated with reduced exercise capacity improvement included a range of baseline clinical characteristics (older age, female sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; <i>P</i><0.05 for all), periprocedural major or life-threatening bleeding (<i>P</i>=0.009) and new-onset anemia at 6 months post-TAVR (<i>P</i>=0.009). Failure to improve the 6MWT distance by at least 20% was independently associated with all-cause mortality (<i>P</i>=0.002) and cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for cardiovascular causes (<i>P</i>=0.001). Baseline slow walkers who were able to improve the 6MWT distance presented with significantly better outcomes than nonimprovers (<i>P</i>=0.01 for all-cause mortality; <i>P</i>=0.001 for cardiovascular end point).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Approximately one-third of patients undergoing TAVR did not improve their exercise capacity postprocedure. The lack of functional improvement post-TAVR was predicted by a mix of baseline and periprocedural factors translating into poorer clinical outcomes. These results suggest that systematically implementing exercise capacity assessment pre- and post-TAVR may help to improve patient risk stratification.</p></sec>

Conscious Sedation Versus General Anesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conscious sedation is used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with limited evidence as to the safety and efficacy of this practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Cardiovascular Data Registry Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry was used to characterize the anesthesia choice and clinical outcomes of all US patients undergoing elective percutaneous transfemoral TAVR between April 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Raw and inverse probability of treatment-weighted analyses were performed to compare patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia with patients undergoing TAVR with conscious sedation on an intention-to-treat basis for the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes including 30-day mortality, in-hospital and 30-day death/stroke, procedural success, intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay, and rates of discharge to home. Post hoc falsification end point analyses were performed to evaluate for residual confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Conscious sedation was used in 1737/10 997 (15.8%) cases with a significant trend of increasing usage over the time period studied (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001). In raw analyses, intraprocedural success with conscious sedation and general anesthesia was similar (98.2% versus 98.5%, <i>P</i>=0.31). The conscious sedation group was less likely to experience in-hospital (1.6% versus 2.5%, <i>P</i>=0.03) and 30-day death (2.9% versus 4.1%, <i>P</i>=0.03). Conversion from conscious sedation to general anesthesia was noted in 102 of 1737 (5.9%) of conscious sedation cases. After inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment for 51 covariates, conscious sedation was associated with lower procedural success (97.9% versus 98.6%, <i>P</i><0.001) and a reduced rate of mortality at the in-hospital (1.5% versus 2.4%, <i>P</i><0.001) and 30-day (2.3% versus 4.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) time points. Conscious sedation was associated with reductions in procedural inotrope requirement, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay (6.0 versus 6.5 days, <i>P</i><0.001), and combined 30-day death/stroke rates (4.8% versus 6.4%, <i>P</i><0.001). Falsification end point analyses of vascular complications, bleeding, and new pacemaker/defibrillator implantation demonstrated no significant differences between groups after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In US practice, conscious sedation is associated with briefer length of stay and lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality in comparison with TAVR with general anesthesia in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. These results suggest the safety of conscious sedation in this population, although comparative effectiveness analyses using observational data cannot definitively establish the superiority of one technique over another.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular and Ventilatory Consequences of Laparoscopic Surgery
<p>Although laparoscopic surgery accounts for >2 million surgical procedures every year, the current preoperative risk scores and guidelines do not adequately assess the risks of laparoscopy. In general, laparoscopic procedures have a lower risk of morbidity and mortality compared with operations requiring a midline laparotomy. During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide insufflation may produce significant hemodynamic and ventilatory consequences such as increased intraabdominal pressure and hypercarbia. Hemodynamic insults secondary to increased intraabdominal pressure include increased afterload and preload and decreased cardiac output, whereas ventilatory consequences include increased airway pressures, hypercarbia, and decreased pulmonary compliance. Hemodynamic effects are accentuated in patients with cardiovascular disease such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease. Prevention of cardiovascular complications may be accomplished through a sound understanding of the hemodynamic and physiological consequences of laparoscopic surgery as well as a defined operative plan generated by a multidisciplinary team involving the preoperative consultant, anesthesiologist, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeon</span></strong>.</p>

Repeat Coronary Revascularization After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on rates and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 years from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 years). After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-year survival rate was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 years after surgery, respectively. The rates of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization rate, whereas advanced age, left main disease, and smoking were associated with a lower rate. There was approximately a 2-fold variation in repeat revascularization rates across centers at 1 year (interquartile range 1.7–3.6%) and 5 years (interquartile range 6.7–12.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Repeat revascularization is performed infrequently among older patients who undergo CABG; however, these rates vary substantially by patient subgroups and among providers.</p></sec>

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-term data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient claims (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods. Among Medicare-linked patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (mean age, 73 years), both reoperation (4.0%) and endocarditis (1.9%) were uncommon to 12 years; however, the risk for other adverse outcomes was high, including death (66.5%), stroke (14.1%), and bleeding (17.9%). Compared with those receiving a mechanical valve, patients given a bioprosthesis had a similar adjusted risk for death (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.07), higher risks for reoperation (hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.14–3.03) and endocarditis (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.94), and lower risks for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.93) and bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.70). Although these results were generally consistent among patient subgroups, bioprosthesis patients aged 65 to 69 years had a substantially elevated 12-year absolute risk of reoperation (10.5%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, long-term mortality rates were similar for those who received bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves. Bioprostheses were associated with a higher long-term risk of reoperation and endocarditis but a lower risk of stroke and hemorrhage. These risks varied as a function of a patient’s age and comorbidities.</p></sec>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s, which have been observed outside its rings. Whether stable radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s exist near the planet and inward of the rings was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmosphere and is decoupled from the rest of the magnetosphere by the planet’s A- to C-rings. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> extends across the D-ring and comprises protons produced through cosmic ray albedo neutron decay and multiple charge-exchange reactions. These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

A Long-Lived Relativistic Electron Storage Ring Embedded in Earth’s Outer Van Allen Belt
<sec><title>Van Allen Variation</title><p>The two rings of relativistic particles called Van Allen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s that encircle Earth were discovered during the space age, and are known to pose risks to satellites in geostationary orbit. NASA launched twin spacecraft, the Van Allen Probes, on 30 August 2012 to measure and characterize Earth's radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> regions. <bold>Baker <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 186, published online 28 February) have shown that a third, unexpected and temporary, radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> formed on 2 September 2012 to disappear 4 weeks later in response to changes in the solar wind.</p></sec>

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon indicate a deficit of small Kuiper belt objects
<p>The flyby of Pluto and Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft provided high-resolution images of cratered surfaces embedded in the Kuiper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>, an extensive region of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters ≲13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (≲1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely ≳4 billion years old, thus their crater records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System.</p>

Jupiter’s magnetosphere and aurorae observed by the Juno spacecraft during its first polar orbits
<p>The Juno spacecraft acquired direct observations of the jovian magnetosphere and auroral emissions from a vantage point above the poles. Juno’s capture orbit spanned the jovian magnetosphere from bow shock to the planet, providing magnetic field, charged particle, and wave phenomena context for Juno’s passage over the poles and traverse of Jupiter’s hazardous inner radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s. Juno’s energetic particle and plasma detectors measured electrons precipitating in the polar regions, exciting intense aurorae, observed simultaneously by the ultraviolet and infrared imaging spectrographs. Juno transited beneath the most intense parts of the radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s, passed about 4000 kilometers above the cloud tops at closest approach, well inside the jovian rings, and recorded the electrical signatures of high-velocity impacts with small particles as it traversed the equator.</p>

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>c chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing risk model, our objective   was to identify risk factors for the development of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 years (one week to 23.1 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died. Overall survival was 76%, 55% and 45% at one, five and   ten years post-operatively, respectively. In a competing risk model   the cumulative risk of the development of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one year, post-operatively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic reconstruction was a significant risk factor for   the development of complications (p = 0.006). Complications were   not significantly related to age or the location or grade of the   tumour (p = 0.823, p = 0.976, p = 0.858). The development of complications   did not have a negative effect on survival (p = 0.147).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study with competing risk analysis of surgery-related   complications in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>c chondrosarcoma. The surgery   in these patients remains prone to complications. Endoprosthetic   reconstruction significantly increases the risk of the development   of complications (p = 0.006). A competing risk model showed that   the development of complications does not have a negative influence   on overall survival (p = 0.147). An aggressive, surgical resection   with the goal of achieving wide margins whenever possible remains   the mainstay of treatment. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:686–96.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s and femur   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the components and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in position and orientation reflect   the migration of the components and the penetration of the femoral   head.

Close-range remote sensing of Saturn’s rings during Cassini’s ring-grazing orbits and Grand Finale
<p>Saturn’s rings are an accessible exemplar of an astrophysical disk, tracing the Saturn system’s dynamical processes and history. We present close-range remote-sensing observations of the main rings from the Cassini spacecraft. We find detailed sculpting of the rings by embedded masses, and banded texture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s throughout the rings. Saturn-orbiting streams of material impact the F ring. There are fine-scaled correlations among optical depth, spectral properties, and temperature in the B ring, but anticorrelations within strong density waves in the A ring. There is no spectral distinction between plateaux and the rest of the C ring, whereas the region outward of the Keeler gap is spectrally distinct from nearby regions. These results likely indicate that radial stratification of particle physical properties, rather than compositional differences, is responsible for producing these ring structures.</p>

Identification of a primordial asteroid family constrains the original planetesimal population
<p>A quarter of known asteroids is associated with more than 100 distinct asteroid families, meaning that these asteroids originate as impact fragments from the family parent bodies. The determination of which asteroids of the remaining population are members of undiscovered families, or accreted as planetesimals from the protoplanetary disk, would constrain a critical phase of planetary formation by unveiling the unknown planetesimal size distribution. We discovered a 4-billion-year-old asteroid family extending across the entire inner part of the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> whose members include most of the dark asteroids previously unlinked to families. This allows us to identify some original planetesimals, which are all larger than 35 kilometers, supporting the view of asteroids being born big. Their number matches the known distinct meteorite parent bodies.</p>

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.</p>

Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt
<p>The synthesis of a carbon nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>, comprising a closed loop of fully fused edge-sharing benzene rings, has been an elusive goal in organic chemistry for more than 60 years. Here we report the synthesis of one such compound through iterative Wittig reactions followed by a nickel-mediated aryl-aryl coupling reaction. The cylindrical shape of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> structure was confirmed by x-ray crystallography, and its fundamental optoelectronic properties were elucidated by ultraviolet-visible absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopic studies, as well as theoretical calculations. This molecule could potentially serve as a seed for the preparation of structurally well-defined carbon nanotubes.</p>

Greater Sensitivity to Drought Accompanies Maize Yield Increase in the U.S. Midwest
<sec><title>Predicting Responses to Drought</title><p>The U.S. Corn Belt accounts for a sizeable portion of the world's maize growth. Various influences have increased yields over the years. <bold>Lobell <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 516; see the Perspective by <bold>Ort and Long</bold>) now show that sensitivity to drought has been increasing as well. It seems that as plants have been bred for increased yield under ideal conditions, the plants become more sensitive to non-ideal conditions. A key factor may be the planting density. Although today's maize varieties are more robust to crowding and the farmer can get more plants in per field, this same crowding takes a toll when water resources are limited.</p></sec>

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of cemented acetabular components as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty. Used   as a local treatment, a higher local dose of bisphosphonate can   be achieved without systemic exposure. We wished to see if this   principle could be applied usefully in total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with   60 participants, we compressed gauze soaked in bisphosphonate solution   (ibandronate) or saline against the acetabular bone bed immediately   before cementing the acetabular component. RSA, classification of   radiolucent lines, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario McMasters   Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were carried out at three-,   six-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the cemented acetabular component relative to the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s was reduced by movement almost half in the ibandronate group,   when measured as maximum total point or as movement of the femoral   head (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Radiolucent lines after   one year were classified as absent, partial or complete, and correlated with   treatment (rho 0.37; p = 0.004). Only three of 30 patients in the   ibandronate group had complete lines, compared with 13 of 28 in   the placebo group (p = 0.002).

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The best time for definitive orthopaedic care is often unclear   in patients with multiple injuries. The objective of this study   was make a prospective assessment of the safety of our early appropriate   care (EAC) strategy and to evaluate the potential benefit of additional   laboratory data to determine readiness for surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A cohort of 335 patients with fractures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s, acetabulum,   femur, or spine were included. Patients underwent definitive fixation   within 36 hours if one of the following three parameters were met:   lactate < 4.0 mmol/L; pH ≥ 7.25; or base excess (BE) ≥ -5.5 mmol/L.   If all three parameters were met, resuscitation was designated full   protocol resuscitation (FPR). If less than all three parameters   were met, it was designated an incomplete protocol resuscitation   (IPR). Complications were assessed by an independent adjudication   committee and included infection; sepsis; PE/DVT; organ failure;   pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 66 patients (19.7%) developed 90 complications. An   historical cohort of 1441 patients had a complication rate of 22.1%.   The complication rate for patients with only one EAC parameter at   the point of protocol was 34.3%, which was higher than other groups   (p = 0.041). Patients who had IPR did not have significantly more   complications (31.8%) than those who had FPR (22.6%; p = 0.078).   Regression analysis showed male gender and injury severity score   to be independent predictors of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights important trends in the IPR and FPR groups,   suggesting that differences in resuscitation parameters may guide   care in certain patients; further study is, however, required. We   advocate the use of the existing protocol, while research is continued   for high-risk subgroups. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:122–7.</p></sec>

The orthopaedic manifestation and outcomes of methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> septicaemia
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this paper was to present the clinical features of   patients with musculoskeletal sources of methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus   aureus</i> (MSSA) septicaemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 137 patients presented with MSSA septicaemia between   2012 and 2015. The primary source of infection was musculoskeletal   in 48 patients (35%). Musculoskeletal infection was considered the   primary source of septicaemia when endocarditis and other obvious   sources were excluded. All patients with an arthroplasty at the time   were evaluated for any prosthetic involvement. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most common site of infection was the spine, which occurred   in 28 patients (58%), and was associated with abscess formation   in 16. Back pain was the presenting symptom in these patients, with   a positive predictive value of 100%. A total of 24 patients had   a total of 42 arthroplasties of the hip or knee <i>in situ</i>.   Prosthetic joint infection occurred in six of these patients (25%).   In five patients, the infection originated outside the musculoskeletal   system. Three patients (6%) with MSSA septicaemia from a musculoskeletal   sources died. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Amongst the musculoskeletal sources of MSSA septicaemia, the   spine was the most commonly involved. We recommend an MRI scan of   the whole spine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s in patients with MSSA septicaemia with   back pain, when the primary source of infection has not been identified   or clinical examination is unreliable.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1545–51.</p></sec>

Three-dimensional morphology and bony range of movement in hip joints in patients with hip dysplasia
<p>To confirm whether developmental dysplasia of   the hip has a risk of hip impingement, we analysed maximum ranges   of movement to the point of bony impingement, and impingement location   using three-dimensional (3D) surface models of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pelvi</span></strong>s and femur   in combination with 3D morphology of the hip joint using computer-assisted methods.   Results of computed tomography were examined for 52 hip joints with   DDH and 73 normal healthy hip joints. DDH shows larger maximum extension   (p = 0.001) and internal rotation at 90° flexion (p < 0.001).   Similar maximum flexion (p = 0.835) and external rotation (p = 0.713)   were observed between groups, while high rates of extra-articular   impingement were noticed in these directions in DDH (p < 0.001).   Smaller cranial acetabular anteversion (p = 0.048), centre-edge   angles (p < 0.001), a circumferentially shallower acetabulum,   larger femoral neck anteversion (p < 0.001), and larger alpha   angle were identified in DDH. Risk of anterior impingement in retroverted   DDH hips is similar to that in retroverted normal hips in excessive   adduction but minimal in less adduction. These findings might be   borne in mind when considering the possibility of extra-articular   posterior impingement in DDH being a source of pain, particularly   for patients with a highly anteverted femoral neck.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:580–9.</p>

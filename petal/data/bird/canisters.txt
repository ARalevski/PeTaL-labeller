Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Early life experience shapes neural genome
<p>The brain is constantly changing in response to environmental experiences throughout life. Mounting evidence from animal and human studies suggests that brain development and behavior are influenced by early life experiences. Several compelling experimental models have been developed to study the effect of early life experiences on the brain, such as stress, exposure to toxins, availability of nutrients, adversity, and quality of maternal care (<i>1</i>). The relationship between genes and environment on the brain and how they affect behavior has been a long-standing issue. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> the genome of individual brain cells be changed by environmental factors? If so, which types of genetic changes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> result? What is the molecular basis of this genetic diversity? What are the physiological implications? On page 1395 of this issue, Bedrosian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) explore one possibility for how neuronal genomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> exhibit plasticity in response to environmental factors during early life, providing integrative evidence for the effect of early maternal care on the genomes of neurons.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems
<p>Chemistries exhibiting complex dynamics—from inorganic oscillators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong>not be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> simpler molecular mechanisms, designed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for complex chemical dynamics and that autonomous molecular systems <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> be designed via molecular programming languages.</p>

A cyclic oligonucleotide signaling pathway in type III CRISPR-Cas systems
<p>Type III CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotes provide immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated degradation of transcriptionally active DNA and its transcripts by the Csm effector complex. The Cas10 subunit of the complex contains an HD nuclease domain that is responsible for DNA degradation and two Palm domains with elusive functions. In addition, Csm6, a ribonuclease that is not part of the complex, is also required to provide full immunity. We show here that target RNA binding by the Csm effector complex of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> triggers Cas10 to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cA<i><sub>n</sub></i>; <i>n</i> = 2 to 6) by means of the Palm domains. Acting as signaling molecules, cyclic oligoadenylates bind Csm6 to activate its nonspecific RNA degradation. This cyclic oligoadenylate–based signaling pathway coordinates different components of CRISPR-Cas to prevent phage infection and propagation.</p>

Using climate models to estimate the quality of global observational data sets
<p>Observational estimates of the climate system are essential to monitoring and understanding ongoing climate change and to assessing the quality of climate models used to produce near- and long-term climate information. This study poses the dual and unconventional question: Can climate models be used to assess the quality of observational references? We show that this question not only rests on solid theoretical grounds but also offers insightful applications in practice. By comparing four observational products of sea surface temperature with a large multimodel climate forecast ensemble, we find compelling evidence that models systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent product. These results call for generalized procedures of model-observation comparison and provide guidance for a more objective observational data set selection.</p>

Neurotransmitter Switching in the Adult Brain Regulates Behavior
<sec><title>Daylight Determines Dopamine</title><p>Expression of the appropriate neurotransmitters is essential for the function of neural circuits. Can neurons change their transmitter phenotype to deal with alterations in the environment? <bold>Dulcis <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 449; see the Perspective by <bold>Birren and Marder</bold>) exposed adult rats to different photoperiods mimicking summer and winter daylengths. Neurotransmitter expression switched between dopamine and somatostatin in hypothalamic neurons that regulate release of corticotropin-releasing factor. Transmitter switching occurred at the transcriptional level and was accompanied by changes in postsynaptic receptors.</p></sec>

NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)-Guided Therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Signifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong>tly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not signifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong>tly improve the combined event rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.37; <i>P</i>=0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus conventional patients, <i>P</i>=0.39). Guided therapy also did not signifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong>tly improve any of the secondary end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The PRIMA II trial (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">can</span></strong> NT-ProBNP-Guided Therapy During Hospital Admission for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Reduce Mortality and Readmissions?) demonstrates that the guidance of HF therapy to reach an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% after clinical stabilization did not improve 6-month outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.trialregister.nl</ext-link>.

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems depend on the Cas1-Cas2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ase to capture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate short foreign DNA fragments into the CRISPR locus, enabling adaptation to new viruses. We present crystal structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation complexes, as well as a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the full CRISPR locus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation complex, including the accessory protein IHF (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation host factor). The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA structure to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.</p>

Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into chloroplasts. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner chloroplast envelope membrane by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the chloroplast envelope. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant chloroplasts and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in chloroplast biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed by the in vitro reconstitution of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation into chloroplast membranes. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely independent of SEC2. FTSH12 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into the envelope membrane in a coupled import-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into the envelope in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ates a subset of inner envelope membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

Inverse-designed metastructures that solve equations
<p>Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the field of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the input function to an equation associated with a prescribed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al equation and using a set of waveguides as the input and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e chip-scale, fast, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>able computing elements.</p>

Renewable acrylonitrile production
<p>Acrylonitrile (ACN) is a petroleum-derived compound used in resins, polymers, acrylics, and carbon fiber. We present a process for renewable ACN production using 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), which can be produced microbially from sugars. The process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>es ACN molar yields exceeding 90% from ethyl 3-hydroxypropanoate (ethyl 3-HP) via dehydration and nitrilation with ammonia over an inexpensive titanium dioxide solid acid catalyst. We further describe an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated process modeled at scale that is based on this chemistry and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>es near-quantitative ACN yields (98 ± 2%) from ethyl acrylate. This endothermic approach eliminates runaway reaction hazards and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>es higher yields than the standard propylene ammoxidation process. Avoidance of hydrogen cyanide as a by-product also improves process safety and mitigates product handling requirements.</p>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ing good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks
<p>Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell signaling pathways somehow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered network (CFN) approach revealed that cell signaling pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell signaling pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell signaling pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive “OR” gates determine a large number of signal transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings reveal that cell signaling pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.</p>

Cell-autonomous clock of astrocytes drives circadian behavior in mammals
<p>Circadian (~24-hour) rhythms depend on intracellular transcription-translation negative feedback loops (TTFLs). How these self-sustained cellular clocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e multicellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation and thereby direct daily rhythms of behavior in animals is largely obscure. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the fulcrum of this pathway from gene to cell to circuit to behavior in mammals. We describe cell type–specific, functionally distinct TTFLs in neurons and astrocytes of the SCN and show that, in the absence of other cellular clocks, the cell-autonomous astrocytic TTFL alone can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and circadian behavior in mice. Astrocytic clocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e this by reinstating clock gene expression and circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic signals. Our results demonstrate that astrocytes can autonomously initiate and sustain complex mammalian behavior.</p>

Genomic signals of selection predict climate-driven population declines in a migratory bird

Infants make more attempts to achieve a goal when they see adults persist
<p>Persistence, above and beyond IQ, is associated with long-term academic outcomes. To look at the effect of adult models on infants’ persistence, we conducted an experiment in which 15-month-olds were assigned to one of three conditions: an Effort condition in which they saw an adult try repeatedly, using various methods, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e each of two different goals; a No Effort condition in which the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed the goals effortlessly; or a Baseline condition.

Pedagogical cues modulated the effect. The results suggest that adult models causally affect infants’ persistence and that infants can generalize the value of persistence to novel tasks.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated optical circuits.</p>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway
<p>The phenolic hormone salicylic acid (SA) induces stomatal closure. It has been suggested that SA signaling is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation mechanism remains unclear. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase Open Stomata1 (OST1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are key for ABA-induced activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 and stomatal closure. Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal closure and SA activation of slow-type anion channel are impaired in the CPK disruption mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disruption mutant <i>ost1-3</i>. We also found that the key phosphorylation sites of SLAC1 in ABA signaling, serine-59 and serine-120, also are important for SA signaling. Chemiluminescence-based detection of superoxide anion revealed that SA did not require CPK3 and CPK6 for the induction of reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our results suggest that SA activates peroxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species signal that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-dependent ABA signaling branch but not the OST1-dependent signaling branch in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) guard cells.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid genome structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in genetics and genomics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the genome structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A genome diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B genome diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB genome tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A genome; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B genome; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB genome. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B genomes. The comparative genomics with genome sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> genome has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated tetraploid consensus maps, and genome-specific diploid maps will increase the genetic and genomic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed.</p>

Prognostic Implications of Magnetic Resonance–Derived Quantification in Asymptomatic Patients With Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for the quantitative assessment of organic mitral regurgitation (OMR). The aim of the present study was to compare the discriminative power of MRI quantification and the recommended Doppler echocardiography (ECHO)–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach to identify asymptomatic patients with OMR and adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 258 asymptomatic patients (63±14 years, 60% men) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%) and chronic moderate and severe OMR (flail 25%, prolapse 75%) defined by using the ECHO-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach. All patients underwent MRI to quantify regurgitant volume (RV) of OMR by subtracting the aortic forward flow volume from the total left ventricular stroke volume. Severe OMR was defined as RV≥60 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean ECHO-derived RV was on average 17.1 mL larger than the MRI-derived RV (<i>P</i><0.05). Concordant grading of OMR severity with both techniques was observed in 197 (76%) individuals with 62 (31%) patients having severe OMR (MRI SEV-ECHO SEV) and 135 (69%) patients having moderate OMR (MRI MOD-ECHO MOD). The remaining 61 (24%) individuals had discordant findings (MRI SEV-ECHO MOD or MRI MOD-ECHO SEV) between the 2 techniques. The majority of these differences in OMR classification were observed in patients with late systolic or multiple jets (both κ<0.2). Patients with eccentric jets showed moderate agreement (κ=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64). In contrast, a very good agreement (κ=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.98) was observed in a combination of holosystolic, central, and single jet. During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5–6.0 years), 38 (15%) patients died and 106 (41%) either died or developed indication for mitral valve surgery. In separate Cox regression analyses, the MRI-derived left ventricular end-systolic volume index, RV, and OMR category (severe versus moderate), and the ECHO-derived OMR category were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (all <i>P</i><0.05). The MRI-derived RV showed the largest area under the curve to predict mortality (0.72) or its combination with the development of indication for mitral valve surgery (0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the MRI-derived assessment of OMR can better identify patients with severe OMR and adverse outcome than ECHO-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach warranting close follow-up and perhaps, early mitral valve surgery.</p></sec>

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CFR was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial scar and ischemia, rate-pressure product, type of radiotracer or stress agent used, and revascularization after scan (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–2.31; <i>P</i><0.001 per unit decrease in CFR after adjustment for maximal MBF and clinical covariates; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84–1.27; <i>P</i>=0.8 per unit decrease in maximal MBF after adjustment for CFR and clinical covariates). In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but preserved maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular mortality of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year. These patients were predominantly women (70%). Patients with preserved CFR but impaired maximal MBF had low cardiovascular mortality of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly preserved CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular mortality of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year. In multivariable analysis, the cardiovascular mortality risk gradient across the 4 concordant or discordant categories was independently driven by impaired CFR irrespective of impairment in maximal MBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CFR is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF. Concordant and discordant categories based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ating CFR and maximal MBF identify unique prognostic phenotypes of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p></sec>

Reductions in Atherogenic Lipids and Major Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A continuous relationship between reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has been observed in statin and ezetimibe outcomes trials down to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed levels of 54 mg/dL. However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C levels <50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 reductions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were pooled from 10 double-blind trials (6699 patient-years of follow-up). Randomization was to alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks or control for 24 to 104 weeks, added to background statin therapy in 8 trials. This analysis included 4974 patients (3182 taking alirocumab, 1174 taking placebo, 618 taking ezetimibe). In a post hoc analysis, the relationship between average on-treatment lipid levels and percent reductions in lipids from baseline were correlated with MACE (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in multivariable analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 33.1% of the pooled cohort <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed average LDL-C <50 mg/dL (44.7%–52.6% allocated to alirocumab, 6.5% allocated to ezetimibe, and 0% allocated to placebo). In total, 104 patients experienced MACE (median time to event, 36 weeks). For every 39 mg/dL lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed LDL-C, the risk of MACE appeared to be 24% lower (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.0025). Percent reductions in LDL-C from baseline were inversely correlated with MACE rates (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–0.89 per additional 50% reduction from baseline; <i>P</i>=0.003).

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ations using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regulating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regulated by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective maintenance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell regulators are altered and down-regulated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regulated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche maintenance in Arabidopsis.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>es complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood genome. Our genome sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest genome for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The genome annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteogenomic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by genomic approaches. Proteogenomic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar genomes alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar genomes. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant genome. The availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance genomics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed via metabolic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ing high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ing high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>e this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>es a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Bone penetration of both antibiotics   was less in TKA than THA, and may relate to the use of a tourniquet.   Using this antibiotic combination, effective cover against the two   common infective organisms was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed in all THAs and all but   one TKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:358–64.</p></sec>

The outcome and complications of vascularised fibular grafts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting has been used for the treatment   of large bony defects for more than 40 years. However, there is   little information about the risk factors for failure and whether   newer locking techniques of fixation improve the rates of union.   The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of union of free   fibular grafts fixed with locking and traditional techniques, and   to quantify the risk factors for nonunion and failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review involved 134 consecutive procedures over   a period of 20 years. Of these, 25 were excluded leaving 109 patients   in the study. There were 66 men and 43 women, with a mean age of   33 years (5 to 78). Most (62) were performed for oncological indications,   and the most common site (52) was the lower limb. Rate of union   was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and risk factors for   nonunion were assessed using Cox regression. All patients were followed   up for at least one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of union was 82% at two years and 97% at five years.   Union was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed after the initial procedure in 76 patients (70%)   at a mean of ten months (3 to 19), and overall union was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed   in 99 patients (91%)<bold>. </bold>No surgical factor, including   the use of locked fixation or supplementary corticocancellous bone   grafts increased the rate of union. A history of smoking was significantly   associated with a risk of nonunion.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting is a successful form of treatment   for large bony defects. These results suggest that the use of modern   techniques of fixation does not affect the risk of nonunion when   compared with traditional forms of fixation, and smoking increases   the risk of nonunion following this procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:134–8.</p></sec>

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Comparison of the outcome of total ankle arthroplasty for osteoarthritis with moderate and severe varus malalignment and that with neutral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic   outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in patients with pre-operatively   moderate and severe arthritic varus ankles to those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed for   patients with neutral ankles.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 105 patients (105 ankles), matched for age, gender,   body mass index, and follow-up duration, were divided into three   groups by pre-operative coronal plane tibiotalar angle; neutral   (< 5°), moderate (5° to 15°) and severe (> 15°) varus deformity.   American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot   score, a visual analogue scale (VAS), and Short Form (SF)-36 score   were used to compare the clinical outcomes after a mean follow-up period   of 51 months (24 to 147).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The post-operative AOFAS, VAS scores, range of movement and complication   rates did not significantly differ among three groups. However,   there was less improvement in the SF-36 score of the severe varus   group (p = 0.008). The mean post-operative tibiotalar alignment   was 2.6° (0.1° to 8.9°), 3.1° (0.1° to 6.5°) and 4.6° (1.0° to 10.6°)   in the neutral, moderate and severe groups respectively. Although   the severe varus group showed less corrected alignment than the   neutral group, the mean tibiotalar angles of the three groups were   within neutral alignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TAA for moderate and severe varus arthritic deformity showed   similar satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes as those   obtained by patients in the neutral group when post-operative neutral   alignment was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">achiev</span></strong>ed.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1335–42.</p></sec>

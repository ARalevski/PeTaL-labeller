Gut microbiome–mediated bile acid metabolism regulates liver cancer via NKT cells
<p>Primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> tumors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> metastasis currently represent the leading cause of cancer-related death. Commensal bacteria are important regulators of antitumor immunity, and although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> is exposed to gut bacteria, their role in antitumor surveillance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> tumors is poorly understood. We found that altering commensal gut bacteria in mice induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>-selective antitumor effect, with an increase of hepatic CXCR6<sup>+</sup> natural killer T (NKT) cells and heightened interferon-γ production upon antigen stimulation. In vivo functional studies showed that NKT cells mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>-selective tumor inhibition. NKT cell accumulation was regulated by CXCL16 expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> sinusoidal endothelial cells, which was controlled by gut microbiome-mediated primary-to-secondary bile acid conversion. Our study suggests a link between gut bacteria–controlled bile acid metabolism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> antitumor immunosurveillance.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, lipid-overloaded hepatocytes and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s of patients with hepatic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains lipid homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

The Hippo pathway effector TAZ induces TEAD-dependent liver inflammation and tumors
<p>The Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size and plays critical roles in maintaining tissue growth, homeostasis, and regeneration. Dysregulated in a wide spectrum of cancers, in mammals, this pathway is regulated by two key effectors, YAP and TAZ, that may functionally overlap. We found that TAZ promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> inflammation and tumor development. The expression of TAZ, but not YAP, in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> tumors positively correlated with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Hyperactivated TAZ induced substantial myeloid cell infiltration into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines through a TEAD-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, tumors with hyperactivated YAP and TAZ had distinct transcriptional signatures, which included the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in TAZ-driven tumors. Our study elucidated a previously uncharacterized link between TAZ activity and inflammatory responses that influence tumor development in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>.</p>

MNADK, a novel liver-enriched mitochondrion-localized NAD kinase
<p>NADP<sup>+</sup> and its reducing equivalent NADPH are essential for counteracting oxidative damage. Mitochondria are the major source of oxidative stress, since the majority of superoxide is generated from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Because NADP<sup>+</sup> cannot pass through the mitochondrial membrane, NADP<sup>+</sup> generation within mitochondria is critical. However, only a single human NAD kinase (NADK) has been identified, and it is localized to the cytosol. Therefore, sources of mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> and mechanisms for maintaining its redox balance remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the uncharacterized human gene C5ORF33, named MNADK (mouse homologue 1110020G09Rik), encodes a novel mitochondrion-localized NAD kinase. In mice <i>MNADK</i> is mostly expressed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>, and also abundant in brown fat, heart, muscle and kidney, all being mitochondrion-rich. Indeed, MNADK is localized to mitochondria in Hep G2 cells, a human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> cell line, as demonstrated by fluorescence imaging. Having a conserved NAD kinase domain, a recombinant MNADK showed NAD kinase activity, confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Consistent with a role of NADP<sup>+</sup> as a coenzyme in anabolic reactions, such as lipid synthesis, <i>MNADK</i> is nutritionally regulated in mice. Fasting increased <i>MNADK</i> levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and fat, and obesity dramatically reduced its level in fat. <i>MNADK</i> expression was suppressed in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> tumors. Identification of MNADK immediately suggests a model in which NADK and MNADK are responsible for <i>de novo</i> synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> in cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, and therefore provides novel insights into understanding the sources and mechanisms of mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADH production in human cells.</p>

Unphosphorylated ISGF3 drives constitutive expression of interferon-stimulated genes to protect against viral infections
<p>Interferon (IFN)–stimulated genes (ISGs) are antiviral effectors that are induced by IFNs through the formation of a tripartite transcription factor ISGF3, which is composed of IRF9 and phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT2. However, we found that IFN-independent ISG expression was detectable in immortalized cell lines, primary intestinal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> organoids, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> tissues. The constitutive expression of ISGs was mediated by the unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) complex, consisting of IRF9 together with unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2. Under homeostatic conditions, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 were found in the nucleus. Analysis of a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set revealed that STAT1 specifically bound to the promoters of ISGs even in the absence of IFNs. Knockdown of STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 by RNA interference led to the decreased expression of various ISGs in Huh7.5 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> cells, which was confirmed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from <i>STAT1</i><sup>−/−</sup>, <i>STAT2</i><sup>−/−</sup>, or <i>IRF9</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Furthermore, decreased ISG expression was accompanied by increased replication of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus. Conversely, simultaneous overexpression of all ISGF3 components, but not any single factor, induced the expression of ISGs and inhibited viral replication; however, no phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 were detected. A phosphorylation-deficient STAT1 mutant was comparable to the wild-type protein in mediating the IFN-independent expression of ISGs and antiviral activity, suggesting that ISGF3 works in a phosphorylation-independent manner. These data suggest that the U-ISGF3 complex is both necessary and sufficient for constitutive ISG expression and antiviral immunity under homeostatic conditions.</p>

MAVS-dependent host species range and pathogenicity of human hepatitis A virus
<p>Hepatotropic viruses are important causes of human disease, but the intrahepatic immune response to hepatitis viruses is poorly understood because of a lack of tractable small- animal models. We describe a murine model of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection that recapitulates critical features of type A hepatitis in humans. We demonstrate that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-mediated type I interferon responses defines its host species range. HAV-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> injury was associated with interferon-independent intrinsic hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatic inflammation that unexpectedly resulted from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling. This murine model thus reveals a previously undefined link between innate immune responses to virus infection and acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> injury, providing a new paradigm for viral pathogenesis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

TRIF-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling suppresses <i>Scd1</i> transcription in hepatocytes and prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> disease (NAFLD) includes a spectrum of diseases that ranges in severity from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis, the latter of which is a major predisposing factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> cirrhosis and cancer. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is critical for innate immunity, is generally believed to aggravate disease progression by inducing inflammation. Unexpectedly, we found that deficiency in TIR domain–containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), a cytosolic adaptor that transduces some TLR signals, worsened hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and that such exacerbation was independent of myeloid cells. The aggravated steatosis in <i>Trif</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice was due to the increased hepatocyte transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl–coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis. Activation of the TRIF pathway by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] suppressed the increase in SCD1 abundance induced by palmitic acid or an HFD and subsequently prevented lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a transcriptional regulator downstream of TRIF, acted as a transcriptional suppressor by directly binding to the <i>Scd1</i> promoter. These results suggest an unconventional metabolic function for TLR/TRIF signaling that should be taken into consideration when seeking to pharmacologically inhibit this pathway.</p>

IRE1α promotes viral infection by conferring resistance to apoptosis
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an ancient cellular pathway that detects and alleviates protein-folding stresses. The UPR components X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) promote type I interferon (IFN) responses. We found that <i>Xbp1</i>-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages had impaired antiviral resistance. However, this was not because of a defect in type I IFN responses but rather an inability of <i>Xbp1</i>-deficient cells to undergo viral-induced apoptosis. The ability to undergo apoptosis limited infection in wild-type cells. <i>Xbp1</i>-deficient cells were generally resistant to the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through an indirect mechanism involving activation of the nuclease IRE1α. We observed an IRE1α-dependent reduction in the abundance of the proapoptotic microRNA miR-125a and a corresponding increase in the amounts of the members of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family. The activation of IRE1α by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein NS4B in XBP1-proficient cells also conferred apoptosis resistance and promoted viral replication. Furthermore, we found evidence of IRE1α activation and decreased miR-125a abundance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> biopsies from patients infected with HCV compared to those in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s of healthy controls. Our results reveal a prosurvival role for IRE1α in virally infected cells and suggest a possible target for IFN-independent antiviral therapy.</p>

Transcriptional activation of lipogenesis by insulin requires phosphorylation of MED17 by CK2
<p>De novo lipogenesis is precisely regulated by nutritional and hormonal conditions. The genes encoding various enzymes involved in this process, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), are transcriptionally activated in response to insulin. We showed that USF1, a key transcription factor for <i>FASN</i> activation, directly interacted with the Mediator subunit MED17 at the <i>FASN</i> promoter. This interaction recruited Mediator, which can bring POL II and other general transcription machinery to the complex. Moreover, we showed that MED17 was phosphorylated at Ser<sup>53</sup> by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s of fed mice or insulin-stimulated hepatocytes, but not in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s of fasted mice or untreated hepatocytes. Furthermore, activation of the <i>FASN</i> promoter in response to insulin required this CK2-mediated phosphorylation event, which occurred only in the absence of p38 MAPK–mediated phosphorylation at Thr<sup>570</sup>. Overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable S53A MED17 mutant or knockdown of MED17, as well as CK2 knockdown or inhibition, impaired hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis and decreased triglyceride content in mice. These results demonstrate that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser<sup>53</sup> in MED17 is required for the transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes in response to insulin.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to develop new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap.

Unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress engenders immune-resistant, latent pancreatic cancer metastases
<p>The majority of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) develop metastatic disease after resection of their primary tumor. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s from patients and mice with PDA harbor single disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) lacking expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI). We created a mouse model to determine how these DCCs develop. Intraportal injection of immunogenic PDA cells into preimmunized mice seeded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s only with single, nonreplicating DCCs that were CK19<sup>–</sup> and MHCI<sup>–</sup>. The DCCs exhibited an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response but paradoxically lacked both inositol-requiring enzyme 1α activation and expression of the spliced form of transcription factor XBP1 (XBP1s). Inducible expression of XBP1s in DCCs, in combination with T cell depletion, stimulated the outgrowth of macrometastatic lesions that expressed CK19 and MHCI. Thus, unresolved ER stress enables DCCs to escape immunity and establish latent metastases.</p>

Translocation of a gut pathobiont drives autoimmunity in mice and humans

We found that translocation of a gut pathobiont, <i>Enterococcus gallinarum</i>, to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and other systemic tissues triggers autoimmune responses in a genetic background predisposing to autoimmunity. Antibiotic treatment prevented mortality in this model, suppressed growth of <i>E. gallinarum</i> in tissues, and eliminated pathogenic autoantibodies and T cells. Hepatocyte–<i>E. gallinarum</i> cocultures induced autoimmune-promoting factors. Pathobiont translocation in monocolonized and autoimmune-prone mice induced autoantibodies and caused mortality, which could be prevented by an intramuscular vaccine targeting the pathobiont. <i>E. gallinarum</i>–specific DNA was recovered from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> biopsies of autoimmune patients, and cocultures with human hepatocytes replicated the murine findings; hence, similar processes apparently occur in susceptible humans. These discoveries show that a gut pathobiont can translocate and promote autoimmunity in genetically predisposed hosts.</p>

Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes
<p>Obesity occurs when whole-body energy intake exceeds energy expenditure for prolonged periods. This is a major public health issue because obesity increases the risk of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and muscle store excess energy in the form of fat, leading to resistance to the hormone insulin. Released when blood glucose rises after meals, insulin normally promotes glucose uptake by muscle and represses glucose production by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>, thus rapidly returning blood glucose to normal. However, this process is impaired in insulin-resistant individuals, who may eventually develop persistently elevated blood glucose (i.e., T2DM), which can cause debilitating or life-threatening complications. Because the energy sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes muscle glucose uptake by insulin-independent mechanisms, it was proposed in 1999 that AMPK-activating drugs might represent a novel approach to treating T2DM (<i>1</i>). Representing the culmination of more than 15 years of developing this concept, a study by Myers <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 507 of this issue and a study by Cokorinos <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that compounds that bind to a unique site on AMPK can promote glucose uptake by muscle, and hence reverse elevated blood glucose in animal models of T2DM.</p>

Cancer bypasses the lymph nodes

But is colon cancer spread to lymph nodes a precursor of spread to another organ (e.g., the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>) or rather an indicator of colon cancer cells' metastatic competence?

Local amplifiers of IL-4Rα–mediated macrophage activation promote repair in lung and liver
<p>The type 2 immune response controls helminth infection and maintains tissue homeostasis but can lead to allergy and fibrosis if not adequately regulated. We have discovered local tissue-specific amplifiers of type 2–mediated macrophage activation. In the lung, surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhanced interleukin-4 (IL-4)–dependent macrophage proliferation and activation, accelerating parasite clearance and reducing pulmonary injury after infection with a lung-migrating helminth. In the peritoneal cavity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>, C1q enhancement of type 2 macrophage activation was required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> repair after bacterial infection, but resulted in fibrosis after peritoneal dialysis. IL-4 drives production of these structurally related defense collagens, SP-A and C1q, and the expression of their receptor, myosin 18A. These findings reveal the existence within different tissues of an amplification system needed for local type 2 responses.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Pharmacological preconditioning with erythropoietin attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction induced in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock
<p>Pre-treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exert tissue-protective effects against ‘ischemia-reperfusion’-type injuries. This protection might be mediated by mobilization of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are thought to secrete paracrine factors. These effects could be exploited to protect against tissue injury induced in cases where hemorrhage is foreseeable, for example, prior to major surgery. Here, we investigate the effects of EPO pre-treatment on the organ injury and dysfunction induced by hemorrhagic shock (HS). Recombinant human EPO (1000 IU/kg/day i.p.) was administered to rats for 3 days. Rats were subjected to HS on day 4 (pre-treatment protocol). Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 35±5 mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by resuscitation with 20 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate for 10 minutes and 50% of the shed blood for 50 minutes. Rats were sacrificed 4 hours after the onset of resuscitation. EPC (CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cell) mobilization was measured following the 3-day pre-treatment with EPO and was significantly increased compared with rats pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline. EPO pre-treatment significantly attenuated organ injury and dysfunction (renal, hepatic and neuromuscular) caused by HS. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s from rats subjected to HS, EPO enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (activation), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; inhibition) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; activation). In the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>, HS also caused an increase in nuclear translocation of p65 (activation of NF-κB), which was attenuated by EPO. This data suggests that repetitive dosing with EPO prior to injury might protect against the organ injury and dysfunction induced by HS, by a mechanism that might involve mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in the activation of the Akt-eNOS survival pathway and inhibition of activation of GSK-3β and NF-κB.</p>

Rev-erbα dynamically modulates chromatin looping to control circadian gene transcription
<p>Mammalian physiology exhibits 24-hour cyclicity due to circadian rhythms of gene expression controlled by transcription factors that constitute molecular clocks. Core clock transcription factors bind to the genome at enhancer sequences to regulate circadian gene expression, but not all binding sites are equally functional. We found that in mice, circadian gene expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> is controlled by rhythmic chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Rev-erbα, a core repressive transcription factor of the clock, opposes functional loop formation between Rev-erbα–regulated enhancers and circadian target gene promoters by recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 co-repressor complex, histone deacetylation, and eviction of the elongation factor BRD4 and the looping factor MED1. Thus, a repressive arm of the molecular clock operates by rhythmically modulating chromatin loops to control circadian gene transcription.</p>

Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral immune mechanisms. Here we show that an HCV-related hepacivirus discovered in Norway rats can establish high-titer hepatotropic infections in laboratory mice with immunological features resembling those seen in human viral hepatitis. Whereas immune-compromised mice developed persistent infection, immune-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> injury. Transient depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before infection resulted in chronic infection, characterized by high levels of intrahepatic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intrahepatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Natural killer cells controlled early infection but were not essential for viral clearance. This model may provide mechanistic insights into hepatic antiviral immunity, a prerequisite for the development of HCV vaccines.</p>

Immunology taught by rats
<p>Immunology may be best taught by viruses (<i>1</i>), and possibly by humans (<i>2</i>), but the rats of New York City surprisingly also have plenty to offer. A survey published in 2014 of the pathogens carried by rats trapped in houses and parks in Manhattan identified a huge burden of infectious agents in these animals, including several novel viruses (<i>3</i>). Among these are Norway rat hepaciviruses (NrHVs), which belong to the same family as hepatitis C virus (HCV). NrHVs were found in rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>s, raising the possibility of establishing a small animal model of human HCV infection. On page 204 of this issue, Billerbeck <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) fulfill this prediction.</p>

How tobacco smoke changes the (epi)genome

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s, it can be deduced that ammonia production through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong> catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for ablation. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the bone during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Ssrp1a controls organogenesis by promoting cell cycle progression and RNA synthesis
<p>Tightly controlled DNA replication and RNA transcription are essential for differentiation and tissue growth in multicellular organisms. Histone chaperones, including the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex, are central for these processes and act by mediating DNA access through nucleosome reorganisation. However, their roles in vertebrate organogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of zebrafish mutants for the gene encoding Structure specific recognition protein 1a (Ssrp1a), which, together with Spt16, forms the FACT heterodimer. Focussing on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong> and eye, we show that zygotic Ssrp1a is essential for proliferation and differentiation during organogenesis. Specifically, gene expression indicative of progressive organ differentiation is disrupted and RNA transcription is globally reduced. Ssrp1a-deficient embryos exhibit DNA synthesis defects and prolonged S phase, uncovering a role distinct from that of Spt16, which promotes G<sub>1</sub> phase progression. Gene deletion/replacement experiments in <i>Drosophila</i> show that Ssrp1b, Ssrp1a and N-terminal Ssrp1a, equivalent to the yeast homologue Pob3, can substitute <i>Drosophila</i> Ssrp function. These data suggest that (1) Ssrp1b does not compensate for Ssrp1a loss in the zebrafish embryo, probably owing to insufficient expression levels, and (2) despite fundamental structural differences, the mechanisms mediating DNA accessibility by FACT are conserved between yeast and metazoans. We propose that the essential functions of Ssrp1a in DNA replication and gene transcription, together with its dynamic spatiotemporal expression, ensure organ-specific differentiation and proportional growth, which are crucial for the forming embryo.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liver</span></strong>. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte metabolism and function.</p></sec>

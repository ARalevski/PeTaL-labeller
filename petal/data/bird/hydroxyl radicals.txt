Aberrant choice behavior in alcoholism
<p>More than 2 bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> people worldwide regularly drink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> is a component cause of more than 200 diseases and causes ∼3.3 mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> deaths per year globally (<i>1</i>). The major disease burden comes from harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dependence. Not everyone who regularly consumes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> becomes dependent: ∼15% become engaged in harmful and compulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> drinking (<i>2</i>). Patients suffering from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dependence no longer have the freedom to choose between alternative rewards because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> drinking dictates what should be done next, namely, shaping activities for the next drink. On page 1321 of this issue, Augier <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that aberrant choice behavior—that is, choosing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> over an alternative reward—is a key driver for the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from controlled to compulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> use. They also provide a mechanistic understanding of this aberrant choice behavior that could lead to new treatment opportunities.</p>

A molecular mechanism for choosing alcohol over an alternative reward
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> addict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> leads to increased choice of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> over healthy rewards. We established an exclusive choice procedure in which ~15% of outbred rats chose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> over a high-value reward. These animals displayed addict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-like traits, including high motivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to obtain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> and pursuit of this drug despite adverse consequences. Express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT-3 was selectively decreased within the amygdala of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>-choosing rats, whereas a knockdown of this transcript reversed choice preference of rats that originally chose a sweet solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>. GAT-3 express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was selectively decreased in the central amygdala of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>-dependent people compared to those who died of unrelated causes. Impaired GABA clearance within the amygdala contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> addict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, appears to translate between species, and may offer targets for new pharmacotherapies for treating this disorder.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA).

Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with wear.

Chloride Sensing by WNK1 Involves Inhibition of Autophosphorylation
<sec><title>Inhibited by Chloride in the Active Site</title><p>Chloride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are essential for regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis.

Synthetic glycolate metabolism pathways stimulate crop growth and productivity in the field
<p>Photorespirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is required in C<sub>3</sub> plants to metabolize toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate formed when ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase oxygenates rather than carboxylates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Depending on growing temperatures, photorespirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can reduce yields by 20 to 50% in C<sub>3</sub> crops. Inspired by earlier work, we installed into tobacco chloroplasts synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate metabolic pathways that are thought to be more efficient than the native pathway. Flux through the synthetic pathways was maximized by inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate export from the chloroplast. The synthetic pathways tested improved photosynthetic quantum yield by 20%. Numerous homozygous transgenic lines increased biomass productivity by >40% in replicated field trials. These results show that engineering alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate metabolic pathways into crop chloroplasts while inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate export into the native pathway can drive increases in C<sub>3</sub> crop yield under agricultural field condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

The Acyl Desaturase CER17 Is Involved in Producing Wax Unsaturated Primary Alcohols and Cutin Monomers
<p>We report <i>n</i>-6 monounsaturated primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s (C<sub>26:1</sub>, C<sub>28:1</sub>, and C<sub>30:1</sub> homologs) in the cuticular waxes of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem, a class of wax not previously reported in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis <i>cer17</i> mutant was completely deficient in these monounsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s, and <i>CER17</i> was found to encode a predicted ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE LIKE4 (ADS4). Studies of the Arabidopsis <i>cer4</i> mutant and yeast variously expressing <i>CER4</i> (a predicted fatty acyl-CoA reductase) with <i>CER17/ADS4</i>, demonstrated <i>CER4</i>’s principal role in synthesis of these monounsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s. Besides unsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> deficiency, <i>cer17</i> mutants exhibited a thickened and irregular cuticle ultrastructure and increased amounts of cutin monomers. Although unsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s were absent throughout the <i>cer17</i> stem, the mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>’s effects on cutin monomers and cuticle ultrastructure were much more severe in distal than basal stems, consistent with observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that the <i>CER17/ADS4</i> transcript was much more abundant in distal than basal stems. Furthermore, distal but not basal stems of a double mutant deficient for both CER17/ADS4 and LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 produced even more cutin monomers and a thicker and more disorganized cuticle ultrastructure and higher cuticle permeability than observed for wild type or either mutant parent, indicating a dramatic genetic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of very long chain acyl-CoA precursors. These results provide evidence that CER17/ADS4 performs <i>n</i>-6 desaturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of very long chain acyl-CoAs in both distal and basal stems and has a major funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> associated with governing cutin monomer amounts primarily in the distal segments of the inflorescence stem.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and a comparison with atmospheric observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s show that nearly all nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to sulfuric acid. A considerable fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, but the relatively weak dependence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicates that for the processes studied, variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s, and esters, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of C6-aldehydes into C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s is a key step in the control of GLV composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> levels in the mutant.

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Reconstituted Human TPC1 Is a Proton-Permeable Ion Channel and Is Activated by NAADP or Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sec><title>Showing a Preference for Protons</title><p>Protons (H<sup>+</sup>) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) produce a variety of different effects in cells.

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle accelerat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>less plasmas. Such wave-particle interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of energy transfer in interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s associated with electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cyclotron waves. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are not symmetric around the magnetic field direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> phase relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s provide direct quantitative evidence for collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>less energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s via wave-particle interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, which cause them to become excited upon illuminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, focused on small reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to optically control neuronal dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that carbon radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-carbon sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> metal is not required, and two carbon-carbon bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

The [4Fe4S] cluster of human DNA primase functions as a redox switch using DNA charge transport
<p>DNA charge transport chemistry offers a means of long-range, rapid redox signaling. We demonstrate that the [4Fe4S] cluster in human DNA primase can make use of this chemistry to coordinate the first steps of DNA synthesis. Using DNA electrochemistry, we found that a change in oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> state of the [4Fe4S] cluster acts as a switch for DNA binding. Single-atom mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that inhibit this charge transfer hinder primase initiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> without affecting primase structure or polymerizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Generating a single base mismatch in the growing primer duplex, which attenuates DNA charge transport, inhibits primer truncat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Thus, redox signaling by [4Fe4S] clusters using DNA charge transport regulates primase binding to DNA and illustrates chemistry that may efficiently drive substrate handoff between polymerases during DNA replicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic electron transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower electron transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, indicating a shift of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, electron donat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished electron transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>ate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

The Enzyme Activity and Substrate Specificity of Two Major Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), SbCAD2 and SbCAD4
<p>Cinnamyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the final step in monolignol biosynthesis, reducing sinapaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde to their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong>s in an NADPH-dependent manner. Because of its terminal locat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in monolignol biosynthesis, the variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in substrate specificity and activity of CAD can result in significant changes in overall composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and amount of lignin. Our in-depth characterizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two major CAD isoforms, SbCAD2 (Brown midrib 6 [bmr6]) and SbCAD4, in lignifying tissues of sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for generating renewable chemicals and fuels, indicates their similarity in both structure and activity to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CAD5 and <i>Populus tremuloides</i> sinapyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alcohol</span></strong> dehydrogenase, respectively. This first crystal structure of a monocot CAD combined with enzyme kinetic data and a catalytic model supported by site-directed mutagenesis allows full comparison with dicot CADs and elucidates the potential signature sequence for their substrate specificity and activity. The L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 double mutant displayed its substrate preference in the order coniferaldehyde > <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde > sinapaldehyde, with higher catalytic efficiency than that of both wild-type SbCAD4 and SbCAD2. As SbCAD4 is the only major CAD isoform in <i>bmr6</i> mutants, replacing SbCAD4 with L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 in <i>bmr6</i> plants could produce a phenotype that is more amenable to biomass processing.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Using cold, isotopically labeled cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, we report the spectral signatures of a single, intact water (H<sub>2</sub>O) molecule embedded at various sites in the clathrate-like cage structure adopted by the Cs<sup>+</sup>·(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>20</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. These patterns reveal the site-dependent correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between the frequencies of the two OH groups on the same water molecule and establish that the bound OH compan<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the free OH group exclusively accounts for bands in the lower-energy reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the spectrum. The observed multiplet structures reveal the homogeneous linewidths of the fundamentals and quantify the anharmonic contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s arising from coupling to both the intramolecular bending and intermolecular soft modes.</p>

Complete steric exclusion of ions and proton transport through confined monolayer water
<p>It has long been an aspirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al goal to create artificial structures that allow fast permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of water but reject even the smallest hydrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, replicating the feat achieved by nature in protein channels (e.g., aquaporins). Despite recent progress in creating nanoscale pores and capillaries, these structures still remain distinctly larger than protein channels. We report capillaries made by effectively extracting one atomic plane from bulk crystals, which leaves a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al slit of a few angstroms in height. Water moves through these capillaries with little resistance, whereas no permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> could be detected even for such small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>. Only protons (H<sup>+</sup>) can diffuse through monolayer water inside the capillaries.

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p>Laser cooling of a neutral plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a neutral plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of neutral plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, opening avenues for neutral-plasma confinement and manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is achieved through synchronous contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> release from intracellular stores and subsequent activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as a transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Structural insight into precursor tRNA processing by yeast ribonuclease P
<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a universal ribozyme responsible for processing the 5′-leader of pre–transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. The protein components form a hook-shaped architecture that wraps around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-shaped pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and phosphate backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile phosphate and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis suggests a two-metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> S<sub>N</sub>2 react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage.

Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling
<p>Animals require rapid, long-range molecular signaling networks to integrate sensing and response throughout their bodies. The amino acid glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, facilitating long-range informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exchange via activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of glutamate receptor channels. Similarly, plants sense local signals, such as herbivore attack, and transmit this informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the plant body to rapidly activate defense responses in undamaged parts. Here we show that glutamate is a wound signal in plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels of the <i>GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR–LIKE</i> family act as sensors that convert this signal into an increase in intracellular calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that propagates to distant organs, where defense responses are then induced.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems
<p>Chemistries exhibiting complex dynamics—from inorganic oscillators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either cannot be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma.

Abstract chemical react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics, along with their systematic implementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process.

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “open” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from an open to a closed conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters

In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles.

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high molecular weight polyethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong>. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong> on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. In parallel, gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and cell death.

Serpin-protease interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress

In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> under control and water deficit condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycol</span></strong> treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> might suggest a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of these genes during the early developmental manifestat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of heterosis under fluctuating environmental condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Anti-diuretic activity of a CAPA neuropeptide can compromise <i>Drosophila</i> chill tolerance
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Many insects lose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> balance in the cold. CAPA neuropeptide can slow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport and reduce the cold tolerance of a fly.</p>

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of melanin increases skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. Melanin production depends on the pH of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the pH of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, which is more active at basic pH. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on pH and melanin production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor. Last, we identified sAC inhibitors as a new class of drugs that increase melanosome pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation in vivo, suggesting that pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway may affect skin cancer risk or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation conditions.</p>

Phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments activate mTORC1 in the retinal pigment epithelium
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> epithelium (RPE) transports nutrients and metabolites between the microvascular bed that maintains the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> neurons. The RPE removes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> outer segments (POS) by receptor-mediated phagocytosis, a process that peaks in the morning. Uptake and degradation of POS initiates signaling cascades in the RPE. Upstream stimuli from various metabolic activities converge on mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and aberrant mTORC1 signaling is implicated in aging and age-related degeneration of the RPE. We measured mTORC1-mediated responses to RPE phagocytosis in vivo and in vitro. During the morning burst of POS shedding, there was transient activation of mTORC1-mediated signaling in the RPE. POS activated mTORC1 through lysosome-independent mechanisms, and engulfed POS served as a docking platform for mTORC1 assembly. The identification of POS as endogenous stimuli of mTORC1 in the RPE provides a mechanistic link underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>-RPE interaction in the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>.</p>

Loci associated with skin pigmentation identified in African populations
<p>Despite the wide range of skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation in humans, little is known about its genetic basis in global populations. Examining ethnically diverse African genomes, we identify variants in or near <i>SLC24A5</i>, <i>MFSD12</i>, <i>DDB1</i>, <i>TMEM138</i>, <i>OCA2</i>, and <i>HERC2</i> that are significantly associated with skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation. Genetic evidence indicates that the light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation variant at <i>SLC24A5</i> was introduced into East Africa by gene flow from non-Africans. At all other loci, variants associated with dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation in Africans are identical by descent in South Asian and Australo-Melanesian populations. Functional analyses indicate that <i>MFSD12</i> encodes a lysosomal protein that affects melanogenesis in zebrafish and mice, and that mutations in melanocyte-specific regulatory regions near <i>DDB1/TMEM138</i> correlate with expression of ultraviolet response genes under selection in Eurasians.</p>

Pivotal Roles of Cryptochromes 1a and 2 in Tomato Development and Physiology
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-containing blue/UVA light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s that regulate various plant light-induced physiological processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cryptochromes mediate de-etiolation, photoperiodic control of flowering, entrainment of the circadian clock, cotyledon opening and expansion, anthocyanin accumulation, and root growth. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), cryptochromes are encoded by a multigene family, comprising <i>CRY1a</i>, <i>CRY1b</i>, <i>CRY2</i>, and <i>CRY3</i>. We have previously reported the phenotypes of tomato <i>cry1a</i> mutants and <i>CRY2</i> overexpressing plants. Here, we report the isolation by targeting induced local lesions in genomes, of a tomato <i>cry2</i> knock-out mutant, its introgression in the indeterminate Moneymaker background, and the phenotypes of <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> single and double mutants. The <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> mutant showed phenotypes similar to its Arabidopsis counterpart (long hypocotyls in white and blue light), but also several additional features such as increased seed weight and internode length, enhanced hypocotyl length in red light, inhibited primary root growth under different light conditions, anticipation of flowering under long-day conditions, and alteration of the phase of circadian leaf movements. Both cry1a and cry2 control the levels of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s in leaves, but cry2 has a predominant role in fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation. Metabolites of the sterol, tocopherol, quinone, and sugar classes are differentially accumulated in <i>cry1a</i> and <i>cry2</i> leaves and fruits. These results demonstrate a pivotal role of cryptochromes in controlling tomato development and physiology. The manipulation of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s represents a powerful tool to influence important agronomic traits such as flowering time and fruit quality.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s, which narrow the spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

Thyroid hormone signaling specifies cone subtypes in human retinal organoids
<p>The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) cones of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l organoids. Organoids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>s have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.</p>

Photochemistry beyond the red limit in chlorophyll f–containing photosystems
<p>Photosystems I and II convert solar energy into the chemical energy that powers life. Chlorophyll a photochemistry, using red light (680 to 700 nm), is near universal and is considered to define the energy “red limit” of oxygenic photosynthesis. We present biophysical studies on the photosystems from a cyanobacterium grown in far-red light (750 nm). The few long-wavelength chlorophylls present are well resolved from each other and from the majority <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>, chlorophyll a. Charge separation in photosystem I and II uses chlorophyll f at 745 nm and chlorophyll f (or d) at 727 nm, respectively. Each photosystem has a few even longer-wavelength chlorophylls f that collect light and pass excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s.

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Neuronal birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the neurons that constitute neural circuits. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual systems. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina neurons, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s and lamina cells requires a signaling relay through glia. In response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina neuronal differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating neuronal development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina neuron differentiation.</p>

Laminins containing the β2 and γ3 chains regulate astrocyte migration and angiogenesis in the retina
<p>Pathologies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l blood vessels are among the major causes of blindness worldwide. A key cell type that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l vascular development is the astrocyte. Generated extrinsically to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>, astrocytes migrate into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> through the optic nerve head. Even though there is a strong correlation between astrocyte distribution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l vascular development, the factors that guide astrocytes into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> remain unclear. In this study, we show that astrocytes migrate within a laminin-containing basement membrane - the inner limiting membrane. Genetic deletion of the laminin β2 and γ3 chains affects astrocyte migration and spatial distribution. We show that laminins act as haptotactic factors <i>in vitro</i> in an isoform-specific manner, inducing astrocyte migration and promoting astrocyte differentiation. The addition of exogenous laminins to laminin-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l explants rescues astrocyte migration and spatial patterning. Furthermore, we show that the loss of laminins reduces β1 integrin expression in astrocytes. Culturing laminin-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l astrocytes on laminin substrates restores focal localization of β1 integrin. Finally, we show that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains regulate subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l blood vessel growth and maintain vascular integrity. These <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate clearly that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains are indispensable for migration and spatial organization of astrocytes and that they play a crucial role during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l angiogenesis <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

Inflammation, necrosis, and the kinase RIP3 are key mediators of AAG-dependent alkylation-induced retinal degeneration
<p>DNA-alkylating agents are commonly used to kill cancer cells, but the base excision repair (BER) pathway they trigger can also produce toxic intermediates that cause tissue damage, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l degeneration (RD). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, is assumed to be the main mechanism of this alkylation-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> (PR) cell death in RD. Here, we studied the involvement of necroptosis (another programmed cell death process) and inflammation in alkylation-induced RD. Male mice exposed to a methylating agent exhibited a reduced number of PR cell rows, active gliosis, and cytokine induction and macrophage infiltration in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>. Dying PRs exhibited a necrotic morphology, increased 8-hydroxyguanosine abundance (an oxidative damage marker), and overexpression of the necroptosis-associated genes <i>Rip1</i> and <i>Rip3</i>. The activity of PARP1, which mediates BER, cell death, and inflammation, was increased in PR cells and associated with the release of proinflammatory chemokine HMGB1 from PR nuclei. Mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exhibited more severe RD, whereas deficiency of RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) conferred partial protection. Female mice were partially protected from alkylation-induced RD, showing reduced necroptosis and inflammation compared to males. PRs in mice lacking the BER-initiating DNA glycosylase AAG did not exhibit alkylation-induced necroptosis or inflammation. Our findings show that AAG-initiated BER at alkylated DNA bases induces sex-dependent RD primarily by triggering necroptosis and activating an inflammatory response that amplifies the original damage and, furthermore, reveal new potential targets to prevent this side effect of chemotherapy.</p>

Linking a mutation to survival in wild mice

Next, we show how a mutation in <i>Agouti</i> associated with survival causes lighter coat color through changes in its protein binding properties. Together, our findings demonstrate how a sequence variant alters phenotype and then reveal the ensuing ecological consequences that drive changes in population allele frequency, thereby illuminating the process of evolution by natural selection.</p>

In these structures, phenols are presented in a (supra-)molecular context dictated by the positions of the amino acids in the peptide sequence. Oxidative polymerization can be tuned in a sequence-dependent manner, resulting in peptide sequence–encoded properties such as UV absorbance, morphology, coloration, and electrochemical properties over a considerable range. Short peptides have low barriers to application and can be easily scaled, suggesting near-term applications in cosmetics and biomedicine.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)

Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosensit</span></strong>ization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind.

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient temperature regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the phytochrome B (phyB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> participates in temperature perception through its temperature-dependent reversion from the active Pfr state to the inactive Pr state. Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> functions, phyB is a temperature sensor in plants.</p>

Perception of Sunflecks by the UV-B Photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8

The UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a recent addition to the list of plant photosensory receptors, and we have made considerable advances in our understanding of the physiology and molecular mechanisms of action of UVR8 and its signaling pathway. However, the function of UVR8 in the natural environment is poorly understood. Here, we show that the UVR8 dimer/monomer ratio responds quantitatively and reversibly to the intensity of sunflecks that interrupt shade in the field. Sunflecks reduced hypocotyl growth and increased <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i> (<i>CHS</i>) and <i>ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5</i> gene expression and CHS protein abundance in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings, but the <i>uvr8</i> mutant was impaired in these responses. UVR8 was also required for normal nuclear dynamics of CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1. We propose that UVR8 plays an important role in the plant perception of and response to sunflecks.</p>

Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Extramacrochaetae imposes order on the <i>Drosophila</i> eye by refining the activity of the Hedgehog signaling gradient
<p>The compound eye of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is configured by a differentiating wave, the morphogenetic furrow, that sweeps across the eye imaginal disc and transforms thousands of undifferentiated cells into a precisely ordered repetitive array of 800 ommatidia. The initiation of the furrow at the posterior margin of the epithelium and its subsequent movement across the eye field is controlled by the activity of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Differentiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s that lie behind the furrow produce and secrete the Hh morphogen, which is captured by cells within the furrow itself. This leads to the stabilization of the full-length form of the zinc-finger transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci<sup>155</sup>), the main effector of Hh signaling. Ci<sup>155</sup> functions as a transcriptional activator of a number of downstream targets, including <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>), a TGFβ homolog. In this report, we describe a mechanism that is in place within the fly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> to limit Hh pathway activity within and ahead of the furrow. We demonstrate that the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein Extramacrochaetae (Emc) regulates Ci<sup>155</sup> levels. Loss of <i>emc</i> leads to an increase in Ci<sup>155</sup> levels, nuclear migration, apical cell constriction and an acceleration of the furrow. We find that these roles are distinct from the bHLH protein Hairy (H), which we show restricts <i>atonal</i> (<i>ato</i>) expression ahead of the furrow. Secondary furrow initiation along the dorsal and ventral margins is blocked by the activity of the Wingless (Wg) pathway. We also show that Emc regulates and cooperates with Wg signaling to inhibit lateral furrow initiation.</p>

<i>chaoptin</i>, <i>prominin</i>, <i>eyes shut</i> and <i>crumbs</i> form a genetic network controlling the apical compartment of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells
<p>The apical surface of epithelial cells is often highly specialised to fulfil cell type-specific functions. Many epithelial cells expand their apical surface by forming microvilli, actin-based, finger-like membrane protrusions. The apical surface of <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> cells (PRCs) forms tightly packed microvilli, which are organised into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosensit</span></strong>ive rhabdomeres. As previously shown, the GPI-anchored adhesion protein Chaoptin is required for the stability of the microvilli, whereas the transmembrane protein Crumbs is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis. Here we show that <i>chaoptin</i> synergises with <i>crumbs</i> to ensure optimal rhabdomere width. In addition, reduction of <i>crumbs</i> ameliorates morphogenetic defects observed in PRCs mutant for <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i>, known antagonists of <i>chaoptin</i>. These results suggest that these four genes provide a balance of adhesion and anti-adhesion to maintain microvilli development and maintenance. Similar to <i>crumbs</i> mutant PRCs, PRCs devoid of <i>prominin</i> or <i>eyes shut</i> undergo light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l degeneration. Given the observation that human orthologues of <i>crumbs</i>, <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i> result in progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l degeneration and blindness, the <i>Drosophila</i> eye is ideally suited to unravel the genetic and cellular mechanisms that ensure morphogenesis of PRCs and their maintenance under light-mediated stress.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Mechanisms of <i>prickle1a</i> function in zebrafish epilepsy and retinal neurogenesis
<p>Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures. The etiology is heterogeneous with both genetic and environmental causes. Genes that regulate neurotransmitters and ion channels in the central nervous system have been associated with epilepsy. However, a recent screening in human epilepsy patients identified mutations in the <i>PRICKLE1</i> (<i>PK1</i>) locus, highlighting a potentially novel mechanism underlying seizures. PK1 is a core component of the planar cell polarity network that regulates tissue polarity. Zebrafish studies have shown that Pk1 coordinates cell movement, neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth during embryonic development. Yet how dysfunction of Pk1 relates to epilepsy is unknown. To address the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis, we used zebrafish to characterize Pk1a function and epilepsy-related mutant forms. We show that knockdown of <i>pk1a</i> activity sensitizes zebrafish larva to a convulsant drug. To model defects in the central nervous system, we used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> and found that <i>pk1a</i> knockdown induces neurite outgrowth defects; yet visual function is maintained. Furthermore, we characterized the functional and biochemical properties of the PK1 mutant forms identified in human patients. Functional analyses demonstrate that the wild-type Pk1a partially suppresses the gene knockdown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l defects but not the mutant forms. Biochemical analysis reveals increased ubiquitylation of one mutant form and decreased translational efficiency of another mutant form compared with the wild-type Pk1a. Taken together, our results indicate that mutation of human PK1 could lead to defects in neurodevelopment and signal processing, providing insight into seizure predisposition in these patients.</p>

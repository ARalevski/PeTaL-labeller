Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s to transport resources and information. Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s must trade-off <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> efficiency with the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> failure. Yet, biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in dynamic environments.</p>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>ed systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, enhancing our ability to control them.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s together resulted in improved performance compared to single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Structure, spatial dynamics, and stability of novel seed dispersal mutualistic networks in Hawai<bold></bold>i
<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape communities and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species interactions. To investigate how such changes affect communities, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s on Oahu, Hawaii. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across communities. Furthermore, the structure and stability of the novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s were similar to native-dominated communities worldwide. Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and environment. Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, making restoration of native ecosystems more challenging than previously thought.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to generate coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes. Together, the work reported here illustrates ways to generate robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s optimized for the mining of large transcriptome data sets, thereby providing a useful resource for hypothesis generation and experimental design in strawberry and related Rosaceae fruit crops.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

Structural topology defines protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes in the HIV proteome
<p>Mutationally constrained epitopes of variable pathogens represent promising targets for vaccine design but are not reliably identified by sequence conservation. In this study, we employed structure-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> analysis, which applies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> theory to HIV protein structure data to quantitate the topological importance of individual amino acid residues. Mutation of residues at important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> positions disproportionately impaired viral replication and occurred with high frequency in epitopes presented by protective human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) class I alleles. Moreover, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell targeting of highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>ed epitopes distinguished individuals who naturally control HIV, even in the absence of protective <i>HLA</i> alleles.

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect
<p>Animal social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease transmission. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, transmission quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key transmission-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. This suggests that social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

Quantifying reputation and success in art

Centrality within this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions

Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions.

Entanglement distillation between solid-state quantum network nodes

Integrating network reconstruction with mechanistic modeling to predict cancer therapies
<p>Signal transduction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are often rewired in cancer cells. Identifying these alterations will enable more effective cancer treatment. We developed a computational framework that can identify, reconstruct, and mechanistically model these rewired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s from noisy and incomplete perturbation response data and then predict potential targets for intervention. As a proof of principle, we analyzed a perturbation data set targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) pathways in a panel of colorectal cancer cells. Our computational approach predicted cell line–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> rewiring. In particular, feedback inhibition of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) by the kinase p70S6K was predicted to confer resistance to EGFR inhibition, suggesting that disrupting this feedback may restore sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. We experimentally validated this prediction with colorectal cancer cell lines in culture and in a zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) xenograft model.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p>Blood coagulation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis). Coagulation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) generated by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted coagulation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced coagulation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets generated 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating blood cells generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood coagulation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function.

We present a general strategy to design pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.</p>

The strength of long-range ties in population-scale social networks
<p>Long-range connections that span large social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are widely assumed to be weak, composed of sporadic and emotionally distant relationships. However, researchers historically have lacked the population-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> data needed to verify the predicted weakness. Using data from 11 culturally diverse population-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s on four continents—encompassing 56 million Twitter users and 58 million mobile phone subscribers—we find that long-range ties are nearly as strong as social ties embedded within a small circle of friends.

Small vulnerable sets determine large network cascades in power grids
<p>The understanding of cascading failures in complex systems has been hindered by the lack of realistic large-scale modeling and analysis that can account for variable system conditions. Using the North American power grid, we identified, quantified, and analyzed the set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> components that are vulnerable to cascading failures under any out of multiple conditions. We show that the vulnerable set consists of a small but topologically central portion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> and that large cascades are disproportionately more likely to be triggered by initial failures close to this set. These results elucidate aspects of the origins and causes of cascading failures relevant for grid design and operation and demonstrate vulnerability analysis methods that are applicable to a wider class of cascade-prone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s.</p>

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility; for example, strengthening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased toughness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. The iron-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face recognition: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face recognition fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the core face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> into a familiar face-recognition system.</p>

Stellate cells drive maturation of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit

We found that entorhinal stellate cells provide an activity-dependent instructive signal that drives maturation sequentially and unidirectionally through the intrinsic circuits of the entorhinal-hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. The findings raise the possibility that a small number of autonomously developing neuronal populations operate as intrinsic drivers of maturation across widespread regions of the cortex.</p>

A transcription factor hierarchy defines an environmental stress response network

Yet systematic studies of stress-responsive transcription factor (TF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in multicellular organisms have been limited. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) influences the expression of thousands of genes, allowing us to characterize complex stress-responsive regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identified genome-wide targets of 21 ABA-related TFs to construct a comprehensive regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Determinants of dynamic TF binding and a hierarchy among TFs were defined, illuminating the relationship between differential gene expression patterns and ABA pathway feedback regulation. By extrapolating regulatory characteristics of observed canonical ABA pathway components, we identified a new family of transcriptional regulators modulating ABA and salt responsiveness and demonstrated their utility to modulate plant resilience to osmotic stress.</p>

<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and physiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. Phenotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal pH in the Golgi, trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal pH homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive phenotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar pH close to wild-type values. Together, these data signify that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are endosomal K<sup>+</sup> transporters functioning in maintaining pH and ion homeostasis in the endomembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>.</p>

The G-Box Transcriptional Regulatory Code in Arabidopsis
<p>Plants have significantly more transcription factor (TF) families than animals and fungi, and plant TF families tend to contain more genes; these expansions are linked to adaptation to environmental stressors. Many TF family members bind to similar or identical sequence motifs, such as G-boxes (CACGTG), so it is difficult to predict regulatory relationships. We determined that the flanking sequences near G-boxes help determine in vitro specificity but that this is insufficient to predict the transcription pattern of genes near G-boxes. Therefore, we constructed a gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that identifies the set of bZIPs and bHLHs that are most predictive of the expression of genes downstream of perfect G-boxes. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> accurately predicts transcriptional patterns and reconstructs known regulatory sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s.

Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p>Thicker leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf thickness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the desert tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with thick leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the thick IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf thickness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s that pattern leaf thickness. We show that thick ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> data suggest that leaf thickness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including thick leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf thickness in desert-adapted tomato.</p>

Sequential Duplications of an Ancient Member of the DnaJ-Family Expanded the Functional Chaperone Network in the Eukaryotic Cytosol
<p>Across eukaryotes, Hsp70-based chaperone machineries display an underlying unity in their sequence, structure, and biochemical mechanism of action, while working in a myriad of cellular processes. In good part, this extraordinary functional versatility is derived from the ability of a single Hsp70 to interact with an array of J-protein cochaperones to form a functional chaperone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. Among J-proteins, the DnaJ-type is the most prevalent, being present in all three kingdoms and in several different compartments of eukaryotic cells. However, because these ancient DnaJ-type proteins diverged at the base of the eukaryotic phylogeny, little is understood about the evolutionary basis of their diversification and thus the functional expansion of the chaperone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. Here, we report results of evolutionary and experimental analyses of two more recent members of the cytosolic DnaJ family of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Xdj1 and Apj1, which emerged by sequential duplications of the ancient <i>YDJ1</i> in Ascomycota. Sequence comparison and molecular modeling revealed that both Xdj1 and Apj1 maintained a domain organization similar to that of multifunctional Ydj1. However, despite these similarities, both Xdj1 and Apj1 evolved highly specialized functions. Xdj1 plays a unique role in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria. Apj1’s specialized role is related to degradation of sumolyated proteins. Together these data provide the first clear example of cochaperone duplicates that evolved specialized functions, allowing expansion of the chaperone functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, while maintaining the overall structural organization of their parental gene.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Effects of network modularity on the spread of perturbation impact in experimental metapopulations
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with a modular structure are expected to have a lower risk of global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test the effect of modularity on the response to perturbation. We perturbed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this perturbation, both within and between modules. Our results show the buffering capacity of modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.</p>

A dedicated network for social interaction processing in the primate brain

Exclusivity of specialization was found for no other function anywhere in the brain.

Single-cell transcriptomics and mutagenesis analysis delineated dynamic molecular states of ENS progenitors and identified RET as a regulator of neurogenic commitment.

Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory

After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time.

Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.</p>

ANAC017 Coordinates Organellar Functions and Stress Responses by Reprogramming Retrograde Signaling
<p>Mitochondria adjust their activities in response to external and internal stimuli to optimize growth via the mitochondrial retrograde response signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NAC domain transcription factor ANAC017 has previously been identified as a regulator of the mitochondrial retrograde response. We show here that overexpression of <i>ANAC017</i> in Arabidopsis leads to growth retardation, altered leaf development with decreased cell size and viability, and early leaf senescence. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that increased <i>ANAC017</i> expression leads to higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial stress, cell death/autophagy, and leaf senescence under nonlimiting growth conditions as well as extensive repression of chloroplast function. Gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> analysis indicated that a complex hierarchy of transcription factors exists downstream of ANAC017. These involve a set of up-regulated ANAC and WRKY transcription factors associated with organellar signaling and senescence. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> also includes a number of ethylene- and gibberellic acid-related transcription factors with established functions in stress responses and growth regulation, which down-regulate their target genes. A number of BASIC LEUCINE-ZIPPER MOTIF transcription factors involved in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response or balancing of energy homeostasis via the SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 were also down-regulated by <i>ANAC017</i> overexpression. Our results show that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane tethering of the constitutively expressed ANAC017, and its controlled release, are crucial to fine-tune a fast reactive but potentially harmful signaling cascade. Thus, ANAC017 is a master regulator of cellular responses with mitochondria acting as central sensors.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit development remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry development, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early development, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry development. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that characterizes the whole process of berry development, providing a framework to model fruit development and maturation in grapevine.</p>

Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and immobile regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise distribution of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional imaging using superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was distributed to immobile ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into immobile ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the immobile tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are distributed to immobile tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Mycorrhiza-Triggered Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Networks Impinge on Herbivore Fitness
<p>Symbioses between plants and mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous in ecosystems and strengthen the plants’ defense against aboveground herbivores. Here, we studied the underlying regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s and biochemical mechanisms in leaves induced by ectomycorrhizae that modify herbivore interactions. Feeding damage and oviposition by the widespread poplar leaf beetle <i>Chrysomela populi</i> were reduced on the ectomycorrhizal hybrid poplar <i>Populus</i> × <i>canescens</i>. Integration of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and volatile emission patterns via mass difference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s demonstrated changes in nitrogen allocation in the leaves of mycorrhizal poplars, down-regulation of phenolic pathways, and up-regulation of defensive systems, including protease inhibitors, chitinases, and aldoxime biosynthesis. Ectomycorrhizae had a systemic influence on jasmonate-related signaling transcripts. Our results suggest that ectomycorrhizae prime wounding responses and shift resources from constitutive phenol-based to specialized protective compounds. Consequently, symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal fungi enabled poplars to respond to leaf beetle feeding with a more effective arsenal of defense mechanisms compared with nonmycorrhizal poplars, thus demonstrating the importance of belowground plant-microbe associations in mitigating aboveground biotic stress.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed coat mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed coat mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed coat in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed coat mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> involved in seed coat mucilage formation.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Increases Production of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Hydrogen Peroxide and Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidic Acid in Guard Cell Signaling<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in plants that participates in stress responses and development. <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase 1, one of the enzymatic sources of H<sub>2</sub>S in plants, participates in abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal closure and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in Arabidopsis guard cells. Additionally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and stomatal movement. The PLDα1 and PLDδ isoforms were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure, and most of the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production required the activity of PLDα1. Finally, we showed that H<sub>2</sub>S induced increases in the PLDδ-derived phosphatidic acid levels in guard cells. Our results revealed the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in the signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that controls stomatal closure, and suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates NADPH oxidase and PLD activity in guard cells.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>ACTIN-DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR3</i> Is Required for Controlling Aphid Feeding from the Phloem
<p>The actin cytoskeleton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> has an important role in plant cell growth, division, and stress response. Actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are a group of actin-binding proteins that contribute to reorganization of the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ADF3</i> is required in the phloem for controlling infestation by <i>Myzus persicae</i> Sulzer, commonly known as the green peach aphid (GPA), which is an important phloem sap-consuming pest of more than fifty plant families. In agreement with a role for the actin-depolymerizing function of ADF3 in defense against the GPA, we show that resistance in <i>adf3</i> was restored by overexpression of the related ADF4 and the actin cytoskeleton destabilizers, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B. Electrical monitoring of the GPA feeding behavior indicates that the GPA stylets found sieve elements faster when feeding on the <i>adf3</i> mutant compared to the wild-type plant. In addition, once they found the sieve elements, the GPA fed for a more prolonged period from sieve elements of <i>adf3</i> compared to the wild-type plant. The longer feeding period correlated with an increase in fecundity and population size of the GPA and a parallel reduction in callose deposition in the <i>adf3</i> mutant. The <i>adf3</i>-conferred susceptibility to GPA was overcome by expression of the <i>ADF3</i> coding sequence from the phloem-specific <i>SUC2</i> promoter, thus confirming the importance of <i>ADF3</i> function in the phloem. We further demonstrate that the <i>ADF3</i>-dependent defense mechanism is linked to the transcriptional up-regulation of <i>PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4</i>, which is an important regulator of defenses against the GPA.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and abnormal pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced pollen exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in the regulation of anther development and pollen exine formation.</p>

Argonaute 8 (AGO8) Mediates the Elicitation of Direct Defenses against Herbivory
<p>In <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>, specific RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdR1) and the Dicer-like (DCL3 and DCL4) proteins are recruited during herbivore attack to mediate the regulation of defense responses. However, the identity and role(s) of Argonautes (AGOs) involved in herbivory remain unknown. Of the 11 AGOs in the <i>N. attenuata</i> genome, we silenced the expression of 10. Plants silenced in <i>NaAGO8</i> expression grew normally but were highly susceptible to herbivore attack. Larvae of <i>Manduca sexta</i> grew faster when consuming inverted-repeat stable transformants (ir<i>AGO8</i>) plants but did not differ from the wild type when consuming plants silenced in <i>AGO1</i> (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>), <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO4</i> (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), <i>AGO7</i>, or <i>AGO10</i> expression. ir<i>AGO8</i> plants were significantly compromised in herbivore-induced levels of defense metabolites such as nicotine, phenolamides, and diterpenoid glycosides. Time-course analyses revealed extensively altered microRNA profiles and the reduced accumulation of <i>MYB8</i> transcripts and of the associated genes of the phenolamide and phenylpropanoid pathways as well as the nicotine biosynthetic pathway. A possible AGO8-modulated microRNA-messenger RNA target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> was inferred. Furthermore, comparative analysis of domains revealed the diversity of AGO conformations, particularly in the small RNA-binding pocket, which may influence substrate recognition/binding and functional specificity. We infer that AGO8 plays a central role in the induction of direct defenses by modulating several regulatory nodes in the defense signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> during herbivore response. Thus, our study identifies the effector AGO of the herbivore-induced small RNA machinery, which in <i>N. attenuata</i> now comprises RdR1, DCL3/4, and AGO8.</p>

TransDetect Identifies a New Regulatory Module Controlling Phosphate Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Identifying transcription factor (TFs) cooperation controlling target gene expression is still an arduous challenge. The accuracy of current methods at genome scale significantly drops with the increase in number of genes, which limits their applicability to more complex genomes, like animals and plants. Here, we developed an algorithm, TransDetect, able to predict TF combinations controlling the expression level of a given gene. TransDetect was used to identify novel TF modules regulating the expression of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) phosphate transporter <i>PHO1;H3</i> comprising MYB15, MYB84, bHLH35, and ICE1. These TFs were confirmed to interact between themselves and with the <i>PHO1;H3</i> promoter. Phenotypic and genetic analyses of TF mutants enable the organization of these four TFs and <i>PHO1;H3</i> in a new gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> controlling phosphate accumulation in zinc-dependent manner. This demonstrates the potential of TransDetect to extract directionality in nondynamic transcriptomes and to provide a blueprint to identify gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> involved in a given biological process.</p>

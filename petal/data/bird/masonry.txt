Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less THA using a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic femoral head and liner. At   each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded.   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable wear, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of   fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner at the time of surgery. One hip   was revised for a periprosthetic fracture of the femur, and one   hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection.

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>s containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>. The use of a vacuum during mixing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>s containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative mortality compared   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less THA. Our aim was to investigate this through a nationwide   matched cohort study adjusting for age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic   background.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 178 784 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent   either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less THA from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register were matched with 862 294 controls from the general population.   Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA had an increased risk of   death during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in risk of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than controls. Patients selected for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ation of the   femoral component was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed acetabular component combined with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   femoral component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early mortality that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.   The absolute increase in risk is very small. Our findings lend support   to the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ation of the femoral component is more dangerous   than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ation of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:37–43.</p></sec>

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed humeral components and   3469 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively.

Cement-in-cement revision of the femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Compared with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), revision   surgery can be challenging. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> femoral revision   technique involves removing a femoral component from a well-fixed   femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ing a new stem into the original   mantle. This technique is widely used and when carried out for the   correct indications, is fast, relatively inexpensive and carries   a reduced short-term risk for the patient compared with the alternative   of removing well-fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>. We report the outcomes of this procedure   when two commonly used femoral stems are used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 1179 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> stem revisions involving   an Exeter or a Lubinus stem reported to the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register (SHAR) between January 1999 and December 2015.

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite coatings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed designs, but may   only coat the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial component fixation   of un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed PA-coated TKAs <i>versus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-coated or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed PA-coated tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-coated tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-coated tibial components. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-coated component <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed component).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial components of PA-coated TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs.

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>Tec Biolox products.   Revisions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing fractures   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic has greatly reduced   the odds of head fracture but not of liner fracture.

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed acetabular components as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty. Used   as a local treatment, a higher local dose of bisphosphonate can   be achieved without systemic exposure. We wished to see if this   principle could be applied usefully in total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with   60 participants, we compressed gauze soaked in bisphosphonate solution   (ibandronate) or saline against the acetabular bone bed immediately   before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ing the acetabular component. RSA, classification of   radiolucent lines, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario McMasters   Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were carried out at three-,   six-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed acetabular component relative to the   pelvis was reduced by movement almost half in the ibandronate group,   when measured as maximum total point or as movement of the femoral   head (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively).

Continuous distal migration and internal rotation of the C-stem prosthesis without any adverse clinical effects
<p>In 2005, we demonstrated that the polished triple-tapered   C-stem at two years had migrated distally and rotated internally.   From that series, 33 patients have now been followed radiologically,   clinically and by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) for up to ten   years. The distal migration within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle had continued   and reached a mean of 2 mm (0.5 to 4.0) at ten years. Internal rotation,   also within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle, was a mean 3.8° (external 1.6° to   internal 6.6°) The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle did not show any sign of migration   or loosening in relation to the femoral bone.

A molecular perovskite solid solution with piezoelectricity stronger than lead zirconate titanate
<p>Piezoelectric materials produce electricity when strained, making them ideal for different types of sensing applications. The most effective piezoelectric materials are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic solid solutions in which the piezoelectric effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics are not ideal for a variety of applications owing to some of their mechanical properties. We synthesized piezoelectric materials from a molecular perovskite (TMFM)<i><sub>x</sub></i>(TMCM)<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>CdCl<sub>3</sub> solid solution (TMFM, trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium; TMCM, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium, 0 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 1), in which the MPB exists between monoclinic and hexagonal phases. We found a composition for which the piezoelectric coefficient <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> is ~1540 picocoulombs per newton, comparable to high-performance piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics. The material has potential applications for wearable piezoelectric devices.</p>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong> planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.</p>

Pcdhαc2 is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries in mice
<p>Serotonergic neurons project their axons pervasively throughout the brain and innervate various target fields in a space-filling manner, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong>d arrangements of their axon terminals to allow optimal allocation of serotonin among target neurons. Here we show that conditional deletion of the mouse protocadherin α (<i>Pcdh</i>α) gene cluster in serotonergic neurons disrupts local axonal tiling and global assembly of serotonergic circuitries and results in depression-like behaviors. Genetic dissection and expression profiling revealed that this role is specifically mediated by Pcdhαc2, which is the only Pcdhα isoform expressed in serotonergic neurons. We conclude that, in contrast to neurite self-avoidance, which requires single-cell identity mediated by Pcdh diversity, a single cell-type identity mediated by the common C-type Pcdh isoform is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19).

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its pla<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition domain to intracellular signaling domains to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ signaling domains are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and toxicity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent signaling cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced phosphorylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s activated similar signaling intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein phosphorylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like phenotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 signaling domain demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR signal intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this domain in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR signaling pathways cannot be predicted solely by the domains used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> the receptor and that signal strength is a key determinant of T cell fate. Thus, tailoring CAR design based on signal strength may lead to improved clinical efficacy and reduced toxicity.</p>

This robust material system is ideal for thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, such as those encountered by spacecraft.</p>

Single-component quasicrystalline nanocrystal superlattices through flexible polygon tiling rule
<p>Quasicrystalline superlattices (QC-SLs) generated from single-component colloidal building blocks have been predicted by computer simulations but are challenging to reproduce experimentally. We discovered that 10-fold QC-SLs could self-organize from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots with anisotropic patchiness. Transmission electron microscopy and tomography measurements allow structural re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion of the QC-SL from the nanoscale packing to the atomic-scale orientation alignments. The unique QC order leads to a tiling concept, the “flexible polygon tiling rule,” that replicates the experimental observations. The keys for the single-component QC-SL formation were identified to be the anisotropic shape and patchiness of the building blocks and the assembly microscopic environment. Our discovery may spur the creation of various superstructures using anisotropic objects through an enthalpy-driven route.</p>

Topological protection of biphoton states
<p>The robust generation and propagation of multiphoton quantum states are crucial for applications in quantum information, computing, and communications.

The recent discoveries regarding topological phases have introduced avenues to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> quantum systems that are protected against scattering and imperfections. We experimentally demonstrate topological protection of biphoton states, the building block for quantum information systems.

Building superlattices from individual nanoparticles via template-confined DNA-mediated assembly
<p>DNA programmable assembly has been combined with top-down lithography to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> superlattices of discrete, reconfigurable nanoparticle architectures on a gold surface over large areas. Specifically, the assembly of individual colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes is controlled by oligonucleotides containing “locked” nucleic acids and confined environments provided by polymer pores to yield oriented architectures that feature tunable arrangements and independently controllable distances at both nanometer- and micrometer-length scales. These structures, which would be difficult to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> by other common assembly methods, provide a platform to systematically study and control light-matter interactions in nanoparticle-based optical materials. The generality and potential of this approach are explored by identifying a broadband absorber with a solvent polarity response that allows dynamic tuning of visible light absorption.</p>

Multiplexed gene synthesis in emulsions for exploring protein functional landscapes
<p>Improving our ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> and functionally characterize DNA sequences would broadly accelerate progress in biology. Here, we introduce DropSynth, a scalable, low-cost method to build thousands of defined gene-length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s in a pooled (multiplexed) manner. DropSynth uses a library of barcoded beads that pull down the oligonucleotides necessary for a gene’s assembly, which are then processed and assembled in water-in-oil emulsions. We used DropSynth to successfully build more than 7000 synthetic genes that encode phylogenetically diverse homologs of two essential genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We tested the ability of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase homologs to complement a knockout <i>E. coli</i> strain in multiplex, revealing core functional motifs and reasons underlying homolog incompatibility. DropSynth coupled with multiplexed functional assays allows us to rationally explore sequence-function relationships at an unprecedented scale.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined structure is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nanostructures, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> diverse multikilobase single-stranded structures, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA structure and a ~6000-nt RNA structure. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing complex and replicable nucleic acid nanostructures, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

The image-forming mirror in the eye of the scallop
<p>Scallops possess a visual system comprising up to 200 eyes, each containing a concave mirror rather than a lens to focus light. The hierarchical organization of the multilayered mirror is controlled for image formation, from the component guanine crystals at the nanoscale to the complex three-dimensional morphology at the millimeter level. The layered structure of the mirror is tuned to reflect the wavelengths of light penetrating the scallop’s habitat and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong>d with a mosaic of square guanine crystals, which reduces optical aberrations. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina used for separately imaging the peripheral and central fields of view. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong>d, off-axis mirror of the scallop eye bears a striking resemblance to the segmented mirrors of reflecting telescopes.</p>

Formation of α-chiral centers by asymmetric β-C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–H arylation, alkenylation, and alkynylation
<p>The enzymatic β-C–H hydroxylation of the feedstock chemical isobutyric acid has enabled the asymmetric synthesis of a wide variety of polyketides. The analogous transition metal–catalyzed enantioselective β-C–H functionalization of isobutyric acid–derived substrates should provide a versa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong> method for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing useful building blocks with enantioenriched α-chiral centers from this abundant C-4 skeleton. However, the desymmetrization of ubiquitous isopropyl moieties by organometallic catalysts has remained an unanswered challenge. Herein, we report the design of chiral mono-protected aminomethyl oxazoline ligands that enable desymmetrization of isopropyl groups via palladium insertion into the C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–H bonds of one of the prochiral methyl groups. We detail the enantioselective β-arylation, -alkenylation, and -alkynylation of isobutyric acid/2-aminoisobutyric acid derivatives, which may serve as a platform for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion of α-chiral centers.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant biology has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of biologically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 biology.</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have been found in plants, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in plants. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression system via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> the small RNA overexpression system. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this system, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through designing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this system could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpression system could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in plants.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following revision surgery of metal-on-metal   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to metal   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing revision surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following revision were   intra-operative complications, mortality and re-revision surgery.   Predictors of re-revision were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operative complications occurred in 40 revisions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic revision bearings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07).

Kudo type-5 total elbow arthroplasty for patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We assessed the long-term (more than ten-year) outcomes of the   Kudo type-5 elbow prosthesis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis   (RA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 41 elbows (Larsen Grade IV, n = 21; Grade V, n =   20) in 31 patients with RA who had undergone a Kudo type-5 total   elbow arthroplasty (TEA) between 1994 and 2003, and had been followed   up for more than ten years. The humeral component was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   and the all-polyethylene ulnar component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed in every patient. Clinical   outcome was assessed using the Mayo elbow performance score. We   calculated the revision rate and evaluated potential risk factors   for revision. The duration of follow-up was a mean 141 months (120   to 203).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Aseptic loosening of the ulnar component occurred in 11 elbows.   There was no radiolucency around any humeral component. There was   one deep infection. The survival rate according to Kaplan-Meier   survivorship analysis was 87.8% after five years and 70.7% after   ten years. The range of extension/flexion was a mean -38° (-80°   to 0°)/105° (30° to 150°) before surgery and -40° (-70° to -20°)/132°   (100° to 150°) at the final follow-up, while the mean Mayo elbow performance   score was 43 before surgery and 80 at final follow-up. Disease duration   of RA up to the TEA of < 15 years and a pre-operative range of   movement (ROM) of > 85° were significant risk factors for revision   or aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although Kudo type-5 prostheses gave satisfactory results in   the short-term, aseptic loosening increased after five years. In   most cases, elbow function was maintained in the long-term without   loosening of the implant.

Early migration of a partially cemented fluted glenoid component inserted using a cannulated preparation system
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) allows an extremely accurate   measurement of early micromotion of components following arthroplasty. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this study, RSA was used to measure the migration of 11 partially   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed fluted pegged glenoid components in patients with osteoarthritis   who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty using an improved surgical   technique (seven men, four women, mean age 68). Patients were evaluated   clinically using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES)   and Constant-Murley scores and by CT scans two years post-operatively. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were two patterns of migration, the first showing little,   if any, migration and the second showing rotation by > 6° as early   as three months post-operatively. At two years, these two groups   could be confirmed on CT scans, one with osseointegration around   the central peg, and the second with cystic changes. Patients with   osteolysis around the central peg were those with early migration   and those with osseointegration had minimal early migration. Both groups,however,had   similar clinical results. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rapid early migration associated with focal lucency and absence   of osseointegration was observed in three of 11 glenoid components,   suggesting that lack of initial stability leads to early movement   and failure of osseointegration.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:674–9.</p></sec>

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   risk factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-tapered   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   identified. Level of pre-operative osteoarthritis, femoral Dorr   type and cortical index were recorded. Varus/valgus pla<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> of   the stem and canal fill ratio were recorded post-operatively. Periprosthetic   fractures were identified and classified according to the Vancouver   classification. Regression analysis was performed to identify risk   factors for early periprosthetic fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 713 days (1 to 2058). A total of 48 periprosthetic   fractures (3.0%) were identified during the follow-up and median   time until fracture was 16 days, (interquar<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong> range 10 to 31.5).   Patients with femoral Dorr type C had a 5.2 times increased risk   of post-operative periprosthetic fracture compared with type B,   while female patients had a near significant two times increased   risk over time for post-operative fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dorr type C is an independent risk factor for early periprosthetic   fracture, following THA using a double tapered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less stem such   as the Bi-Metric.

Proximal femoral replacement in contemporary revision total hip arthroplasty for severe femoral bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Loss or absence of proximal femoral bone in revision total hip   arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant challenge. While the main   indication for the use of proximal femoral repla<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>s (PFRs) is   in the treatment of malignant disease, they have a valuable role   in revision THA for loosening, fracture and infection in patients   with bone loss. Our aim was to determine the clinical outcomes,   implant survivorship, and complications of PFRs used in revision   THA for indications other than malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review of 44 patients who underwent revision   THA using a PFR between 2000 and 2013 was undertaken. Their mean   age was 79 years (53 to 97); 31 (70%) were women. The bone loss   was classified as Paprosky IIIB or IV in all patients. The mean   follow-up was six years (2 to 12), at which time 22 patients had   died and five were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 42.8 (25.9 to 82.9) pre-operatively   to 68.5 (21.0 to 87.7) post-operatively (p = 0.0009). A total of   two PFRs had been revised, one for periprosthetic infection eight   years post-operatively and one for aseptic loosening six years post-operatively.   The Kaplan-Meier survivorship free of any revision or removal of   an implant was 86% at five years and 66% years at ten years. A total   of 12 patients (27%) had a complication including six with a dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PFRs provide a useful salvage option for patients, particularly   the elderly with massive proximal femoral bone loss who require   revision THA, with significant clinical improvement. While the survivorship   of the implant is good at five years, dislocation continues to be   the most common complication. The judicious use of larger femoral   heads, dual-mobility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s, or constrained liners may help   to minimise the risk of dislocation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:325–9.</p></sec>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of impaction   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular defects in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. Impaction bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   defects. The precepts of modern, revision impaction grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary defects must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously impacted morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> is used to stabilise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the revised   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique. While   having its limitations, it is a viable option to address large acetabular   defects in revision arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):25–30.</p>

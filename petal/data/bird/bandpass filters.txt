Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>s to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong>s, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong>s, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong>. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong> Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong> (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong> performance.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> magnetic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferromagnetic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks
<p>Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell signaling pathways somehow integrate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, integrative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ed network (CFN) approach revealed that cell signaling pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then integrated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell signaling pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell signaling pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive “OR” gates determine a large number of signal transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings reveal that cell signaling pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ed genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

Ultrafast optical pulse shaping using dielectric metasurfaces
<p>Advances in ultrafast lasers, chirped pulse amplifiers, and frequency comb technology require fundamentally new pulse-modulation strategies capable of supporting unprecedentedly large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong> and high peak power while maintaining high spectral resolution. We demonstrate how dielectric metasurfaces can be leveraged to shape the temporal profile of a near-infrared femtosecond pulse. Finely tailored pulse-shaping operations, including splitting, compression, chirping, and higher-order distortion, are achieved using a Fourier-transform setup embedding metasurfaces able to manipulate, simultaneously and independently, the amplitude and phase of the constituent frequency components of the pulse. Exploiting metasurfaces to manipulate the temporal characteristics of light expands their impact and opens new vistas in the field of ultrafast science and technology.</p>

Shifting habitat mosaics and fish production across river basins
<p>Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing river, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmon that support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of fish at the scale of the entire basin.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic circuits.</p>

Molecular basis for pore blockade of human Na<sup>+</sup> channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 by the μ-conotoxin KIIIA

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory

We demonstrate a single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the device resets.

Controlling learning and epilepsy together
<p>The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the hippocampus of the brain that is important for many cognitive functions, such as spatial learning and memory, and understanding our environment or context (<i>1</i>). The DG is also considered to be important in many diseases, some of which surprisingly do not appear to be related to memory, such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (<i>2</i>). One explanation is based on the idea that the DG is an inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> or gate (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>), preventing too much information from corrupting memory formation as well as preventing seizures. However, it is unclear exactly how and when the DG limits the influence of afferent input to the hippocampus, and when the DG is permissive, because the DG has powerful excitatory and inhibitory characteristics. For example, the DG contains mossy cells (MCs), which have both characteristics (<i>5</i>). On page 787 of this issue, Bui <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) show that silencing MCs impairs a spatial memory task and also terminates seizures in an animal model of TLE, which could improve our understanding of TLE as well as cognitive comorbidities.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability

Our method avoids constraints related to doping and phase matching and therefore can occur in a wider pool of glasses and crystals even at far-infrared frequencies and for single-cycle pulses. Such amplified pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly excited states in gases.</p>

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A laser is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in lasers with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a laser has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in fiber lasers can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing.

Loss of a mammalian circular RNA locus causes miRNA deregulation and affects brain function

When the <i>Cdr1as</i> locus was removed from the mouse genome, knockout animals displayed impaired sensorimotor gating—a deficit in the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> out unnecessary information—which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Our data indicate an in vivo loss-of-function circRNA phenotype and suggest that interactions between Cdr1as and miRNAs are important for normal brain function.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees.

Illuminating the Base of the Annelid Tree Using Transcriptomics
<p>Annelida is one of three animal groups possessing segmentation and is central in considerations about the evolution of different character traits. It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750–170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our reconstruction of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and deposit feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or grooved palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia bearing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.</p>

Hearing threshold shifts and recovery after noise exposure in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>Temporary threshold shift (TTS) after loud noise exposure was investigated in a male and a female beluga whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The thresholds were evaluated using the evoked-potential technique, which allowed for threshold tracing with a resolution of ~1 min. The fatiguing noise had a 0.5 octave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong>, with center frequencies ranging from 11.2 to 90 kHz, a level of 165 dB re. 1 μPa and exposure durations from 1 to 30 min. The effects of the noise were tested at probe frequencies ranging from −0.5 to +1.5 octaves relative to the noise center frequency. The effect was estimated in terms of both immediate (1.5 min) post-exposure TTS and recovery duration. The highest TTS with the longest recovery duration was produced by noises of lower frequencies (11.2 and 22.5 kHz) and appeared at a test frequency of +0.5 octave. At higher noise frequencies (45 and 90 kHz), the TTS decreased. The TTS effect gradually increased with prolonged exposures ranging from 1 to 30 min. There was a considerable TTS difference between the two subjects.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. To maintain activity across a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates bacterial surface sensing
<p>It is critical for bacteria to recognize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact and initiate physiological changes required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-associated lifestyles. Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in sensing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and facilitating downstream behaviors, but the mechanism by which pili mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing has been unclear. We visualized <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> pili undergoing dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact, these cycles ceased, which coincided with synthesis of the adhesive holdfast required for attachment. Physically blocking pili imposed resistance to pilus retraction, which was sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact. Thus, to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, bacteria use the resistance on retracting, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-bound pili that occurs upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact.</p>

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e transcriptome becomes derepressed at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e information over the course of the night.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-active molecules that can lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as well as insoluble lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants. Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants showed strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e activity that reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

The TRPM2 channel is a hypothalamic heat sensor that limits fever and can drive hypothermia
<p>Body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the nervous system. The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and regulates internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons. TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels in monitoring internal body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e should promote further analysis of molecular mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic circuits involved with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p>Heat stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that heat shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in heat tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. High ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in barley.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nanograined materials is their strong tendency to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coars</span></strong>en at elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. As grain size decreases into the nanoscale, grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coars</span></strong>ening occurs at much lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es, as low as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for some metals.

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (2°C) below and above their habitat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e abundance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was abundant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc abundance at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst geometries. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms lead to tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet thickness. Atomic-level control of thickness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

Observation of topological superconductivity on the surface of an iron-based superconductor

The initial dissociation probability of methane on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for methane C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert methane to value-added products.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

The Little Ice Age and 20th-century deep Pacific cooling
<p>Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent cooling occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e trends in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.</p>

Global extent of rivers and streams
<p>The turbulent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es of rivers and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere.

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a material’s catalytic properties requires identifying structural features that give rise to active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor
<p>When bacteria encounter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, they respond with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e colonization and virulence induction. The mechanisms of bacterial mechanosensation and downstream signaling remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a tactile sensing cascade in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> in which the flagellar motor acts as sensor. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-induced motor interference stimulated the production of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate by the motor-associated diguanylate cyclase DgcB. This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a polysaccharide adhesin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli. Thus, the bacterial flagellar motor acts as a tetherless sensor reminiscent of mechanosensitive channels.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where carbon monoxide plus water yields dihydrogen and carbon dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and carbon monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations. This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low working <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Potential application in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the working <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units.

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown.

Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in plants.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In developing seeds, this response is largely controlled by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic control of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely controlled by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is controlled by a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral endocytosis before ADAM10 processing
<p>The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by cell-cell contact, is a major regulator of cell fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e as a heterodimer of the Notch extracellular domain associated with the transmembrane and intracellular domains. After ligand binding, Notch undergoes proteolysis, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that regulates gene expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of Notch1-expressing cells. We found that, upon ligand binding, Notch1 at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e was ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the internalization of the Notch1 extracellular domain by the ligand-expressing cell and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by the Notch1-expressing cell, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10 generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the NICD, which has been thought to occur at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. However, we found that blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intracellular compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces

We report that activation of the carbon (C)–fluorine (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling directly on metal oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes directly on the rutile titania <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors.

The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es.</p>

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory

Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e, exposed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation
<p>The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earth’s history when global mean sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, reconstructions of LIG global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2°C warmer than present-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Here we use a network of sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global mean annual SSTs were 0.5 ± 0.3°C warmer than the climatological mean from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 mean. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 mean in response to reduced mean annual insolation.</p>

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e elemental composition of dwarf planet Ceres constrains its regolith ice content, aqueous alteration processes, and interior evolution. Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e materials were processed by the action of water within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres’ carbon-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of hydrogen to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest ice-rock fractionation, resulting in differences between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and bulk composition. At mid-to-high latitudes, the regolith contains high concentrations of hydrogen, consistent with broad expanses of water ice, confirming theoretical predictions that ice can survive for billions of years just beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

A Temperature-Sensitive Misfolded bri1-301 Receptor Requires Its Kinase Activity to Promote Growth
<p>BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) is a leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase that functions as the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e receptor for brassinosteroids (BRs). Previous studies showed that BRI1 requires its kinase activity to transduce the extracellular BR signal into the nucleus. Among the many reported mutant <i>bri1</i> alleles, <i>bri1-301</i> is unique, as its glycine-989-to-isoleucine mutation completely inhibits its kinase activity in vitro but only gives rise to a weak dwarf phenotype compared with strong or null <i>bri1</i> alleles, raising the question of whether kinase activity is essential for the biological function of BRI1. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) bri1-301 mutant receptor exhibits weak BR-triggered phosphorylation in vivo and absolutely requires its kinase activity for the limited growth that occurs in the <i>bri1-301</i> mutant. We also show that bri1-301 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-sensitive misfolded protein that is rapidly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane by yet unknown mechanisms. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increase from 22°C to 29°C reduced the protein stability and biochemical activity of bri1-301, likely due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-enhanced protein misfolding. The bri1-301 protein could be used as a model to study the degradation machinery for misfolded membrane proteins with cytosolic structural lesions and the plasma membrane-associated protein quality-control mechanism.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for ablation. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in the bone during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy
<p>Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments conducted with compositionally asymmetric low molar mass poly(isoprene)-<i>b</i>-poly(lactide) diblock copolymers reveal an extraordinary thermal history dependence. The development of distinct periodic crystalline or aperiodic quasicrystalline states depends on how specimens are cooled from the disordered state to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es below the order-disorder transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Whereas direct cooling leads to the formation of documented morphologies, rapidly quenched samples that are then heated from low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e form the hexagonal C14 and cubic C15 Laves phases commonly found in metal alloys. Self-consistent mean-field theory calculations show that these, and other associated Frank-Kasper phases, have nearly degenerate free energies, suggesting that processing history drives the material into long-lived metastable states defined by self-assembled particles with discrete populations of volumes and polyhedral shapes.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive radiative cooling draws heat from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and radiates it into space as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Emergence of hierarchical structural complexities in nanoparticles and their assembly
<p>We demonstrate that nanoparticle self-assembly can reach the same level of hierarchy, complexity, and accuracy as biomolecules. The precise assembly structures of gold nanoparticles (246 gold core atoms with 80 <i>p</i>-methylbenzenethiolate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e ligands) at the atomic, molecular, and nanoscale levels were determined from x-ray diffraction studies. We identified the driving forces and rules that guide the multiscale assembly behavior. The protecting ligands self-organize into rotational and parallel patterns on the nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e via C-H⋅⋅⋅π interaction, and the symmetry and density of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e patterns dictate directional packing of nanoparticles into crystals with orientational, rotational, and translational orders. Through hierarchical interactions and symmetry matching, the simple building blocks evolve into complex structures, representing an emergent phenomenon in the nanoparticle system.</p>

Rosetta’s comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the colors of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in color are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e properti</span></strong>es.</p>

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is generally only found beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> ice–rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO<sub>2</sub> ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO<sub>2</sub> ice and the depth of the eroded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e layer. We interpret the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the comet.</p>

Nobel honors discoveries in how cells eat themselves
<p>As the stench of the streets during a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">garbag</span></strong>e strike quickly drives home, sanitation workers are the unsung heroes of modern cities and towns. Similarly, the cell's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">garbag</span></strong>e collectors are key to health. By performing "autophagy"—literally, self-eating—they degrade or recycle toxic protein aggregates and cell components. This week, the cell biologist who worked out the genetics and mechanics of this process received the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. When Yoshinori Ohsumi, now at the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Frontier Research Center, did his pioneering work in yeast in the early 1990s, his results drew little attention outside cell biology. But in the past 15 years, others have shown that cells' clean-up machinery is crucial to human health.</p>

A finer look at a fine cellular meshwork
<p>Students learning about the eukaryotic cell are taught that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, the nucleus is the information storehouse, and lysosomes are the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">garbag</span></strong>e disposal. Summing up the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is more problematic, even for professional cell biologists. Classically, the ER is where membrane proteins, secreted proteins, and most lipids are synthesized. It is also the site of calcium regulation. More recent work shows that it is the site of antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, and the location of the unfolded protein response, now thought to be central to several major diseases. A new frontier is its relationships with other organelles (<i>1</i>). On page 433 of this issue, Nixon-Abell <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe how an armamentarium of superresolution imaging techniques reveals new aspects of the ER's very heterogeneous morphology. Indeed, the “form follows function” adage may help to make sense of this organelle's functional issues.</p>

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong> ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the activity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced activation or inhibition of MR activity, we studied the response to eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not activated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s, and others required higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong> concentrations for activation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not activate full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>s had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained activity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the activation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist activity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Nongenomic Thyroid Hormone Signaling Occurs Through a Plasma Membrane–Localized Receptor
<sec><title>Rapidly Promoting Bone Growth from the Membrane</title><p>Thyroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es regulate many processes, including bone turnover.

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation resolution counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes resolution, inhibition of ERK activation delayed resolution, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation resolution in settings where defective resolution promotes disease progression.</p>

Stromal <i>Gli2</i> activity coordinates a niche signaling program for mammary epithelial stem cells
<p>The stem cell niche is a complex local signaling microenvironment that sustains stem cell activity during organ maintenance and regeneration. The mammary gland niche must support its associated stem cells while also responding to systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al regulation that triggers pubertal changes. We find that <i>Gli2</i>, the major Hedgehog pathway transcriptional effector, acts within mouse mammary stromal cells to direct a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-responsive niche signaling program by activating expression of factors that regulate epithelial stem cells as well as receptors for the mammatrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es estrogen and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e.

Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant growth and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es, especially in the regulation of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA promotes the accumulation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the regulation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, <i>ABI4</i> is transcriptionally repressed by EIN3 in ethylene-regulated AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Via transcriptome analysis and molecular and genetic experiments, we identified <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i>as the direct target of ABI4 in the regulation of AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation. Thus, the EIN3-ABI4- <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i> transcriptional cascade involves a mechanism by which ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation in response to complex environmental stimuli.</p>

A Methyltransferase Trio Essential for Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis and Growth
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a primary class of membrane lipids in most eukaryotes. In plants, the primary PC biosynthetic pathway and its role in plant growth and development remain elusive due to lack of a mutant model with substantially decreased PC content. Recently, a double mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PHOSPHO-BASE <i>N</i>-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (PMT1) and PMT3 was reported with reduced PC content and defective plant growth. However, residual PC content as well as the nonlethal phenotype of the mutant suggests an additional enzyme contributes to PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In this article, we report on the role of three PMTs in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant development, with a focus on PMT2. <i>PMT2</i> had the highest expression level among the three PMTs, and it was highly expressed in roots. The <i>pmt1 pmt2</i> double mutant enhanced the defects in root growth, cell viability, and PC content of <i>pmt1</i>, suggesting that PMT2 functions together with PMT1 in roots. Chemical inhibition of PMT activity in wild-type roots reproduced the short root phenotype observed in <i>pmt1 pmt2</i>, suggesting that PMT1 and PMT2 are the major PMT isoforms in roots. In shoots, <i>pmt1 pmt2 pmt3</i> enhanced the phenotype of <i>pmt1 pmt3</i>, showing seedling lethality and further reduced PC content without detectable de novo PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. These results suggest that PMTs catalyze an essential reaction step in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and that the three PMTs have differential tissue-specific functions in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant growth.</p>

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in temperate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in cotton.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit coloration is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit coloration as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration in apple.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus formation. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus formation, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus formation. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus formation. In addition to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus formation.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>al glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>zed from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong> 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato.</p>

Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al regulation of cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle formation during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle formation in three ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax formation. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle formation in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle formation: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The genetic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s across eudicot and monocot species under heat stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>S PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to heat stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of chlorophyll after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Regulation of Strigolactone Biosynthesis by Gibberellin Signaling
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es that regulate diverse physiological processes, including shoot branching and root development. They also act as rhizosphere signaling molecules to stimulate the germination of root parasitic weeds and the branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Although various types of cross talk between SLs and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es have been reported in physiological analyses, the cross talk between gibberellin (GA) and SLs is poorly understood. We screened for chemicals that regulate the level of SLs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified GA as, to our knowledge, a novel SL-regulating molecule. The regulation of SL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by GA is dependent on the GA receptor GID1 and F-box protein GID2. GA treatment also reduced the infection of rice plants by the parasitic plant witchers weed (<i>Striga hermonthica</i>). These data not only demonstrate, to our knowledge, the novel plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e cross talk between SL and GA, but also suggest that GA can be used to control parasitic weed infections.</p>

Gametophyte Development Needs Mitochondrial Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Function
<p>Tetrapyrrole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is one of the most essential metabolic pathways in almost all organisms. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX in this pathway. Here, we report that mutation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPO-coding gene <i>At5g63290</i> (<i>AtHEMN1</i>) adversely affects silique length, ovule number, and seed set. <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes, but homozygous mutants were never recovered. Plants carrying <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte development, including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused polar nuclei. Improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm development. Consequently, embryo development was arrested at the globular stage. The mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic expression of <i>AtHEMN1</i>. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that <i>AtHEMN1</i> is expressed mainly in floral tissues and developing seeds. AtHEMN1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria. Loss of <i>AtHEMN1</i> function increased coproporphyrinogen III level and reduced protoporphyrinogen IX level, suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Blockage of tetrapyrrole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in the <i>AtHEMN1</i> mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs, as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Our results suggest that the accumulated ROS disrupts mitochondrial function by altering their membrane polarity in floral tissues. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in gametophyte and seed development and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in plant mitochondria.</p>

Localization and in-Vivo Characterization of <i>Thapsia garganica</i> CYP76AE2 Indicates a Role in Thapsigargin Biosynthesis
<p>The Mediterranean plant <i>Thapsia garganica</i> (dicot, Apiaceae), also known as deadly carrot, produces the highly toxic compound thapsigargin. This compound is a potent inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase calcium pump in mammals and is of industrial importance as the active moiety of the anticancer drug mipsagargin, currently in clinical trials. Knowledge of thapsigargin in planta storage and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s has been limited. Here, we present the putative second step in thapsigargin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, by showing that the cytochrome P450 TgCYP76AE2, transiently expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, converts epikunzeaol into epidihydrocostunolide. Furthermore, we show that thapsigargin is likely to be stored in secretory ducts in the roots. Transcripts from TgTPS2 (epikunzeaol synthase) and TgCYP76AE2 in roots were found only in the epithelial cells lining these secretory ducts. This emphasizes the involvement of these cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of thapsigargin. This study paves the way for further studies of thapsigargin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s.</p>

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es that regulate most plant life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit development. Here, we demonstrate the implication of GAs in ovule development. DELLA proteins, negative GA response regulators, act as positive factors for ovule integument development in a mechanism that involves transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS). The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i>ats-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round shape, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alteration in integuments that fail to fully develop and are shorter than in wild-type plants. <i>ats-1</i> also shows some GA-related phenotypes, for example, higher germination rates and early flowering. In fact, <i>ats-1</i> has elevated GA levels due to the activation of GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s genes, which indicates that ATS inhibits GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Moreover, DELLAs and ATS proteins interact, which suggests the formation of a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by ATS would result in the stabilization of DELLAs to ensure correct ATS-DELLA complex formation. The requirement of both activities to coordinate proper ovule development strongly argues that the ATS-DELLA complex acts as a key molecular factor. This work provides the first evidence for a role of GAs in ovule and seed development.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-like, glucagon-like, and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-releasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es PTHrP (parathyroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Ptch1 comprises two interacting extracellular domains, ECD1 and ECD2, and 12 transmembrane segments (TMs), with TMs 2 to 6 constituting the sterol-sensing domain (SSD). Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong>-shaped densities are resolved in both structures, one enclosed by ECD1/2 and the other in the membrane-facing cavity of the SSD.

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional regulation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen flavonol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive production of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 coregulate petunia scent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s genes. Furthermore, promoter-activation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by controlling <i>TRANSKETOLASE2</i> expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and act to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es, with the jasmonate-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

CYP76B74 Catalyzes the 3′′-Hydroxylation of Geranylhydroquinone in Shikonin Biosynthesis
<p>Shikonin and its derivatives are the most abundant naphthoquinone pigments formed in species of the medicinally and economically valuable Boraginaceae. A key step in the shikonin biosynthetic pathway, namely the C-3′′ hydroxylation of the prenylated phenolic intermediate geranylhydroquinone, is expected to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450. To identify cytochrome P450 candidates with transcription profiles similar to those of genes known to be involved in shikonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, we carried out coexpression analysis of transcriptome data sets of shikonin-proficient and shikonin-deficient cell lines and examined the spatial expression of candidate genes in different organs of <i>Arnebia euchroma</i>. In biochemical assays using geranylhydroquinone as the substrate, CYP76B74 exhibited geranylhydroquinone 3′′-hydroxylase activity and produced 3′′-hydroxy-geranylhydroquinone. In <i>CYP76B74</i> RNA interference <i>A. euchroma</i> hairy roots, shikonin derivative accumulation decreased dramatically, which demonstrated that CYP76B74 is required for shikonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in the plant. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that CYP76B74 belonged to the CYP76B subfamily and was most likely derived from an ancestral geraniol 10-hydroxylase. In a subcellular localization analysis, a GFP-CYP76B74 fusion localized to endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Our results demonstrate that CYP76B74 catalyzes the key hydroxylation step in shikonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s with high efficiency. The characterization of the CYP76B74 described here paves the way for further exploration of the ring closure reactions generating the naphthoquinone skeleton as well as for the alternative metabolism of geranylhydroquinone 3′′-hydroxylase to dihydroechinofuran.</p>

Reconfigured Cyanogenic Glucoside Biosynthesis in <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> Involves a Cytochrome P450 CYP706C55
<p>Cyanogenic glucosides are a class of specialized metabolites widespread in the plant kingdom. Cyanogenic glucosides are α-hydroxynitriles, and their hydrolysis releases toxic hydrogen cyanide, providing an effective chemical defense against herbivores. <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> is a cyanogenic tree, allocating up to 20% of leaf nitrogen to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of the cyanogenic monoglucoside, prunasin. Here, mass spectrometry analyses of <i>E. cladocalyx</i> tissues revealed spatial and ontogenetic variations in prunasin content, as well as the presence of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin in flower buds and flowers. The identification and biochemical characterization of the prunasin biosynthetic enzymes revealed a unique enzyme configuration for prunasin production in <i>E. cladocalyx</i>. This result indicates that a multifunctional cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP79A125, catalyzes the initial conversion of <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine into its corresponding aldoxime, phenylacetaldoxime; a function consistent with other members of the CYP79 family. In contrast to the single multifunctional CYP known from other plant species, the conversion of phenylacetaldoxime to the α-hydroxynitrile, mandelonitrile, is catalyzed by two distinct CYPs. CYP706C55 catalyzes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime, an unusual CYP reaction. The resulting phenylacetonitrile is subsequently hydroxylatedby CYP71B103 to form mandelonitrile. The final glucosylation step to yield prunasin is catalyzed by a UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT85A59. Members of the CYP706 family have not been reported previously to participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of cyanogenic glucosides, and the pathway structure in <i>E. cladocalyx</i> represents an example of convergent evolution in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of cyanogenic glucosides in plants.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although auxin is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the auxin-ethylene interplay during root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric auxin response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the auxin response transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both auxin and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic root growth of the auxin transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the auxin biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between auxin transport and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the auxin-ethylene cross talk necessary for root gravitropism.</p>

A Cycloheximide-Sensitive Step in Transverse Microtubule Array Patterning
<p>The growth properties of individual cells within a tissue determine plant morphology, and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubule arrays, determines cellular growth properties. We investigated the mechanisms governing the formation of transverse microtubule array patterns in axially growing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epidermal hypocotyl cells. Using quantitative imaging approaches, we mapped the transition of the cortical microtubule arrays into a transverse coaligned pattern after induction with auxin and gibberellic acid. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e induction led to an early loss of microtubule plus end density and a rotation toward oblique patterns. Beginning 30 min after induction, transverse microtubules appeared at the cell’s midzone concurrently with the loss of longitudinal polymers, eventually progressing apically and basally to remodel the array pattern. Based on the timing and known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-signaling pathways, we tested the hypothesis that the later events require de novo gene expression and, thus, constitute a level of genetic control over transverse patterning. We found that the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in a selective and reversible loss of transverse patterns that were replaced with radial-like pinwheel arrays exhibiting a split bipolar architecture centered at the cell’s midzone. Experiments using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e induction and CHX revealed that pinwheel arrays occur when transverse microtubules increase at the midzone but longitudinal microtubules in the split bipolar architecture are not suppressed. We propose that a key regulatory mechanism for creating the transverse microtubule coalignment in axially growing hypocotyls involves the expression of a CHX-sensitive factor that acts to suppress the nucleation of the longitudinally oriented polymers.</p>

Two Tabersonine 6,7-Epoxidases Initiate Lochnericine-Derived Alkaloid Biosynthesis in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>
<p>Lochnericine is a major monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) in the roots of Madagascar periwinkle (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>). Lochnericine is derived from the stereoselective C6,C7-epoxidation of tabersonine and can be metabolized further to generate other complex MIAs. While the enzymes responsible for its downstream modifications have been characterized, those involved in lochnericine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s remain unknown. By combining gene correlation studies, functional assays, and transient gene inactivation, we identified two highly conserved P450s that efficiently catalyze the epoxidation of tabersonine: tabersonine 6,7-epoxidase isoforms 1 and 2 (TEX1 and TEX2). Both proteins are quite divergent from the previously characterized tabersonine 2,3-epoxidase and are more closely related to tabersonine 16-hydroxylase, involved in vindoline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in leaves. Biochemical characterization of TEX1/2 revealed their strict substrate specificity for tabersonine and their inability to epoxidize 19-hydroxytabersonine, indicating that they catalyze the first step in the pathway leading to horhammericine production. <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> displayed complementary expression profiles, with <i>TEX1</i> expressed mainly in roots and <i>TEX2</i> in aerial organs. Our results suggest that <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> originated from a gene duplication event and later acquired divergent, organ-specific regulatory elements for lochnericine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s throughout the plant, as supported by the presence of lochnericine in flowers. Finally, through the sequential expression of <i>TEX1</i> and up to four other MIA biosynthetic genes in yeast, we reconstituted the 19-acetylhorhammericine biosynthetic pathway and produced tailor-made MIAs by mixing enzymatic modules that are naturally spatially separated in the plant. These results lay the groundwork for the metabolic engineering of tabersonine/lochnericine derivatives of pharmaceutical interest.</p>

Discovery, Biosynthesis and Stress-Related Accumulation of Dolabradiene-Derived Defenses in Maize<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Terpenoids are a major component of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) chemical defenses that mediate responses to herbivores, pathogens, and other environmental challenges. Here, we describe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and elicited production of a class of maize diterpenoids, named dolabralexins. Dolabralexin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s involves the sequential activity of two diterpene synthases, <i>ENT</i>-COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (ZmAN2) and KAURENE SYNTHASE-LIKE4 (ZmKSL4). Together, ZmAN2 and ZmKSL4 form the diterpene hydrocarbon dolabradiene. In addition, we biochemically characterized a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, ZmCYP71Z16, which catalyzes the oxygenation of dolabradiene to yield the epoxides 15,16-epoxydolabrene (epoxydolabrene) and 3β-hydroxy-15,16-epoxydolabrene (epoxydolabranol). The absence of dolabradiene and epoxydolabranol in <i>Zman2</i> mutants under elicited conditions confirmed the in vivo biosynthetic requirement of ZmAN2. Combined mass spectrometry and NMR experiments demonstrated that much of the epoxydolabranol is further converted into 3β,15,16-trihydroxydolabrene (trihydroxydolabrene). Metabolite profiling of field-grown maize root tissues indicated that dolabralexin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is widespread across common maize cultivars, with trihydroxydolabrene as the predominant diterpenoid. Oxidative stress induced dolabralexin accumulation and transcript expression of <i>ZmAN2</i> and <i>ZmKSL4</i> in root tissues, and metabolite and transcript accumulation were up-regulated in response to elicitation with the fungal pathogens <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> and <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. Consistently, epoxydolabranol significantly inhibited the growth of both pathogens in vitro at 10 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>, while trihydroxydolabrene-mediated inhibition was specific to <i>F</i>. <i>verticillioides</i>. These findings suggest that dolabralexins have defense-related roles in maize stress interactions and expand the known chemical space of diterpenoid defenses as genetic targets for understanding and ultimately improving maize resilience.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

OsmiR396d Affects Gibberellin and Brassinosteroid Signaling to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice
<p>Genetic improvement of plant architecture is one of the strategies for increasing the yield potential of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Although great progress has been made in the understanding of plant architecture regulation, the precise mechanism is still an urgent need to be revealed. Here, we report that over-expression of <i>OsMIR396d</i> in rice results in semidwarf and increased leaf angle, a typical phenotype of brassino<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steroid</span></strong> (BR) enhanced mutant. OsmiR396d is involved in the interaction network of BR and gibberellin (GA) signaling. In <i>OsMIR396d</i> over-expression plants, BR signaling was enhanced. In contrast, both the signaling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of GA were impaired. BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1, a core transcription activator of BR signaling, directly promoted the accumulation of OsmiR396d, which controlled BR response and GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by regulating the expression of different target genes respectively. <i>GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 6</i>, one of OsmiR396d targets, participated in GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and signal transduction but was not directly involved in BR signaling. This study provides a new insight into the understanding of interaction between BR and GA from multiple levels on controlling plant architecture.</p>

Stomatal VPD Response: There Is More to the Story Than ABA
<p>Guard cells shrink and close stomatal pores when air humidity decreases (i.e. when the difference between the vapor pressures of leaf and atmosphere [VPD] increases). The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in VPD-induced stomatal closure has been studied using ABA-related mutants that respond to VPD in some studies and not in others. The importance of ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in guard cells versus vasculature for whole-plant stomatal regulation is unclear as well. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines carrying mutations in different steps of ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s as well as pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <i>wilty</i> and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>flacca</i> ABA-deficient mutants had higher stomatal conductance compared with wild-type plants. To characterize the role of ABA production in different cells, we generated transgenic plants where ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s was rescued in guard cells or phloem companion cells of an ABA-deficient mutant. In both cases, the whole-plant stomatal conductance, stunted growth phenotype, and leaf ABA level were restored to wild-type values, pointing to the redundancy of ABA sources and to the effectiveness of leaf ABA transport. All ABA-deficient lines closed their stomata rapidly and extensively in response to high VPD, whereas plants with mutated protein kinase OST1 showed stunted VPD-induced responses. Another strongly ABA-insensitive mutant, defective in the six ABA PYR/RCAR receptors, responded to changes in VPD in both directions strongly and symmetrically, indicating that its VPD-induced closure could be passive hydraulic. We discuss that both the VPD-induced passive hydraulic stomatal closure and the stomatal VPD regulation of ABA-deficient mutants may be conditional on the initial pretreatment stomatal conductance.</p>

Flavan-3-ols Are an Effective Chemical Defense against Rust Infection
<p>Phenolic secondary metabolites are often thought to protect plants against attack by microbes, but their role in defense against pathogen infection in woody plants has not been investigated comprehensively. We studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, occurrence, and antifungal activity of flavan-3-ols in black poplar (<i>Populus nigra</i>), which include both monomers, such as catechin, and oligomers, known as proanthocyanidins (PAs). We identified and biochemically characterized three leucoanthocyanidin reductases and two anthocyanidin reductases from <i>P. nigra</i> involved in catalyzing the last steps of flavan-3-ol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, leading to the formation of catechin [2,3-trans-(+)-flavan-3-ol] and epicatechin [2,3-cis-(−)-flavan-3-ol], respectively. Poplar trees that were inoculated with the biotrophic rust fungus (<i>Melampsora larici-populina</i>) accumulated higher amounts of catechin and PAs than uninfected trees. The de novo-synthesized catechin and PAs in the rust-infected poplar leaves accumulated significantly at the site of fungal infection in the lower epidermis. In planta concentrations of these compounds strongly inhibited rust spore germination and reduced hyphal growth. Poplar genotypes with constitutively higher levels of catechin and PAs as well as hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) overexpressing the <i>MYB134</i> transcription factor were more resistant to rust infection. Silencing <i>PnMYB134</i>, on the other hand, decreased flavan-3-ol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and increased susceptibility to rust infection. Taken together, our data indicate that catechin and PAs are effective antifungal defenses in poplar against foliar rust infection.</p>

Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 Positively Regulates Brassinosteroid Signaling and Plant Architecture

Compared with extensive studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the mechanism of BR signaling in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is less understood. Here, we identified OsWRKY53, a transcription factor involved in defense responses, as an important regulator of rice BR signaling. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>OsWRKY53</i> overexpression led to enlarged leaf angles and increased grain size, in contrast to the erect leaves and smaller seeds in <i>oswrky53</i> mutant. In addition, the <i>oswrky53</i> exhibited decreased BR sensitivity, whereas <i>OsWRKY53</i> overexpression plants were hypersensitive to BR, suggesting that OsWRKY53 positively regulates rice BR signaling. Moreover, we show that OsWRKY53 can interact with and be phosphorylated by the OsMAPKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade, and the phosphorylation is required for the biological function of OsWRKY53 in regulating BR responses. Furthermore, we found that BR promotes OsWRKY53 protein accumulation but represses <i>OsWRKY53</i> transcript level. Taken together, this study revealed the novel role of OsWRKY53 as a regulator of rice BR signaling and also suggested a potential role of OsWRKY53 in mediating the cross talk between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e and other signaling pathways.</p>

Type B Response Regulators Act As Central Integrators in Transcriptional Control of the Auxin Biosynthesis Enzyme TAA1
<p>During embryogenesis and organ formation, establishing proper gradient is critical for auxin function, which is achieved through coordinated regulation of both auxin metabolism and transport. Expression of auxin biosynthetic genes is often tissue specific and is regulated by environmental signals. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of a key auxin biosynthetic gene, <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1 (<i>TAA1</i>). A canonical and a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) response regulator (ARR) binding site were identified in the promoter and the second intron of <i>TAA1</i>, which were required for its tissue-specific expression. C-termini of a subset of the type B ARRs selectively bind to one or both cis elements and activate the expression of <i>TAA1</i>. We further demonstrated that the ARRs not only mediate the transcriptional regulation of <i>TAA1</i> by cytokinins, but also mediate its regulation by ethylene, light, and developmental signals. Through direct protein-protein interactions, the transcriptional activity of ARR1 is enhanced by ARR12, DELLAs, and ethylene-insenstive3 (EIN3). Our study thus revealed the ARR proteins act as key node that mediate the regulation of auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al, environmental, and developmental signals through transcriptional regulation of the key auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s gene <i>TAA1</i>.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a plant’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host plant, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in leaves of AM plants differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the leaves of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM leaves. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in leaves. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in leaves of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM leaves. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in leaves are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty acid by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in vegetative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, cytological transitions, and underlying transcriptional programming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and cytological study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall thickening, and programmed cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the cytological basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic cytology of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes
<p>Seed shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls seed shattering. Knockdown mutations of <i>OSH15</i> showed reduced seed-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the <i>OSH15</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that <i>OSH15</i> messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of <i>osh15 SH5-</i>D double mutants showed that <i>SH5</i> could not increase the degree of seed shattering when <i>OSH15</i> was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the seed-shattering phenotype, <i>osh15</i> mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Knockout mutations of <i>CAD2</i>, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathway, caused an easy seed-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ. This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of seed shattering in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with <i>CAD2</i> chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s genes.</p>

Identification of a Second Site of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Biosynthesis in Comfrey to Boost Plant Defense in Floral Stage<sup>,</sup>
<p>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are toxic secondary metabolites that are found in several distantly related families of the angiosperms. The first specific step in PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is catalyzed by homospermidine synthase (HSS), which has been recruited several times independently by duplication of the gene encoding deoxyhypusine synthase, an enzyme involved in the posttranslational activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A. HSS shows highly diverse spatiotemporal gene expression in various PA-producing species. In comfrey (<i>Symphytum officinale</i>; Boraginaceae), PAs are reported to be synthesized in the roots, with HSS being localized in cells of the root endodermis. Here, we show that comfrey plants activate a second site of HSS expression when inflorescences start to develop. HSS has been localized in the bundle sheath cells of specific leaves. Tracer feeding experiments have confirmed that these young leaves express not only HSS but the whole PA biosynthetic route. This second site of PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s results in drastically increased PA levels within the inflorescences. The boost of PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is proposed to guarantee optimal protection especially of the reproductive structures.</p>

The Transcription Factor MYB29 Is a Regulator of <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i>
<p>Plants sense and integrate a variety of signals from the environment through different interacting signal transduction pathways that involve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es and signaling molecules. Using <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i> (<i>AOX1a</i>) gene expression as a model system of retrograde or stress signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN29 (MYB29) was identified as a negative regulator (<i>regulator of alternative oxidase1a 7</i> [<i>rao7</i>] mutant) in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>rao7/myb29</i> mutants have increased levels of AOX1a transcript and protein compared to wild type after induction with antimycin A. A variety of genes previously associated with the mitochondrial stress response also display enhanced transcript abundance, indicating that RAO7/MYB29 negatively regulates mitochondrial stress responses in general. Meta-analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-responsive marker genes and identification of downstream transcription factor networks revealed that MYB29 functions in the complex interplay of ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and reactive oxygen species signaling by regulating the expression of various ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR and WRKY transcription factors. Despite an enhanced induction of mitochondrial stress response genes, <i>rao7</i>/<i>myb29</i> mutants displayed an increased sensitivity to combined moderate light and drought stress. These results uncover interactions between mitochondrial retrograde signaling and the regulation of glucosinolate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, both regulated by RAO7/MYB29. This common regulator can explain why perturbation of the mitochondrial function leads to transcriptomic responses overlapping with responses to biotic stress.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, seed oil accumulation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for seed oil accumulation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing seeds during maturation. Oil and major fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in seeds was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during seed oil accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in seed oil accumulation in <i>myb89</i> seeds at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited seed oil accumulation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s during seed maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling seed oil accumulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a pathogenesis-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. Silencing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene silencing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and silencing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Class II Cytochrome P450 Reductase Governs the Biosynthesis of Alkaloids
<p>Expansion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of plant specialized metabolites notably results from the massive recruitment of cytochrome P450s that catalyze multiple types of conversion of biosynthetic intermediates. For catalysis, P450s require a two-electron transfer catalyzed by shared cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases (CPRs), making these auxiliary proteins an essential component of specialized metabolism. CPR isoforms usually group into two distinct classes with different proposed roles, namely involvement in primary and basal specialized metabolisms for class I and inducible specialized metabolism for class II. By studying the role of CPRs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of monoterpene indole alkaloids, we provide compelling evidence of an operational specialization of CPR isoforms in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (Madagascar periwinkle). Global analyses of gene expression correlation combined with transcript localization in specific leaf tissues and gene-silencing experiments of both classes of CPR all point to the strict requirement of class II CPRs for monoterpene indole alkaloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s with a minimal or null role of class I. Direct assays of interaction and reduction of P450s in vitro, however, showed that both classes of CPR performed equally well. Such high specialization of class II CPRs in planta highlights the evolutionary strategy that ensures an efficient reduction of P450s in specialized metabolism.</p>

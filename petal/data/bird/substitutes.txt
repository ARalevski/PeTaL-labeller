Correcting for Differential Transcript Coverage Reveals a Strong Relationship between Alternative Splicing and Organism Complexity
<p>What at the genomic level underlies organism complexity? Although several genomic features have been associated with organism complexity, in the case of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing, which has long been proposed to explain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in complexity, no such link has been established. Here, we analyzed over 39 million expressed sequence tags available for 47 eukaryotic species with fully sequenced genomes to obtain a comparable index of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing estimates, which corrects for the distorting effect of a variable number of transcripts per species—an important obstacle for comparative studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing has steadily increased over the last 1,400 My of eukaryotic evolution and is strongly associated with organism complexity, assayed as the number of cell types. Importantly, this association is not explained as a by-product of covariance between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing with other variables previously linked to complexity including gene content, protein length, proteome disorder, and protein interactivity. In addition, we found no evidence to suggest that the relationship of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing to cell type number is explained by drift due to reduced <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> in more complex species. Taken together, our results firmly establish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing as a significant predictor of organism complexity and are, in principle, consistent with an important role of transcript diversification through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing as a means of determining a genome’s functional information capacity.</p>

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than photosynthesis. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

Analysis of Posttranslational Activation of Alternative Oxidase Isoforms
<p>Mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative oxidase (AOX) in plants is a non-proton-motive ubiquinol oxidase that is activated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. A comparative analysis of the AOX isoenzymes AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) revealed that cysteine residues, CysI and CysII, are both involved in 2-oxo acid activation, with AOX1A activity being more increased by 2-oxo acids than that of AOX1C and AOX1D. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ion of cysteine in AOX1A by glutamate mimicked its activation by pyruvate or glyoxylate, but not in AOX1C and AOX1D. CysIII, only present in AOX1A, is not involved in activation by reduction or metabolites, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions at this position affected activity. AOX1A carrying a serine residue at position CysI was activated by succinate, while correspondingly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ed variants of AOX1C and AOX1D were insensitive. Activation by glutamate at CysI and CysII is consistent with the formation of the thiohemiacetal, while succinate activation after changing CysI to serine suggests hemiacetal formation. Surprisingly, in AOX1A, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement of CysI by alanine, which cannot form a (thio)hemiacetal, led to even higher activities, pointing to an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative mechanism of activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AOX isoforms are differentially activated and that activation at CysI and CysII is additive.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ion models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ements between amino acids of similar fitness; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion onto phenotypic trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion to phenotypic co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Genome-Wide Landscape of Alternative Splicing Events in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Recently, <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> has emerged as a model plant for studying monocot grasses and cereal crops. Using assembled expressed transcript sequences and subsequent mapping to the corresponding genome, we identified 1219 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing (AS) events spanning across 2021 putatively assembled transcripts generated from 941 genes. Approximately, 6.3% of expressed genes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>atively spliced in <i>B. distachyon</i>. We observed that a majority of the identified AS events were related to retained introns (55.5%), followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative acceptor sites (16.7%). We also observed a low percentage of exon skipping (5.0%) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative donor site events (8.8%). The ‘complex event’ that consists of a combination of two or more basic splicing events accounted for ∼14.0%. Comparative AS transcript analysis revealed 163 and 39 homologous pairs between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> and between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, respectively<i>.</i> In all, we found 16 AS transcripts to be conserved in all 3 species.

Twenty-Year Outcome After Mitral Repair Versus Replacement for Severe Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation

However, the level of evidence supporting current recommendations is low, and recent data cast doubts on its validity in the current era. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to analyze very long-term outcome after MV repair and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement for degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MIDA (Mitral Regurgitation International Database) is a multicenter registry enrolling patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet in 6 tertiary European and US centers.

After propensity score matching and inverse probability-of-treatment weighting, the 2 treatments groups were balanced, and absolute standardized differences were usually <10%, indicating adequate match. Operative mortality (defined as a death occurring within 30 days from surgery or during the same hospitalization) was lower after MV repair than after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement in both the entire population (1.3% versus 4.7%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the propensity-matched population (0.2% versus 4.4%; <i>P</i><0.001).

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in bunch number per month were mainly due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Invertible promoters mediate bacterial phase variation, antibiotic resistance, and host adaptation in the gut
<p>Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion, the reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ation between genetic states, enables infection by pathogens and colonization by commensals. However, the diversity of phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion remains underexplored. We developed the PhaseFinder algorithm to quantify DNA inversion–mediated phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. A systematic search of 54,875 bacterial genomes identified 4686 intergenic invertible DNA regions (invertons), revealing an enrichment in host-associated bacteria. Invertons containing promoters often regulate extracellular products, underscoring the importance of surface diversity for gut colonization. We found invertons containing promoters regulating antibiotic resistance genes that shift to the ON orientation after antibiotic treatment in human metagenomic data and in vitro, thereby mitigating the cost of antibiotic resistance. We observed that the orientations of some invertons diverge after fecal microbiota transplant, potentially as a result of individual-specific selective forces.</p>

Recent natural selection causes adaptive evolution of an avian polygenic trait
<p>We used extensive data from a long-term study of great tits (<i>Parus major</i>) in the United Kingdom and Netherlands to better understand how genetic signatures of selection translate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in fitness and phenotypes.

Arabidopsis <i>PIRL6</i> Is Essential for Male and Female Gametogenesis and Is Regulated by Alternative Splicing
<p>Plant intracellular Ras-group leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins (PIRLs) are related to Ras-interacting animal LRR proteins that participate in developmental cell signaling. Systematic knockout analysis has implicated some members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>PIRL</i> family in pollen development. However, for <i>PIRL6</i>, no bona fide knockout alleles have been recovered, suggesting that it may have an essential function in both male and female gametophytes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated <i>PIRL6</i> expression and induced knockdown by RNA interference. Knockdown triggered defects in gametogenesis, resulting in abnormal pollen and early developmental arrest in the embryo sac. Consistent with this, <i>PIRL6</i> was expressed in gametophytes: functional transcripts were detected in wild-type flowers but not in <i>sporocyteless</i> (<i>spl</i>) mutant flowers, which do not produce gametophytes. A genomic PIRL6-GFP fusion construct confirmed expression in both pollen and the embryo sac. Interestingly, <i>PIRL6</i> is part of a convergent overlapping gene pair, a scenario associated with an increased likelihood of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing. We detected multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative <i>PIRL6</i> mRNAs in vegetative organs and <i>spl</i> mutant flowers, tissues that lacked the functionally spliced transcript. cDNA sequencing revealed that all contained intron sequences and premature termination codons. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative mRNAs accumulated in the nonsense-mediated decay mutant <i>upf3</i>, indicating that they are normally subjected to degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that <i>PIRL6</i> is required in both male and female gametogenesis and suggest that sporophytic expression is negatively regulated by unproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing. This posttranscriptional mechanism may function to minimize PIRL6 protein expression in sporophyte tissues while allowing the overlapping adjacent gene to remain widely transcribed.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p>Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the <i>SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson Seedless’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion causing the arginine-197-to-leucine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ion in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion identified for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ion in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs.

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Two Different Transcripts of a LAMMER Kinase Gene Play Opposite Roles in Disease Resistance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing of genes can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing has demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing occurs in a large number of intron-containing genes of different species. However, despite the phenomenon having been known for decades, it is largely unknown how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>atively spliced transcripts function differently. Here, we report that two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>atively spliced transcripts of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) LAMMER kinase gene <i>OsDR11</i>, long <i>OsDR11L</i> and short <i>OsDR11S</i>, play opposite roles in rice resistance against <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Overexpressing <i>OsDR11S</i> or suppressing <i>OsDR11L</i> in rice enhanced resistance to <i>Xoo</i>, which was accompanied by an accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes. In contrast, suppressing <i>OsDR11S</i> was associated with increased susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>, along with decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes. The OsDR11S and OsDR11L proteins colocalized in the nucleus. OsDR11L showed autophosphorylation activity in vitro, while OsDR11S did not. In the presence of OsDR11S, autophosphorylation of OsDR11L was inhibited, and overexpression of <i>OsDR11S</i> suppressed <i>OsDR11L</i> expression. <i>OsDR11</i> appeared to contribute to a minor quantitative trait locus against <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsDR11L is a negative regulator in rice disease resistance, which may be associated with suppression of JA signaling. The results also suggest that OsDR11S may inhibit the function of OsDR11L at both the transcription and protein kinase activity levels, leading to resistance against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ion rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to invertebrate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

Assessing treatment outcomes using a single question
<p>Satisfaction with care is important to both patients   and to those who pay for it. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), widely   used in the service industries, has been introduced into the NHS   as the ‘friends and family test’; an overarching measure of patient   satisfaction. It assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending   the healthcare received to another, and is seen as a discriminator   of healthcare performance. We prospectively assessed 6186 individuals   undergoing primary lower limb joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement at a single university   hospital to determine the Net Promoter Score for joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ements   and to evaluate which factors contributed to the response. </p><p>Achieving pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, confidence interval   (CI) 1.83 to 2.49), the meeting of pre-operative expectation (OR   2.57, CI 2.24 to 2.97), and the hospital experience (OR 2.33, CI   2.03 to 2.68) are the domains that explain whether a patient would   recommend joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement services. These three factors, combined   with the type of surgery undertaken (OR 2.31, CI 1.68 to 3.17),   drove a predictive model that was able to explain 95% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion   in the patient’s recommendation response. Though intuitively similar,   this ‘recommendation’ metric was found to be materially different   to satisfaction responses. The difference between THR (NPS 71) and   TKR (NPS 49) suggests that no overarching score for a department   should be used without an adjustment for case mix. However, the   Net Promoter Score does measure a further important dimension to   our existing metrics: the patient experience of healthcare delivery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:622–8.</p>

Geographic Variation in Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Medicare and Veterans Affairs Populations
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it is historically underused.

After excluding patients who died in ≤30 days of hospitalization, we calculated the percentage of patients who participated in ≥1 outpatient visits for cardiac rehabilitation during the 12 months after hospitalization. We estimated adjusted and standardized rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation by state using hierarchical logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, participation in cardiac rehabilitation was 16.3% (23 403/143 756) in Medicare and 10.3% (9123/88 826) in VA. However, participation rates varied widely across states, ranging from 3.2% to 41.8% in Medicare and 1.2% to 47.6% in VA. Similar regional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion was observed in both populations. Patients in the West North Central region (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) had the highest participation, whereas those in the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) had the lowest participation in both Medicare (33.7% versus 10.6%) and VA (16.6% versus 5.1%) populations.

Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance for characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement.

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from physical or chemical damage. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical damage. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ating with a random component (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals forces upon mechanical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.</p>

Selective trade-offs maintain alleles underpinning complex trait variation in plants

Alleles that delayed flowering also increased size at reproduction, which suggests pervasive antagonistic pleiotropy in this annual plant. The “large and slow” alleles, which were less common in small, rapidly flowering populations, became more abundant in populations with greater plant size. Furthermore, natural selection within the field population favored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative alleles from year to year. Our results suggest that environmental fluctuations and selective trade-offs maintain polygenic trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within populations and also contribute to the geographic divergence in this wildflower species.</p>

Morphogen gradient reconstitution reveals Hedgehog pathway design principles
<p>In developing tissues, cells estimate their spatial position by sensing graded concentrations of diffusible signaling proteins called morphogens. Morphogen-sensing pathways exhibit diverse molecular architectures, whose roles in controlling patterning dynamics and precision have been unclear. In this work, combining cell-based in vitro gradient reconstitution, genetic rewiring, and mathematical modeling, we systematically analyzed the distinctive architectural features of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. We found that the combination of double-negative regulatory logic and negative feedback through the PTCH receptor accelerates gradient formation and improves robustness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the morphogen production rate compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative designs.

A single mutation in the prM protein of Zika virus contributes to fetal microcephaly
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) has evolved into a global health threat because of its unexpected causal link to microcephaly. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that contemporary epidemic strains have accumulated multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions from their Asian ancestor. Here we show that a single serine-to-asparagine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ion [Ser<sup>139</sup>→Asn<sup>139</sup> (S139N)] in the viral polyprotein substantially increased ZIKV infectivity in both human and mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and led to more severe microcephaly in the mouse fetus, as well as higher mortality rates in neonatal mice. Evolutionary analysis indicates that the S139N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ion arose before the 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia and has been stably maintained during subsequent spread to the Americas. This functional adaption makes ZIKV more virulent to human NPCs, thus contributing to the increased incidence of microcephaly in recent ZIKV epidemics.</p>

Zones, spots, and planetary-scale waves beating in brown dwarf atmospheres

The infrared brightness evolution is dominated by beat patterns caused by planetary-scale wave pairs and by a small number of bright spots.

Semiautomated Feature Extraction from RGB Images for Sorghum Panicle Architecture GWAS
<p>Because structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the inflorescence architecture of cereal crops can influence yield, it is of interest to identify the genes responsible for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. However, the manual collection of inflorescence phenotypes can be time consuming for the large populations needed to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and is difficult for multidimensional traits such as volume. A semiautomated phenotyping pipeline, TIM (Toolkit for Inflorescence Measurement), was developed and used to extract unidimensional and multidimensional features from images of 1,064 sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) panicles from 272 genotypes comprising a subset of the Sorghum Association Panel. GWAS detected 35 unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in inflorescence architecture. The accuracy of the TIM pipeline is supported by the fact that several of these trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (TASs) are located within chromosomal regions associated with similar traits in previously published quantitative trait locus and GWAS analyses of sorghum. Additionally, sorghum homologs of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes known to affect inflorescence architecture are enriched in the vicinities of TASs. Finally, our TASs are enriched within genomic regions that exhibit high levels of divergence between converted tropical lines and cultivars, consistent with the hypothesis that these chromosomal intervals were targets of selection during modern breeding.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>OsLG3</i> Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging
<p>Improving the performance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) under drought stress has the potential to significantly affect rice productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates drought tolerance in rice. In our previous work, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> has a positive effect on rice grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> was more strongly expressed in upland rice than in lowland rice under drought stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the promoter of <i>OsLG3</i> is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating rice seeds. Overexpression of <i>OsLG3</i> significantly improved the tolerance of rice plants to simulated drought, whereas suppression of <i>OsLG3</i> resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of <i>OsLG3</i> may improve drought tolerance in cultivated <i>japonica</i> rice.

The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the genetic and environmental conditioning of plant morphology are hindered by the lack of flexible and effective tools for quantifying morphology. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-homology-based topological methods can improve measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-homology-based methods can more comprehensively capture morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion; (2) these techniques discriminate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and detect a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e traits, whether statistically derived from uni<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e or persistent-homology-based traits, improve our ability to understand the genetic basis of phenotype; and (4) persistent-homology-based techniques detect unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of morphology are now detectable. The QTL results further imply that genetic contributions to morphology can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in tomato. Persistent homology is a versatile framework to quantify plant morphology and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

Thioredoxin-Mediated ROS Homeostasis Explains Natural Variation in Plant Regeneration
<p>Plant regeneration is fundamental to basic research and agricultural applications. The regeneration capacity of plants varies largely in different genotypes, but the reason for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion remains elusive. Here, we identified a novel thioredoxin DCC1 in determining the capacity of shoot regeneration among Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Loss of function of <i>DCC1</i> resulted in inhibited shoot regeneration. <i>DCC1</i> was expressed mainly in the inner tissues of the callus and encoded a functional thioredoxin that was localized in the mitochondria. DCC1 protein interacted directly with CARBONIC ANHYDRASE2 (CA2), which is an essential subunit of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I). DCC1 regulated Complex I activity via redox modification of CA2 protein. Mutation of <i>DCC1</i> or <i>CA2</i> led to reduced Complex I activity and triggered mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increased ROS level regulated shoot regeneration by repressing expression of the genes involved in multiple pathways. Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that DCC1 was a major determinant of the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in shoot regeneration among Arabidopsis ecotypes. Thus, our study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism by which thioredoxin-dependent redox modification regulates de novo shoot initiation via the modulation of ROS homeostasis and provides new insights into improving the capacity of plant regeneration.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative electron transport and that an excess capacity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to water deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil water content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>e analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and water management drove most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette water content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-watered conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p>Heat stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high temperature. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-temperature treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>atively spliced under high temperature. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high temperatures. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high temperature. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient temperature increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high temperature. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that heat shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in heat tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high temperature at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

A Photoreceptor Contributes to the Natural Variation of Diapause Induction in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
<p>Diapause is an adaptation that allows organisms to survive harsh environmental conditions. In species occurring over broad habitat ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause induction can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local adaptation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations adapt to their local environments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, diapause induction is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual reproduction, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual reproduction and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving habitat deterioration. We have previously shown that the induction of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of habitat deterioration and have identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in the induction of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion observed in resting stage induction. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length perception that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.</p>

Gene Tree Discordance Can Generate Patterns of Diminishing Convergence over Time
<p>Phenotypic convergence is an exciting outcome of adaptive evolution, occurring when different species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the molecular basis of convergence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which molecular evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing convergence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative cause of changes in convergence levels over time in a primate dataset. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce patterns of diminishing convergence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent convergence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">substitut</span></strong>ions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of molecular convergence in primates. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, discordance due to errors in species tree inference can drive similar patterns. Though intramolecular epistasis could in principle create a pattern of declining convergence over time, our results suggest a possible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative explanation for this widespread pattern. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene tree discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of molecular evolution.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ed more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>e more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As oxygen concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and rapid oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-oxygenation. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and oxygen consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-oxygenation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-oxygenation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to oxygen fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among palms from different geographical regions, but lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ion among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variat</span></strong>ions of important oil palm traits.</p>

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow

A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and early mortality such that other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>atives continue to be explored. Duct stenting (DS) is emerging as one such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative with potential for greater early stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital interventions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS for cardiac conditions with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred seventy-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted. Primary and secondary outcomes of survival and need for extracorporeal support were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Longer-term mortality before repair and reintervention were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. All multivariable analyses accommodated a propensity score to balance patient characteristics between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was an early (to discharge) survival advantage for infants before next-stage surgery in the DS group (odds ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.37–13.14; <i>P</i>=0.012). There was also a difference in the need for postprocedural extracorporeal support in favor of the DS group (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.058). Longer-term survival outcomes showed a reduced risk of death before repair in the DS group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.85; <i>P</i>=0.026) but a slightly increased risk of reintervention (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–2.64; <i>P</i>=0.165).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DS is emerging as a preferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">altern</span></strong>ative to a surgical shunt for neonatal palliation with evidence for greater postprocedural stability and improved patient survival to destination surgical treatment.</p></sec>

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical Evaluation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were evaluated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not different. This was also not significant when evaluating each valve type separately. Similarly, there were no differences for aortic valve area >1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> or <1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> and for Doppler velocity index >0.35 or <0.35 (all <i>P</i>=not significant).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lotus had significantly greater freedom from moderate or severe paravalvular leak and smaller valve area and higher gradients than CoreValve. The hemodynamic differences were not associated with any clinical differences in the composite end point of mortality, disabling stroke, and moderate paravalvular leak or with quality of life at 1 year of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

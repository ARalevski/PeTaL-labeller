Immigration order threatens overseas talent
<p>Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring the entry of any citizen from seven mostly Muslim nations for 90 days while procedures for more-rigorous vetting of visa applicants are put in place. The order sparked chaos at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">airport</span></strong>s in the United States and abroad, as dozens of academics and others with valid U.S. entry documents were not allowed to board U.S.-bound flights or were turned back after arriving. It provoked angst in scientists and students from the target countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen—who had secured a visa to come to the United States, and in those already living there. And it raised broader questions about whether the country can continue to benefit from the flow of scientific and engineering talent from overseas.</p>

Flight mechanics and control of escape manoeuvres in hummingbirds. I. Flight kinematics
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> A detailed examination of the body and wing kinematics of four hummingbird species in fast escape manoeuvres shows that they change wing trajectory significantly, and escape manoeuvres do not obey the ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">helicopt</span></strong>er model’.</p>

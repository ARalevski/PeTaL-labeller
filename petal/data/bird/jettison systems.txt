Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and bacteria.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Observation of parity-time symmetry breaking in a single-spin system
<p>Steering the evolution of single spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s is crucial for quantum computing and quantum sensing. The dynamics of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been theoretically investigated with parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonians exhibiting exotic properties. Although parity-time symmetry has been explored in classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, its observation in a single quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remains elusive. We developed a method to dilate a general parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonian into a Hermitian one. The quantum state evolutions ranging from regions of unbroken to broken [Formula] symmetry have been observed with a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Owing to the universality of the dilation method, our result provides a route for further exploiting and understanding the exotic properties of parity-time symmetric Hamiltonian in quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Emergence of coexisting ordered states in active matter systems
<p>Active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In particular, transitions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. These results provide a pathway by which living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Recurrences in an isolated quantum many-body system

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have been found in plants, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in plants. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we constructed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to construct the small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through designing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>.

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples.

Probing Rényi entanglement entropy via randomized measurements
<p>Entanglement is a key feature of many-body quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Measuring the entropy of different partitions of a quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> provides a way to probe its entanglement structure. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for measuring the second-order Rényi entropy based on statistical correlations between randomized measurements. Our experiments, carried out with a trapped-ion quantum simulator with partition sizes of up to 10 qubits, prove the overall coherent character of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> dynamics and reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts, in both the absence and presence of disorder.

Probing entanglement in a many-body–localized system
<p>An interacting quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>’s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body–localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Immunity as a continuum of archetypes
<p>The immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> has long been recognized for its importance in eliminating pathogens. Recently, it has become appreciated for additional distinct roles in normal tissue biology, contributing to tissue development and maintenance. Further, it is being revealed as a major force in diseases as diverse as fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cancer. The immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is exquisitely selective; more than a billion different adaptive immune lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) survey the body. These can individually be sensitized to antigens—for example, by vaccination—leading to their expansion and to a rapid and protective immune response that destroys antigen-bearing cells upon reexposure. Alternatively, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> can become “tolerant” when antigen-specific T cells and/or B cells are deleted or inactivated. Historically, activation versus inaction (tolerance) have dominated views of the immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. These, however, should be considered the extremes of a continuum of “archetypal” response states that collections of immune cells can take, many of which serve to accommodate dynamic tissue function.</p>

Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection
<p>Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly understood, risk for mucosal infection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells and alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated barrier disruption leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, intestinal epithelial–specific GLUT2 deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores barrier function and bacterial containment.

Together, our results mechanistically link hyperglycemia and intestinal barrier function with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic infectious and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.</p>

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine
<p>The chemogenetic technology DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “designer receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “designer drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>–expressed DREADDs, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Split-TALE: A TALE-Based Two-Component System for Synthetic Biology Applications in Planta
<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial Type-III effector proteins from phytopathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> species that act as transcription factors in plants. The modular DNA-binding domain of TALEs can be reprogrammed to target nearly any DNA sequence. Here, we designed and optimized a two-component AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for synthetic circuits in plants based on TALEs. In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, named split-TALE (sTALE), the TALE DNA binding domain and the transcription activation domain are separated and each fused to protein interacting domains. Physical interaction of interacting domains leads to TALE-reconstitution and can be monitored by reporter gene induction. This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a toolkit of ready-to-use vectors and single modules compatible with Golden Gate cloning and MoClo syntax.

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to generate oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>IC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic resistance induction.</p>

The GET System Inserts the Tail-Anchored Protein, SYP72, into Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome encodes homologs of the Guided Entry of Tail (GET)-anchored protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for the posttranslational insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. In yeast, TA proteins are loaded onto the cytosolic targeting factor Get3 and are then delivered to the membrane-associated Get1/2 complex for insertion into ER membranes. The role of the GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in Arabidopsis was investigated by monitoring the membrane insertion of a tail-anchored protein, SYP72, a syntaxin. SYP72 bound to yeast Get3 in vitro, forming a Get3-SYP72 fusion complex that could be inserted into yeast GET1/2-containing proteoliposomes. The Arabidopsis GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> functioned in vivo to insert TA proteins into ER membranes as demonstrated by the fact that the YFP-tagged SYP72 localized to the ER in wild-type plants but accumulated as cytoplasmic inclusions in <i>get1</i>, <i>get3</i>, or <i>get4</i> mutants. The GET mutants <i>get1</i> and <i>get3</i> were less tolerant of ER stress agents and showed symptoms of ER stress even under unstressed conditions. Hence, the GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is responsible for the insertion of TA proteins into the ER in Arabidopsis, and mutants with GET dysfunctions are more susceptible to ER stress.</p>

The Proteasome Acts as a Hub for Plant Immunity and Is Targeted by <i>Pseudomonas</i> Type III Effectors
<p>Recent evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is involved in several aspects of plant immunity and that a range of plant pathogens subvert the ubiquitin-proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to enhance their virulence. Here, we show that proteasome activity is strongly induced during basal defense in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Mutant lines of the proteasome subunits <i>RPT2a</i> and <i>RPN12a</i> support increased bacterial growth of virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> ES4326. Both proteasome subunits are required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity responses. Analysis of bacterial growth after a secondary infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves revealed that the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance (SAR) is impaired in proteasome mutants, suggesting that the proteasome also plays an important role in defense priming and SAR. In addition, we show that <i>Pst</i> inhibits proteasome activity in a type III secretion-dependent manner. A screen for type III effector proteins from <i>Pst</i> for their ability to interfere with proteasome activity revealed HopM1, HopAO1, HopA1, and HopG1 as putative proteasome inhibitors. Biochemical characterization of HopM1 by mass spectrometry indicates that HopM1 interacts with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasome subunits. This supports the hypothesis that HopM1 associates with the proteasome, leading to its inhibition. Thus, the proteasome is an essential component of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and SAR, which is targeted by multiple bacterial effectors.</p>

Our aim was to develop a scoring   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the RV.

Transcatheter Treatment of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation With the Edge-to-Edge MitraClip Technique
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current surgical and medical treatment options for severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are limited, and additional interventional approaches are required. In the present observational study, the safety and feasibility of transcatheter repair of chronic severe TR with the MitraClip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> were evaluated. In addition, the effects on clinical symptoms were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with heart failure symptoms and severe TR on optimal medical treatment were treated with the MitraClip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Safety, defined as periprocedural adverse events such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac tamponade, and feasibility, defined as successful implantation of 1 or more MitraClip devices and reduction of TR by at least 1 grade, were evaluated before discharge and after 30 days. In addition, functional outcome, defined as changes in New York Heart Assocation class and 6-minute walking distance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 64 consecutive patients (mean age 76.6±10 years) deemed unsuitable for surgery who underwent MitraClip treatment for chronic, severe TR for compassionate use. Functional TR was present in 88%; in addition, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant reductions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1±0.5 cm versus 0.6±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed.

The Ring-Type E3 Ubiquitin Ligase JUL1 Targets the VQ-Motif Protein JAV1 to Coordinate Jasmonate Signaling
<p>Jasmonates regulate plant defense and development. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1/VQ22) is a repressor of jasmonate-mediated defense responses and is degraded through the ubiquitin<i>-</i>26S proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> after herbivory. We found that JAV1-ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE1 (JUL1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with JAV1. JUL1 interacted with JAV1 in the nucleus to ubiquitinate JAV1, leading to proteasomal degradation of JAV1. The transcript levels of <i>JUL1</i> and <i>JAV1</i> were coordinately and positively regulated by the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-dependent signaling pathway in the jasmonate signaling network, but in a manner that was not dependent on CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-mediated signaling upon herbivory by <i>Spodoptera litura</i>. Gain or loss of function of JUL1 modulated the expression levels of the defensin gene <i>PDF1.2</i> in leaves, conferring on the plants various defense properties against the generalist herbivore <i>S. litura</i>. Because neither the <i>JUL1</i> mutant nor overexpression lines showed any obvious developmental defects, we concluded that the JAV1/JUL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> functions as a specific coordinator of reprogramming of plant defense responses. Altogether, our findings offer insight into the mechanisms by which the JAV1/JUL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> acts specifically to coordinate plant defense responses without interfering with plant development or growth.</p>

<i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i>: A Viral Vector for Protein Expression in Cereals
<p>Rapid and cost-effective virus-derived transient expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s for plants are invaluable in elucidating gene function and are particularly useful in plant species for which transformation-based methods are unavailable or are too time and labor demanding, such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The virus-mediated overexpression (VOX) vectors based on <i>Barley stripe mosaic virus</i> and <i>Wheat streak mosaic virus</i> described previously for these species are incapable of expressing free recombinant proteins of more than 150 to 250 amino acids, are not suited for high-throughput screens, and have other limitations. In this study, we report the development of a VOX vector based on a monopartite single-stranded positive sense RNA virus, <i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i> (genus <i>Potexvirus</i>). In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both virus-inoculated and upper uninoculated (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>. Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

The C-Domain of Oleuropein <i>β</i>-Glucosidase Assists in Protein Folding and Sequesters the Enzyme in Nucleus<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Oleuropein, a terpene-derived glycosylated secoiridoid biosynthesized exclusively by members of the Oleaceae family, is involved in a two-component defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> comprising a β-glucosidase that activates oleuropein into a toxic glutaraldehyde-like structure. Oleuropein and its deglycosylated derivatives have high pharmaceutical interest. In this study we determined that the in planta heterologous expressed OeGLU, an oleuropein-specific β-glucosidase from olive (<i>Olea europaea</i>), had enzymatic kinetics similar to the olive native enzyme. The C terminus encompassing the nuclear localization signal sequesters the enzyme in the nucleus, and predetermines the protein-protein recognition and homodimerization. Biochemical analysis revealed that OeGLU is a homomultimer with high <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>. In silico prediction modeling of the complex structure and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses revealed that the C terminus of OeGLU is essential for the proper assembly of an octameric form, a key conformational feature that determines the activity of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic characteristics of the OeGLU ensure separation from oleuropein and keep the dual-partner defensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> conditionally inactive. Upon cell destruction, the dual-partner defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is activated and olive massively releases the arsenal of defense.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-based VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic symptoms, and the PVX-based VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-based VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-based VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-based VIF represents a simple and efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

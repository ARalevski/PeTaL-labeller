A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. To maintain activity across a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structures exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being introduced in engineering. However, understanding structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>–related mechanical behaviors in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structures, including those in engineering materials, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> nanotwinned structure with highly tunable structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in pure copper. A large structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest component of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structure. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structures, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of materials through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> design.</p>

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e transcriptome becomes derepressed at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e information over the course of the night.</p>

The TRPM2 channel is a hypothalamic heat sensor that limits fever and can drive hypothermia
<p>Body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the nervous system. The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and regulates internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons. TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels in monitoring internal body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e should promote further analysis of molecular mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic circuits involved with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e homeostasis.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p>Heat stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that heat shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in heat tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. High ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in barley.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (2°C) below and above their habitat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nanograined materials is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. As grain size decreases into the nanoscale, grain coarsening occurs at much lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es, as low as ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical grain size. The instability <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rises substantially at smaller grain sizes, and the nanograins remain stable even above the recrystallization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es of coarse grains. The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

<p>Ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the phytochrome B (phyB) photoreceptor participates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e perception through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-dependent reversion from the active Pfr state to the inactive Pr state. Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e sensor in plants.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. In developing seeds, this response is largely controlled by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic control of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely controlled by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is controlled by a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

Breakup of last glacial deep stratification in the South Pacific
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stratif</span></strong>ication of the deep Southern Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum is thought to have facilitated carbon storage and subsequent release during the deglaciation as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stratif</span></strong>ication broke down, contributing to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rise. Here, we present neodymium isotope evidence from deep to abyssal waters in the South Pacific that confirms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stratif</span></strong>ication of the deepwater column during the Last Glacial Maximum. The results indicate a glacial northward expansion of Ross Sea Bottom Water and a Southern Hemisphere climate trigger for the deglacial breakup of deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stratif</span></strong>ication. It highlights the important role of abyssal waters in sustaining a deep glacial carbon reservoir and Southern Hemisphere climate change as a prerequisite for the destabilization of the water column and hence the deglacial release of sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> through upwelling.</p>

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory
<p>In common with many strongly correlated electron systems, intermediate valence compounds are believed to display a crossover from a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regime of incoherently fluctuating local moments to a low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e regime of coherent hybridized bands. We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-electron bands at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e dependence of f-electron coherence.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e dependence of these thermodynamic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply supercooled regime.

Global climatic drivers of leaf size
<p>Leaf size varies by over a 100,000-fold among species worldwide. Although 19th-century plant geographers noted that the wet tropics harbor plants with exceptionally large leaves, the latitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> of leaf size has not been well quantified nor the key climatic drivers convincingly identified. Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf size. Large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; small-leaved species typify hot, sunny environments only in arid conditions; small leaves are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e differ</span></strong>ences are key to geographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in leaf size.

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where carbon monoxide plus water yields dihydrogen and carbon dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and carbon monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations. This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low working <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Potential application in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the working <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units. We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e WGS reaction. Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas carbon monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p>Methane undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that methane molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of methane on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for methane C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert methane to value-added products.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for ablation. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in the bone during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule
<p>Morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s guide the patterning of tissues and organs during the development of multicellular organisms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for tissue growth. The consequences of this interplay between growth and patterning are not well understood. In the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides patterning and is also required for tissue growth. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> formation in a growing tissue, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> scales with the growing tissue size, tissue growth becomes spatially uniform and the tissue naturally attains a finite size. This model is consistent with many properties of the wing disc. However, we find that the MDDR is not consistent with the phenotype of scaling-defective mutants, supporting the view that temporal increase in Dpp signaling is not the driver of cell division during late phases of disc development. More generally, our results show that local coupling of cell division with morphogen signaling can lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> scaling and uniform growth even in the absence of global feedbacks. The MDDR scaling mechanism might be particularly beneficial during rapid proliferation, when global feedbacks are hard to implement.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es far above the critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Observation of the quantum spin Hall effect up to 100 kelvin in a monolayer crystal

In the short-edge limit, the monolayer exhibits the hallmark transport conductance, ~<i>e</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>h</i> per edge, where <i>e</i> is the electron charge and <i>h</i> is Planck’s constant. Moreover, a magnetic field suppresses the conductance, and the observed Zeeman-type gap indicates the existence of a Kramers degenerate point and the importance of time-reversal symmetry for protection from elastic backscattering.

Activation of surface lattice oxygen in single-atom Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> for low-temperature CO oxidation

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-oscillatory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es are usually required to observe these oscillations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum oscillation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell.

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy

Whereas direct cooling leads to the formation of documented morphologies, rapidly quenched samples that are then heated from low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e form the hexagonal C14 and cubic C15 Laves phases commonly found in metal alloys.

Here we use a network of sea-surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global mean annual SSTs were 0.5 ± 0.3°C warmer than the climatological mean from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 mean. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 mean in response to reduced mean annual insolation.</p>

Dynamic creation and evolution of gradient nanostructure in single-crystal metallic microcubes
<p>We demonstrate the dynamic creation and subsequent static evolution of extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> nanograined structures in initially near–defect-free single-crystal silver microcubes. Extreme nanostructural transformations are imposed by high strain rates, strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s, and recrystallization in high-velocity impacts of the microcubes against an impenetrable substrate. We synthesized the silver microcubes in a bottom-up seed-growth process and use an advanced laser-induced projectile impact testing apparatus to selectively launch them at supersonic velocities (~400 meters per second). Our study provides new insights into the fundamental deformation mechanisms and the effects of crystal and sample-shape symmetries resulting from high-velocity impacts. The nanostructural transformations produced in our experiments show promising pathways to developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> nanograined metals for engineering applications requiring both high strength and high toughness—for example, in structural components of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>

Cool by neuronal decision
<p>Inside the well-protected and well-ventilated human skull, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e of a few hundred thousand neurons can deviate by several degrees centigrade from that of the surrounding 100 billion or so cells. These cells constitute around 15% of the neurons in the brain's preoptic area (POA) and can change their firing rate dramatically upon a 1° to 3°C change in local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (<i>1</i>). Astoundingly, this change in activity can alter the body's core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e. Cellular and molecular details of the warm and cold sensitivity of these neurons are not well understood. Although the induction of fever has been well studied, the mechanisms that terminate fever are not yet clear. On page 1393 of this issue, Song <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report that a transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>) is key to the function of these neurons in thermoregulation, particularly in response to fever.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants integrate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

The Role of Auxin in the Pattern Formation of the Asteraceae Flower Head (Capitulum)
<p>Nature often creates complex structures by rearranging pre-existing units. One such example is the flower head (capitulum) in daisies, where a group of flowers (florets) and phyllaries (modified bracts) are arranged to superficially mimic a single flower. The capitulum is a key taxonomical innovation that defines the daisy family (Asteraceae), the largest flowering plant group. However, patterning mechanisms underlying its structure remain elusive. Here, we show that auxin, a plant hormone, provides a developmental patterning cue for the capitulum. During capitulum development, a temporal auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> occurs, regulating the successive and centripetal formation of distinct florets and phyllaries. Disruption of the endogenous auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> led to homeotic conversions of florets and phyllaries in the capitulum. Furthermore, auxin regulates floral meristem identity genes, such as <i>Matricaria inodora RAY2</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>inodora LEAFY</i>, which determine floret and phyllary identity. This study reveals the mechanism of capitulum patterning and highlights how common developmental tools, such as hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s, have independently evolved in plants and animals.</p>

A Temperature-Sensitive Misfolded bri1-301 Receptor Requires Its Kinase Activity to Promote Growth
<p>BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) is a leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase that functions as the cell surface receptor for brassinosteroids (BRs). Previous studies showed that BRI1 requires its kinase activity to transduce the extracellular BR signal into the nucleus. Among the many reported mutant <i>bri1</i> alleles, <i>bri1-301</i> is unique, as its glycine-989-to-isoleucine mutation completely inhibits its kinase activity in vitro but only gives rise to a weak dwarf phenotype compared with strong or null <i>bri1</i> alleles, raising the question of whether kinase activity is essential for the biological function of BRI1. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) bri1-301 mutant receptor exhibits weak BR-triggered phosphorylation in vivo and absolutely requires its kinase activity for the limited growth that occurs in the <i>bri1-301</i> mutant. We also show that bri1-301 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-sensitive misfolded protein that is rapidly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane by yet unknown mechanisms. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e increase from 22°C to 29°C reduced the protein stability and biochemical activity of bri1-301, likely due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e-enhanced protein misfolding. The bri1-301 protein could be used as a model to study the degradation machinery for misfolded membrane proteins with cytosolic structural lesions and the plasma membrane-associated protein quality-control mechanism.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Arabidopsis Ecotypes Reveals a Role for Brassinosteroids in Root Hydrotropism
<p>Plant roots respond to soil moisture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s and remodel their growth orientation toward water through hydrotropism, a process vital for acclimation to a changing soil environment. Mechanisms underlying the root hydrotropic response, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined hydrotropism in 31 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotypes collected from different parts of the world and grown along moisture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in a specially designed soil-simulation system. Comparative transcriptome profiling and physiological analyses were carried out on three selected ecotypes, Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col-0) (strongly hydrotropic), Col-0 (moderately hydrotropic), and C24 (weakly hydrotropic), and in mutant lines with altered root hydrotropic responses. We show that H<sup>+</sup> efflux, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, and phytohormone signaling may contribute to root hydrotropism. Among phytohormones, the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) was examined further. In the presence of an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis, the strong hydrotropic response observed in Ws was reduced. The root H<sup>+</sup> efflux and primary root elongation also were inhibited when compared with C24, an ecotype that showed a weak hydrotropic response. The BR-insensitive mutant <i>bri1-5</i> displayed higher rates of root growth inhibition and root curvature on moisture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in vertical or oblique orientation when compared with wild-type Ws. We also demonstrate that BRI1 (a BR receptor) interacts with AHA2 (a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) and that their expression patterns are highly coordinated. This synergistic action may contribute to the strong hydrotropism observed in Ws. Our results suggest that BR-associated H<sup>+</sup> efflux is critical in the hydrotropic response of Arabidopsis roots.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses six <i>LAZY</i> genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in roots and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to root and shoot branch angles and gravitropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary roots. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the gravitropism mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral root branch angle. Lateral roots of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary root axis, and they were agravitropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially agravitropic, but their phototropic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the root of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also agravitropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed gravitropic response. A reversed auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> across the root visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>es. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">temperatur</span></strong>e rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

Long-Term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Who Have Had Infants With Heart Defects
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The possibility that congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s signal a familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease has not been investigated. We aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular disorders later in life was higher for women who have had newborns with congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a cohort of 1 084 251 women who had delivered infants between 1989 and 2013 in Quebec, Canada. We identified women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, and tracked the women over time for future hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization per 1000 person-years, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between infant heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and risk of maternal cardiovascular hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, parity, preeclampsia, comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Women whose infants had heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a higher overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization. There were 3.38 cardiovascular hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for those with critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncritical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), and 2.42 for no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.39–2.44). In comparison with no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, women whose infants had critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a hazard ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13–1.82) for any cardiovascular hospitalization, and women whose infants had noncritical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a hazard ratio of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34), in adjusted models. Risks of specific causes of cardiovascular hospitalization, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other atherosclerotic disorders, were also greater for mothers of infants with congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s than with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Women whose infants have congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s have a greater risk of cardiovascular hospitalization later in life.

Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying fetuses with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter.

Obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates bacterial surface sensing
<p>It is critical for bacteria to recognize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact and initiate physiological changes required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-associated lifestyles. Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in sensing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and facilitating downstream behaviors, but the mechanism by which pili mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing has been unclear. We visualized <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> pili undergoing dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact, these cycles ceased, which coincided with synthesis of the adhesive holdfast required for attachment. Physically blocking pili imposed resistance to pilus retraction, which was sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact. Thus, to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, bacteria use the resistance on retracting, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-bound pili that occurs upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e contact.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-active molecules that can lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as well as insoluble lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants. Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants showed strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e activity that reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>tants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Exercise Intolerance in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common syndrome with a pressing shortage of therapies. Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of HFpEF, yet its pathophysiology remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the mechanism of exercise intolerance in 134 patients referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing: 79 with HFpEF and 55 controls. We performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive monitoring to measure hemodynamics, blood gases, and gas exchange during exercise. We used these measurements to quantify 6 steps of oxygen transport and utilization (the O<sub>2</sub> pathway) in each patient with HFpEF, identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive steps that impair each one’s exercise capacity (peak Vo<sub>2</sub>). We then quantified the functional significance of each O<sub>2</sub> pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> by calculating the improvement in exercise capacity a patient could expect from correcting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Peak Vo<sub>2</sub> was reduced by 34±2% (mean±SEM, <i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF compared with controls of similar age, sex, and body mass index. The vast majority (97%) of patients with HFpEF harbored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s at multiple steps of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway, the identity and magnitude of which varied widely. Two of these steps, cardiac output and skeletal muscle O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, were impaired relative to controls by an average of 27±3% and 36±2%, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001 for both). Due to interactions between a given patient’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, the predicted benefit of correcting any single one was often minor; on average, correcting a patient’s cardiac output led to a 7±0.5% predicted improvement in exercise intolerance, whereas correcting a patient’s muscle diffusion capacity led to a 27±1% improvement. At the individual level, the impact of any given O<sub>2</sub> pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> on a patient’s exercise capacity was strongly influenced by comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Systematic analysis of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway in HFpEF showed that exercise capacity was undermined by multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, including reductions in cardiac output and skeletal muscle diffusion capacity. An important source of disease heterogeneity stemmed from variation in each patient’s personal profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. Personalized O<sub>2</sub> pathway analysis could identify patients most likely to benefit from treating a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>; however, the system properties of O<sub>2</sub> transport favor treating multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s at once, as with exercise training.</p></sec>

Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal fever–associated birth defects
<p>Birth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. Neural crest cells are precursor populations essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced birth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, we engineered iron-binding modifications to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activation of these channels in specific cellular locations and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulation of radio frequency–controlled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated fever-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a previously undescribed mechanism for congenital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, whereby hyperthermia activates ion channels that negatively affect fetal development.</p>

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e abundance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was abundant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc abundance at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst geometries. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms lead to tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet thickness. Atomic-level control of thickness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

Global extent of rivers and streams
<p>The turbulent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es of rivers and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere.

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a material’s catalytic properties requires identifying structural features that give rise to active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction.

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor
<p>When bacteria encounter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es, they respond with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e colonization and virulence induction. The mechanisms of bacterial mechanosensation and downstream signaling remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a tactile sensing cascade in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> in which the flagellar motor acts as sensor. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e-induced motor interference stimulated the production of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate by the motor-associated diguanylate cyclase DgcB. This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a polysaccharide adhesin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli. Thus, the bacterial flagellar motor acts as a tetherless sensor reminiscent of mechanosensitive channels.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level.

Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e planes of feldspar.

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the accumulation of plastid ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of plastid encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> of the plastid 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of plastid proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> plastids, suggesting that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in plastid translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in ribosome assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between plastid protein import, the processing of plastid rRNAs, and the assembly of plastid ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

The secreted <i>AdamTS-A</i> metalloprotease is required for collective cell migration
<p>Members of the ADAMTS family of secreted metalloproteases play crucial roles in modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) in development and disease. Here, we show that ADAMTS-A, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of human ADAMTS 9 and ADAMTS 20, and of <i>C. elegans</i> GON-1, is required for cell migration during embryogenesis. <i>AdamTS-A</i> is expressed in multiple migratory cell types, including hemocytes, caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM), the visceral branch of the trachea (VBs) and the secretory portion of the salivary gland (SG). Loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in germ cell, CVM and VB migration and, depending on the tissue, <i>AdamTS-A</i> functions both autonomously and non-autonomously. In the highly polarized collective of the SG epithelium, loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e irregularities and cell elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. We provide evidence that ADAMTS-A is secreted into the SG lumen where it functions to release cells from the apical ECM, consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s observed in <i>AdamTS-A</i> mutant SGs. We show that loss of the apically localized protocadherin <i>Cad99C</i> rescues the SG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, suggesting that Cad99C serves as a link between the SG apical membrane and the secreted apical ECM component(s) cleaved by ADAMTS-A. Our analysis of <i>AdamTS-A</i> function in the SG suggests a novel role for ADAMTS proteins in detaching cells from the apical ECM, facilitating tube elongation during collective cell migration.</p>

Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral endocytosis before ADAM10 processing
<p>The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by cell-cell contact, is a major regulator of cell fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e as a heterodimer of the Notch extracellular domain associated with the transmembrane and intracellular domains. After ligand binding, Notch undergoes proteolysis, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that regulates gene expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of Notch1-expressing cells. We found that, upon ligand binding, Notch1 at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e was ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the internalization of the Notch1 extracellular domain by the ligand-expressing cell and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by the Notch1-expressing cell, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10 generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the NICD, which has been thought to occur at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. However, we found that blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intracellular compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

Electrical suppression of all nonradiative recombination pathways in monolayer semiconductors
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device applications as the stringent requirement of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> density is eased.</p>

Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces
<p>The rational synthesis of nanographenes and carbon nanoribbons directly on nonmetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es has been an elusive goal for a long time. We report that activation of the carbon (C)–fluorine (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling directly on metal oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes directly on the rutile titania <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es.</p>

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e elemental composition of dwarf planet Ceres constrains its regolith ice content, aqueous alteration processes, and interior evolution. Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e materials were processed by the action of water within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres’ carbon-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of hydrogen to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest ice-rock fractionation, resulting in differences between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e and bulk composition. At mid-to-high latitudes, the regolith contains high concentrations of hydrogen, consistent with broad expanses of water ice, confirming theoretical predictions that ice can survive for billions of years just beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Role of Glycosyltransferases in Pollen Wall Primexine Formation and Exine Patterning
<p>The pollen cell wall is important for protection of male sperm from physical stresses and consists of an inner gametophyte-derived intine layer and a sporophyte-derived exine layer. The polymeric constituents of the robust exine are termed sporopollenin. The mechanisms by which sporopollenin is anchored onto microspores and polymerized in specific patterns are unknown, but the primexine, a transient cell wall matrix formed on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of microspores at the late tetrad stage, is hypothesized to play a key role. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>spongy</i> (<i>spg</i>) and <i>uneven pattern of exine</i> (<i>upex</i>) mutants exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive and irregular exine patterns. <i>SPG2</i> (synonymous with <i>IRREGULAR XYLEM9-LIKE</i> [<i>IRX9L</i>]) encodes a family GT43 glycosyltransferase involved in xylan backbone biosynthesis, while <i>UPEX1</i> encodes a family GT31 glycosyltransferase likely involved in galactosylation of arabinogalactan proteins. Imaging of developing <i>irx9l</i> microspores showed that the earliest detectable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> was in primexine formation. Furthermore, wild-type microspores contained primexine-localized epitopes indicative of the presence of xylan, but these were absent in <i>irx9l</i>. These data, together with the <i>spg</i> phenotype of a mutant in <i>IRX14L</i>, which also plays a role in xylan backbone elongation, indicate the presence of xylan in pollen wall primexine, which plays a role in exine patterning on the microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. We observed an aberrant primexine and irregular patterns of incipient sporopollenin deposition in <i>upex1</i>, suggesting that primexine-localized arabinogalactan proteins could play roles in sporopollenin adhesion and patterning early in microspore wall development. Our data provide new insights into the biochemical and functional properties of the primexine component of the microspore cell wall.</p>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of impaction   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. Impaction bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. The precepts of modern, revision impaction grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously impacted morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic cement is used to stabilise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the revised   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique.

Mechanisms of <i>prickle1a</i> function in zebrafish epilepsy and retinal neurogenesis
<p>Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures. The etiology is heterogeneous with both genetic and environmental causes. Genes that regulate neurotransmitters and ion channels in the central nervous system have been associated with epilepsy. However, a recent screening in human epilepsy patients identified mutations in the <i>PRICKLE1</i> (<i>PK1</i>) locus, highlighting a potentially novel mechanism underlying seizures. PK1 is a core component of the planar cell polarity network that regulates tissue polarity. Zebrafish studies have shown that Pk1 coordinates cell movement, neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth during embryonic development. Yet how dysfunction of Pk1 relates to epilepsy is unknown. To address the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis, we used zebrafish to characterize Pk1a function and epilepsy-related mutant forms. We show that knockdown of <i>pk1a</i> activity sensitizes zebrafish larva to a convulsant drug. To model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in the central nervous system, we used the retina and found that <i>pk1a</i> knockdown induces neurite outgrowth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s; yet visual function is maintained. Furthermore, we characterized the functional and biochemical properties of the PK1 mutant forms identified in human patients. Functional analyses demonstrate that the wild-type Pk1a partially suppresses the gene knockdown retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s but not the mutant forms. Biochemical analysis reveals increased ubiquitylation of one mutant form and decreased translational efficiency of another mutant form compared with the wild-type Pk1a. Taken together, our results indicate that mutation of human PK1 could lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in neurodevelopment and signal processing, providing insight into seizure predisposition in these patients.</p>

<i>chaoptin</i>, <i>prominin</i>, <i>eyes shut</i> and <i>crumbs</i> form a genetic network controlling the apical compartment of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells
<p>The apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of epithelial cells is often highly specialised to fulfil cell type-specific functions. Many epithelial cells expand their apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e by forming microvilli, actin-based, finger-like membrane protrusions. The apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells (PRCs) forms tightly packed microvilli, which are organised into the photosensitive rhabdomeres. As previously shown, the GPI-anchored adhesion protein Chaoptin is required for the stability of the microvilli, whereas the transmembrane protein Crumbs is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis. Here we show that <i>chaoptin</i> synergises with <i>crumbs</i> to ensure optimal rhabdomere width. In addition, reduction of <i>crumbs</i> ameliorates morphogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s observed in PRCs mutant for <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i>, known antagonists of <i>chaoptin</i>. These results suggest that these four genes provide a balance of adhesion and anti-adhesion to maintain microvilli development and maintenance. Similar to <i>crumbs</i> mutant PRCs, PRCs devoid of <i>prominin</i> or <i>eyes shut</i> undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration. Given the observation that human orthologues of <i>crumbs</i>, <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i> result in progressive retinal degeneration and blindness, the <i>Drosophila</i> eye is ideally suited to unravel the genetic and cellular mechanisms that ensure morphogenesis of PRCs and their maintenance under light-mediated stress.</p>

Observation of topological superconductivity on the surface of an iron-based superconductor
<p>Topological superconductors are predicted to host exotic Majorana states that obey non-Abelian statistics and can be used to implement a topological quantum computer. Most of the proposed topological superconductors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures. By using high-resolution spin-resolved and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we find that the iron-based superconductor FeTe<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Se<i><sub>x</sub></i> (<i>x</i> = 0.45; superconducting transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 14.5 kelvin) hosts Dirac-cone–type spin-helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e states at the Fermi level; the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e states exhibit an s-wave superconducting gap below <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>.

Self-heating–induced healing of lithium dendrites
<p>Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and stripping invariably leads to growth of dendrites that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery. It is generally accepted that the dendrite problem is exacerbated at high current densities. Here, we report a regime for dendrite evolution in which the reverse is true. In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping current density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e migration of Li. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e diffusion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e.

Polarity compensation mechanisms on the perovskite surface KTaO<sub>3</sub>(001)
<p>The stacking of alternating charged planes in ionic crystals creates a diverging electrostatic energy—a “polar catastrophe”—that must be compensated at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. We used scanning probe microscopies and density functional theory to study compensation mechanisms at the perovskite potassium tantalate<i> </i>(KTaO<sub>3</sub>) (001) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e as increasing degrees of freedom were enabled. The as-cleaved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e in vacuum is frozen in place but immediately responds with an insulator-to-metal transition and possibly ferroelectric lattice distortions. Annealing in vacuum allows the formation of isolated oxygen vacancies, followed by a complete rearrangement of the top layers into an ordered pattern of KO and TaO<sub>2</sub> stripes. The optimal solution is found after exposure to water vapor through the formation of a hydroxylated overlayer with ideal geometry and charge.</p>

The epigenetic control of stemness in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell fate commitment
<p>After priming, naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes establish specific heritable transcription programs that define progression to long-lasting memory cells or to short-lived effector cells. Although lineage specification is critical for protection, it remains unclear how chromatin dynamics contributes to the control of gene expression programs. We explored the role of gene silencing by the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. In murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated after <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection, Suv39h1-dependent trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 controls the expression of a set of stem cell–related memory genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in silencing of stem/memory genes selectively in <i>Suv39h1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive T cell effectors. As a result, <i>Suv39h1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show sustained survival and increased long-term memory reprogramming capacity. Thus, Suv39h1 plays a critical role in marking chromatin to silence stem/memory genes during CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector terminal differentiation.</p>

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with acoustic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

Multicluster Pcdh diversity is required for mouse olfactory neural circuit assembly

Although deletion of individual <i>Pcdh</i> clusters had subtle phenotypic consequences, the loss of all three clusters (tricluster deletion) led to a severe axonal arborization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> and loss of self-avoidance. By contrast, when endogenous Pcdh diversity is overridden by the expression of a single–tricluster gene repertoire (α and β and γ), OSN axons fail to converge to form glomeruli, likely owing to contact-mediated repulsion between axons expressing identical combinations of Pcdh isoforms.</p>

We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> ice–rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO<sub>2</sub> ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO<sub>2</sub> ice and the depth of the eroded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e layer. We interpret the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the comet.</p>

Ultrafine jagged platinum nanowires enable ultrahigh mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction
<p>Improving the platinum (Pt) mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) requires optimization of both the specific activity and the electrochemically active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e area (ECSA). We found that solution-synthesized Pt/NiO core/shell nanowires can be converted into PtNi alloy nanowires through a thermal annealing process and then transformed into jagged Pt nanowires via electrochemical dealloying. The jagged nanowires exhibit an ECSA of 118 square meters per gram of Pt and a specific activity of 11.5 milliamperes per square centimeter for ORR (at 0.9 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode), yielding a mass activity of 13.6 amperes per milligram of Pt, nearly double previously reported best values. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations suggest that highly stressed, undercoordinated rhombus-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e configurations of the jagged nanowires enhance ORR activity versus more relaxed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es.</p>

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators
<p>Topological crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline symmetry leads to topologically protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e states with a chiral spin texture, rendering them potential candidates for spintronics applications. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of one-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e step edges of the three-dimensional topological crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent stability and protects them from backscattering. We experimentally show that this stability results in a striking robustness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, strong magnetic fields, and elevated temperature.</p>

A Functional Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Normal Vegetative Development
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in plants in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and plays an important role in mitigating stress damage. Multiple factors act in the UPR, including the membrane-associated transcription factor, BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 17 (bZIP17), and the membrane-associated RNA splicing factor, INOSITOL REQUIRING ENZYME1 (IRE1). We have analyzed an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ire1a ire1b bzip17</i> triple mutant, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in stress signaling, and found that the mutant is also impaired in vegetative plant growth under conditions without externally applied stress. This raised the possibility that the UPR functions in plant development in the same manner as it does in responding to stress. bZIP17 is mobilized to the nucleus in response to stress, and through the analysis of a mobilization-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive bZIP17 mutant, we found that to support normal plant development bZIP17 must be capable of mobilization. Likewise, through the analysis of <i>ire1</i> mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in either protein kinase or RNase activities, we found that both must be operative to promote normal development. These findings demonstrate that the UPR, which is associated with stress responses in plants, also functions under unstressed conditions to support normal development.</p>

A Multilevel Study of Melon Fruit Reticulation Provides Insight into Skin Ligno-Suberization Hallmarks
<p>The skin of fleshy fruit is typically covered by a thick cuticle. Some fruit species develop different forms of layers directly above their skin. Reticulation, for example, is a specialized suberin-based coating that ornaments some commercially important melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) fruit and is an important quality trait. Despite its importance, the structural, molecular, and biochemical features associated with reticulation are not fully understood. Here, we performed a multilevel investigation of structural attributes, chemical composition, and gene expression profiles on a set of reticulated and smooth skin melons. High-resolution microscopy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e profiling, and histochemical staining assays show that reticulation comprises cells with heavily suberized walls accumulating large amounts of typical suberin monomers, as well as lignified cells localized underneath the specialized suberized cell layer. Reticulated skin was characterized by induced expression of biosynthetic genes acting in the core phenylpropanoid, suberin, lignin, and lignan pathways. Transcripts of genes associated with lipid polymer assembly, cell wall organization, and loosening were highly enriched in reticulated skin tissue. These signatures were exclusive to reticulated structures and absent in both the smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es observed in between reticulated regions and in the skin of smooth fruit. Our data provide important insights into the molecular and metabolic bases of reticulation and its tight association with skin ligno-suberization during melon fruit development. Moreover, these insights are likely to contribute to melon breeding programs aimed at improving postharvest qualities associated with fleshy fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e layers.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule arrays form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical array patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule array patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the timing of transitions between array patterns but no substantive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the array patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule array architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between array patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate array transitions.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p>Pollen viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during pollen development involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing pollen. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive pollen development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in pollen germination and tube growth. Our results provide insights into the function of VAC14 and, by inference, that of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plant cells.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Involvement of Adapter Protein Complex 4 in Hypersensitive Cell Death Induced by Avirulent Bacteria<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant immunity to avirulent bacterial pathogens is associated with subcellular membrane dynamics including fusion between the vacuolar and plasma membranes, resulting in hypersensitive cell death. Here, we report that ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX-4 (AP-4) subunits are involved in plant immunity associated with hypersensitive cell death. We isolated a mutant with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in resistance to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pto</i>) DC3000 <i>avrRpm1</i> from a vacuolar protein sorting mutant library of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutant was identical to <i>gfs4-1</i>, which has a mutation in the gene encoding the AP-4 subunit AP4B. Thus, we focused on AP4B and another subunit, AP4E. All of the mutants (<i>ap4b-3</i>, <i>ap4b-4</i>, <i>ap4e-1</i>, and <i>ap4e-2</i>) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in hypersensitive cell death and resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2, both of which are recognized on the plasma membrane, while they showed slightly enhanced susceptibility to the type-III-secretion-deficient <i>P. syringae</i> strain <i>hrcC</i>. On the other hand, both <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> showed no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRps4, which is recognized in the cytosol and does not induce hypersensitive cell death. Upon infection with <i>Pto</i> DC3000 <i>avrRpt2</i>, the <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> leaf cells did not show fusion between vacuolar and plasma membranes, whereas the wild-type leaf cells did. These results suggest that AP-4 contributes to cell death-associated immunity, possibly via membrane fusion, after type III effector-recognition on the plasma membrane.</p>

Flavodiiron Protein Substitutes for Cyclic Electron Flow without Competing CO<sub>2</sub> Assimilation in Rice
<p>Flavodiiron protein (FLV) mediates photoreduction of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O. It is conserved from cyanobacteria to gymnosperms but not in angiosperms. The introduction of a moss (<i>Physcomitrella patens</i>) <i>FLV</i> (<i>PpFLV</i>) gene into Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) made photosystem I (PSI) resistant to fluctuating light. Here, we used the same strategy with three rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genotypes. PpFLV in the wild-type rice background functioned as an efficient PSI electron sink and increased resistance to PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. The introduction of PpFLV into the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi mutant [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5)-dependent cyclic electron transport around PSI, CET-PSI], the <i>crr6</i> mutant [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in chloroplast NAD(P)H-dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH)-dependent CET-PSI], and the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi <i>crr6</i> double mutant (double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in CET-PSI activity) alleviated PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. Furthermore, PpFLV substituted for the function of PGR5- and NDH-dependent CET-PSI without competing for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation under constant light, as there was no difference in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation per Rubisco content and biomass production was recovered to the wild-type level. Thus, the exogenous FLV system could act not only as a safety valve under fluctuating light, but also generate a proton motive force for balancing the ATP/NADPH production ratio during steady-state photosynthesis.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>e of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfac</span></strong>es. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

The PEX1 ATPase Stabilizes PEX6 and Plays Essential Roles in Peroxisome Biology
<p>A variety of metabolic pathways are sequestered in peroxisomes, conserved organelles that are essential for human and plant survival. Peroxin (PEX) proteins generate and maintain peroxisomes. The PEX1 ATPase facilitates recycling of the peroxisome matrix protein receptor PEX5 and is the most commonly affected peroxin in human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of, to our knowledge, the first Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex1</i> missense alleles: <i>pex1-2</i> and <i>pex1-3</i>. <i>pex1-2</i> displayed peroxisome-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s accompanied by reduced PEX1 and PEX6 levels. These <i>pex1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s were exacerbated by growth at high temperature and ameliorated by growth at low temperature or by <i>PEX6</i> overexpression, suggesting that PEX1 enhances PEX6 stability and vice versa. <i>pex1-3</i> conferred embryo lethality when homozygous, confirming that PEX1, like several other Arabidopsis peroxins, is essential for embryogenesis. <i>pex1-3</i> displayed symptoms of peroxisome dysfunction when heterozygous; this semidominance is consistent with PEX1 forming a heterooligomer with PEX6 that is poisoned by pex1-3 subunits. Blocking autophagy partially rescued <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, including the restoration of normal peroxisome size, suggesting that increasing peroxisome abundance can compensate for the deficiencies caused by <i>pex1-3</i> and that the enlarged peroxisomes visible in <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> may represent autophagy intermediates. Overexpressing <i>PEX1</i> in wild-type plants impaired growth, suggesting that excessive PEX1 can be detrimental. Our genetic, molecular, and physiological data support the heterohexamer model of PEX1-PEX6 function in plants.</p>

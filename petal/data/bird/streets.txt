Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, 19% for open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing of spin-polarized electrons across a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron spin transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this magneto-Seebeck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing by placing a magnetic probe tip in close proximity to a magnetic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the spin texture of the sample lead to spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a spin detector for spintronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using magneto-Seebeck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing to convert spin information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferromagnetic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Real-space imaging of molecular structure and chemical bonding by single-molecule inelastic tunneling probe
<p>The arrangement of atoms and bonds in a molecule influences its physical and chemical properties. The scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscope can provide electronic and vibrational signatures of single molecules. However, these signatures do not relate simply to the molecular structure and bonding. We constructed an inelastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing probe based on the scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscope to sense the local potential energy landscape of an adsorbed molecule with a carbon monoxide (CO)–terminated tip. The skeletal structure and bonding of the molecule are revealed from imaging the spatial variations of a CO vibration as the CO-terminated tip probes the core of the interactions between adjacent atoms. An application of the inelastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing probe reveals the sharing of hydrogen atoms among multiple centers in intramolecular and extramolecular bonding.</p>

Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor
<p>The search for Majorana bound states (MBSs) has been fueled by the prospect of using their non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. Two-dimensional superconducting topological materials have been predicted to host MBSs as zero-energy modes in vortex cores. By using scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing spectroscopy on the superconducting Dirac surface state of the iron-based superconductor FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub>, we observed a sharp zero-bias peak inside a vortex core that does not split when moving away from the vortex center. The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing barrier is consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.</p>

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intersect</span></strong>ions play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image wave-packet trajectories through these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intersect</span></strong>ions directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-photon and two-photon excitation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-photon channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear wave packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intersect</span></strong>ion. In the one-photon channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions. These findings benchmark and validate ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics calculations.</p>

Autonomous vehicles: No driver…no regulation?
<p>According to the latest statistics from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 37,461 people were killed on the nation's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s in 2016 (<i>1</i>). Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to reduce this number substantially. However, proper safeguards must be established immediately by federal regulators to govern the testing and deployment of AVs and ensure public safety. We must not undermine current safety standards for the sake of AV development. Moreover, reconsidering current requirements may be necessary to take advantage of this revolution. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents in a recent CARAVAN public opinion poll expressed concern about sharing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong> with driverless cars (<i>2</i>). If commonsense protections are not in place to govern AV development, and problems occur, the public will reject AVs, and the opportunity this new technology presents to improve public safety will be lost.</p>

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear optics, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer superconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear optical response. A giant terahertz third harmonic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin. We model these results by hypothesizing the presence of a pair density wave condensate, in which nonlinear mixing of optically silent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing modes drives large dipole-carrying supercurrents.</p>

Structure of the complete elongation complex of RNA polymerase II with basal factors
<p>In the early stage of transcription, eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) exchanges initiation factors with elongation factors to form an elongation complex for processive transcription. Here we report the structure of the Pol II elongation complex bound with the basal elongation factors Spt4/5, Elf1, and TFIIS. Spt4/5 (the Spt4/Spt5 complex) and Elf1 modify a wide area of the Pol II surface. Elf1 bridges the Pol II central cleft, completing a “DNA entry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>” for downstream DNA. Spt4 and the Spt5 NGN and KOW1 domains encircle the upstream DNA, constituting a “DNA exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>.” The Spt5 KOW4 and KOW5 domains augment the “RNA exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>,” directing the exiting nascent RNA. Thus, the elongation complex establishes a completely different transcription and regulation platform from that of the initiation complexes.</p>

Observation of the geometric phase effect in the H + HD → H<sub>2</sub> + D reaction
<p>Theory has established the importance of geometric phase (GP) effects in the adiabatic dynamics of molecular systems with a conical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intersect</span></strong>ion connecting the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces, but direct observation of their manifestation in chemical reactions remains a major challenge.

Velocity map ion imaging revealed fast angular oscillations in product quantum state–resolved differential cross sections in the forward scattering direction for H<sub>2</sub> products at specific rovibrational levels. The experimental results agree with adiabatic quantum dynamical calculations only when the GP effect is included.</p>

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">highway</span></strong> by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">highway</span></strong> has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient waves and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p>Magnetic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises varied magnetic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and ferromagnets, but device-oriented characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing through the layered magnetic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. We electrically detect the magnetic ground state and interlayer coupling and observe a field-induced metamagnetic transition. The metamagnetic transition results in magnetoresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective magnetic excitations (magnons) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

CAT-tailing as a fail-safe mechanism for efficient degradation of stalled nascent polypeptides
<p>Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal degradation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain degradation in budding yeast. We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately proximal to the ribosome exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible lysines, CAT-tailing enabled degradation by exposing lysines sequestered in the ribosome exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-degradable substrates.</p>

Citywide effects of high-occupancy vehicle restrictions: Evidence from “three-in-one” in Jakarta
<p>Widespread use of single-occupancy cars often leads to traffic congestion. Using anonymized traffic speed data from Android phones collected through Google Maps, we investigated whether high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) policies can combat congestion. We studied Jakarta’s “three-in-one” policy, which required all private cars on two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s to carry at least three passengers during peak hours. After the policy was abruptly abandoned in April 2016, delays rose from 2.1 to 3.1 minutes per kilometer (min/km) in the morning peak and from 2.8 to 5.3 min/km in the evening peak. The lifting of the policy led to worse traffic throughout the city, even on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s that had never been restricted or at times when restrictions had never been in place. In short, we find that HOV policies can greatly improve traffic conditions.</p>

Bifurcating electron-transfer pathways in DNA photolyases determine the repair quantum yield
<p>Photolyase is a blue-light–activated enzyme that repairs ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that occurs in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. Previous studies on microbial photolyases have revealed an electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing pathway that is critical for the repair mechanism. In this study, we used femtosecond spectroscopy to deconvolute seven electron-transfer reactions in 10 elementary steps in all classes of CPD photolyases. We report a unified electron-transfer pathway through a conserved structural configuration that bifurcates to favor direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing in prokaryotes and a two-step hopping mechanism in eukaryotes. Both bifurcation routes are operative, but their relative contributions, dictated by the reduction potentials of the flavin cofactor and the substrate, determine the overall quantum yield of repair.</p>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become positioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear positioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear positioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the positioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear positioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant positioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear positioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear positioning in leaf cells.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The dynamic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the dynamic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT dynamics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT dynamics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

Electrofluorochromism at the single-molecule level
<p>The interplay between the oxidation state and the optical properties of molecules is important for applications in displays, sensors, and molecular-based memories. The fundamental mechanisms occurring at the level of a single molecule have been difficult to probe. We used a scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscope (STM) to characterize and control the fluorescence of a single zinc-phthalocyanine radical cation adsorbed on a sodium chloride–covered gold (111) sample. The neutral and oxidized states of the molecule were identified on the basis of their fluorescence spectra, which revealed very different emission energies and vibronic fingerprints. The emission of the charged molecule was controlled by tuning the thickness of the insulator and the plasmons localized at the apex of the STM tip. In addition, subnanometric variations of the tip position were used to investigate the charging and electroluminescence mechanisms.</p>

Real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction of a single molecule
<p>Plasmon-induced chemical reactions of molecules adsorbed on metal nanostructures are attracting increased attention for photocatalytic reactions. However, the mechanism remains controversial because of the difficulty of direct observation of the chemical reactions in the plasmonic field, which is strongly localized near the metal surface. We used a scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscope (STM) to achieve real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction at the single-molecule level. A single dimethyl disulfide molecule on silver and copper surfaces was dissociated by the optically excited plasmon at the STM junction. The STM study combined with theoretical calculations shows that this plasmon-induced chemical reaction occurred by a direct intramolecular excitation mechanism.</p>

Real-time imaging of adatom-promoted graphene growth on nickel
<p>Single adatoms are expected to participate in many processes occurring at solid surfaces, such as the growth of graphene on metals. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, the catalytic role played by single metal adatoms during the technologically relevant process of graphene growth on nickel (Ni). The catalytic action of individual Ni atoms at the edges of a growing graphene flake was directly captured by scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscopy imaging at the millisecond time scale, while force field molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations rationalize the experimental observations. Our results unveil the mechanism governing the activity of a single-atom catalyst at work.</p>

Distinguishing a Majorana zero mode using spin-resolved measurements
<p>One-dimensional topological superconductors host Majorana zero modes (MZMs), the nonlocal property of which could be exploited for quantum computing applications. We use spin-polarized scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscopy to show that MZMs realized in self-assembled Fe chains on the surface of Pb have a spin polarization that exceeds that stemming from the magnetism of these chains. This feature, captured by our model calculations, is a direct consequence of the nonlocality of the Hilbert space of MZMs emerging from a topological band structure. Our study establishes spin-polarization measurements as a diagnostic tool to distinguish topological MZMs from trivial in-gap states of a superconductor.</p>

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry. This reaction was investigated with quantum state specificity by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of the vinylidene anions H<sub>2</sub>CC and D<sub>2</sub>CC and quantum dynamics calculations. Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an excited state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character. However, excitation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing-facilitated mixing with highly vibrationally excited states of acetylene, leading to b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>ening and/or spectral fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous vibrational levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

An algal photoenzyme converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons
<p>Although many organisms capture or respond to sunlight, few enzymes are known to be driven by light. Among these are DNA photolyases and the photosynthetic reaction centers. Here, we show that the microalga <i>Chlorella variabilis</i> NC64A harbors a photoenzyme that acts in lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to an algae-specific clade of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and catalyzes the decarboxylation of free fatty acids to n-alkanes or -alkenes in response to blue light. Crystal structure of the protein reveals a fatty acid–binding site in a hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> leading to the light-capturing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The decarboxylation is initiated through electron abstraction from the fatty acid by the photoexcited FAD with a quantum yield >80%. This photoenzyme, which we name fatty acid photodecarboxylase, may be useful in light-driven, bio-based production of hydrocarbons.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intersect</span></strong>s the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Nanocrystalline copper films are never flat
<p>We used scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscopy to study low-angle grain boundaries at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films. The presence of grain boundaries and their emergence at the film surface create valleys composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that valleys and ridges were created by an out-of-plane grain rotation driven by reduction of grain boundary energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

Bismuthene on a SiC substrate: A candidate for a high-temperature quantum spin Hall material
<p>Quantum spin Hall materials hold the promise of revolutionary devices with dissipationless spin currents but have required cryogenic temperatures owing to small energy gaps. Here we show theoretically that a room-temperature regime with a large energy gap may be achievable within a paradigm that exploits the atomic spin-orbit coupling. The concept is based on a substrate-supported monolayer of a high–atomic number element and is experimentally realized as a bismuth honeycomb lattice on top of the insulating silicon carbide substrate SiC(0001). Using scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing spectroscopy, we detect a gap of ~0.8 electron volt and conductive edge states consistent with theory. Our combined theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a concept for a quantum spin Hall wide-gap scenario, where the chemical potential resides in the global system gap, ensuring robust edge conductance.</p>

The impact of hunting on tropical mammal and bird populations
<p>Hunting is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced defaunation is lacking. We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics. Bird and mammal abundances declined by 58% (25 to 76%) and by 83% (72 to 90%) in hunted compared with unhunted areas. Bird and mammal populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters’ access points (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>s and settlements). Additionally, hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. Mammal population densities were lower outside protected areas, particularly because of commercial hunting. Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation.</p>

Photonic doping of epsilon-near-zero media
<p>Doping a semiconductor with foreign atoms enables the control of its electrical and optical properties. We transplant the concept of doping to macroscopic photonics, demonstrating that two-dimensional dielectric particles immersed in a two-dimensional epsilon-near-zero medium act as dopants that modify the medium’s effective permeability while keeping its effective permittivity near zero, independently of their positions within the host. The response of a large body can be tuned with a single impurity, including cases such as engineering perfect magnetic conductor and epsilon-and-mu-near-zero media with nonmagnetic constituents.

The cryo-EM structure of a ribosome–Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 helicase complex

We report that the Ski complex directly associates with 80<i>S</i> ribosomes presenting a short mRNA 3′ overhang. We determined the structure of an endogenous ribosome-Ski complex using cryo–electron microscopy (EM) with a local resolution of the Ski complex ranging from 4 angstroms (Å) in the core to about 10 Å for intrinsically flexible regions. Ribosome binding displaces the autoinhibitory domain of the Ski2 helicase, positioning it in an open conformation near the ribosomal mRNA entry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>.

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators
<p>Topological crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline symmetry leads to topologically protected surface states with a chiral spin texture, rendering them potential candidates for spintronics applications. Using scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of one-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic surface step edges of the three-dimensional topological crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent stability and protects them from backscattering. We experimentally show that this stability results in a striking robustness to defects, strong magnetic fields, and elevated temperature.</p>

Observation of a nematic quantum Hall liquid on the surface of bismuth

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters
<p>Biological methane formation starts with a challenging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–independent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation process. We explored this enzymatic process by solving the x-ray crystal structure of formyl-methanofuran dehydrogenase, determined here as Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>2</sub> and Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>4</sub> complexes, from <i>Methanothermobacter wolfeii</i>. The latter 800-kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4Fe-4S] clusters. Catalysis is separately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase. CO<sub>2</sub> is first reduced to formate in FwdBD, which then diffuses through a 43-angstrom-long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> to FwdA, where it condenses with methanofuran to formyl-methanofuran. The arrangement of [4Fe-4S] clusters functions as an electron relay but potentially also couples the four tungstopterin active sites over 206 angstroms.</p>

Leaf Endoplasmic Reticulum Bodies Identified in Arabidopsis Rosette Leaves Are Involved in Defense against Herbivory
<p>ER bodies are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles specific to the order Brassicales and are thought to function in plant defense against insects and pathogens. ER bodies are generally classified into two types: constitutive ER bodies in the epidermal cells of seedlings, and wound-inducible ER bodies in rosette leaves. Herein, we reveal a third type of ER body found in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette leaves and designate them “leaf ERbodies” (L-ER bodies). L-ER bodies constitutively occurred in specific cells of the rosette leaves: marginal cells, epidermal cells covering the midrib, and giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells. The distribution of L-ER bodies was closely associated with the expression profile of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NAI1, which is responsible for constitutive ER-body formation. L-ER bodies were seldom observed in <i>nai1</i> mutant leaves, indicating that NAI1 is involved in L-ER body formation. Confocal imaging analysis revealed that L-ER bodies accumulated two types of β-glucosidases: PYK10, the constitutive ER-body β-glucosidase; and BETA-GLUCOSIDASE18 (BGLU18), the wound-inducible ER-body β-glucosidase. Combined with the absence of L-ER bodies in the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant, these results indicate that BGLU18 and PYK10 are the major components of L-ER bodies. A subsequent feeding assay with the terrestrial isopod <i>Armadillidium vulgare</i> revealed that <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> leaves were severely damaged as a result of herbivory. In addition, the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant was defective in the hydrolysis of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate These results suggest that L-ER bodies are involved in the production of defensive compound(s) from 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate that protect Arabidopsis leaves against herbivory attack.</p>

Polyploidy Affects Plant Growth and Alters Cell Wall Composition
<p>Polyploidization has played a key role in plant breeding and crop improvement. Although its potential to increase biomass yield is well described, the effect of polyploidization on biomass composition has largely remained unexplored. Here, we generated a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with different somatic ploidy levels (2n, 4n, 6n, and 8n) and performed rigorous phenotypic characterization. Kinematic analysis showed that polyploids developed slower compared to diploids; however, tetra- and hexaploids, but not octaploids, generated larger rosettes due to delayed flowering. In addition, morphometric analysis of leaves showed that polyploidy affected epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells, with increased cell size and reduced cell number per leaf blade with incrementing ploidy. However, the inflorescence stem dry weight was highest in tetraploids. Cell wall characterization revealed that the basic somatic ploidy level negatively correlated with lignin and cellulose content, and positively correlated with matrix polysaccharide content (i.e. hemicellulose and pectin) in the stem tissue. In addition, higher ploidy plants displayed altered sugar composition. Such effects were linked to the delayed development of polyploids. Moreover, the changes in polyploid cell wall composition promoted saccharification yield. The results of this study indicate that induction of polyploidy is a promising breeding strategy to further tailor crops for biomass production.</p>

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis control gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the control of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and regulate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-specificity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by controlling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in controlling MAPK signaling specificity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong> map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the biological role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and biological function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the biological roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their biological function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct biological functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pavement</span></strong> cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

The impact of age on major orthopaedic trauma
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the early management and mortality of older patients   sustaining major orthopaedic trauma with that of a younger population   with similar injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Trauma Audit Research Network database was reviewed to identify   eligible patients admitted between April 2012 and June 2015. Distribution   and severity of injury, interventions, comorbidity, critical care   episodes and mortality were recorded. The population was divided   into young (64 years or younger) and older (65 years and older) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 142 765 adults sustaining major trauma, 72 942 (51.09 %) had   long bone or pelvic fractures and 45.81% of these were > 65 years   old. Road traffic collision was the most common mechanism in the   young (40.4%) and, in older people, fall from standing height (80.4%)   predominated. The 30 day mortality in older patients with fractures   is greater (6.8% <i>versus</i> 2.5%), although critical   care episodes are more common in the young (18.2% <i>versus</i> 9.7%).   Older people are less likely to be admitted to critical care beds   and are often managed in isolation by surgeons. Orthopaedic surgery   is the most common admitting and operating specialty and, in older   people, fracture surgery accounted for 82.1% of procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Orthopaedic trauma in older people is associated with mortality   that is significantly greater than for similar fractures in the   young. As with the hip fracture population, major trauma in the   elderly is a growing concern which highlights the need for a review   of admission pathways and shared orthogeriatric care models. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1677–80.</p></sec>

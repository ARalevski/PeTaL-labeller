High-quality graphene via microwave reduction of solution-exfoliated graphene oxide
<p>Efficient exfoliation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e in solutions to obtain high-quality graphene flakes is desirable for printable electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and composites. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions.</p>

Observation of second sound in graphite at temperatures above 100 K
<p>Wavelike thermal transport in solids, referred to as second sound, is an exotic phenomenon previously limited to a handful of materials at low temperatures. The rare occurrence of this effect restricted its scientific and practical importance. We directly observed second sound in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e at temperatures above 100 kelvins by using time-resolved optical measurements of thermal transport on the micrometer-length scale. Our experimental results are in qualitative agreement with ab initio calculations that predict wavelike phonon hydrodynamics. We believe that these results potentially indicate an important role of second sound in microscale transient heat transport in two-dimensional and layered materials in a wide temperature range.</p>

Finite phenine nanotubes with periodic vacancy defects
<p>Discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>ic carbon compounds serve as tunable models for the properties of extended macromolecular structures such as nanotubes. Here, we report synthesis and characterization of a cylindrical C<sub>304</sub>H<sub>264</sub> molecule composed of 40 benzene (phenine) units mutually bonded at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. The concise nine-step synthesis featuring successive borylations and couplings proceeded with an average yield for each benzene-benzene bond formation of 91%. The molecular structure of the nanometer-sized cylinder with periodic vacancy defects was confirmed spectroscopically and crystallographically. The nanoporous nature of the compound further enabled inclusion of multiple fullerene guests. Computations suggest that fusing many such cylinders could produce carbon nanotubes with electronic properties modulated by the periodic vacancy defects.</p>

High thermal conductivity in cubic boron arsenide crystals
<p>The high density of heat generated in power electronics and optoelectronic devices is a critical bottleneck in their application. New materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to effectively dissipate heat and thereby enable enhanced performance of power controls, solid-state lighting, communication, and security systems. We report the experimental discovery of high thermal conductivity at room temperature in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) grown through a modified chemical vapor transport technique. The thermal conductivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e. This work shows that BAs represents a class of ultrahigh–thermal conductivity materials predicted by a recent theory, and that it may constitute a useful thermal management material for high–power density electronic devices.</p>

Nitrogen fixation and reduction at boron
<p>Currently, the only compounds known to support fixation and functionalization of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) under nonmatrix conditions are based on metals. Here we present the observation of N<sub>2</sub> binding and reduction by a nonmetal, specifically a dicoordinate borylene. Depending on the reaction conditions under which potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>e is introduced as a reductant, N<sub>2</sub> binding to two borylene units results in either neutral (B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) or dianionic ([B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2–</sup>) products that can be interconverted by respective exposure to further reductant or to air. The <sup>15</sup>N isotopologues of the neutral and dianionic molecules were prepared with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled dinitrogen, allowing observation of the nitrogen nuclei by <sup>15</sup>N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Protonation of the dianionic compound with distilled water furnishes a diradical product with a central hydrazido B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> unit. All three products were characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically.</p>

MOF-derived cobalt nanoparticles catalyze a general synthesis of amines
<p>The development of base metal catalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds remains an important goal of chemical research. Here, we report that cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphit</span></strong>ic shell are broadly effective reductive amination catalysts. Their convenient and practical preparation entailed template assembly of cobalt-diamine-dicarboxylic acid metal organic frameworks on carbon and subsequent pyrolysis under inert atmosphere. The resulting stable and reusable catalysts were active for synthesis of primary, secondary, tertiary, and <i>N</i>-methylamines (more than 140 examples). The reaction couples easily accessible carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) with ammonia, amines, or nitro compounds, and molecular hydrogen under industrially viable and scalable conditions, offering cost-effective access to numerous amines, amino acid derivatives, and more complex drug targets.</p>

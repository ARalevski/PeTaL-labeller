De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments
<p>We describe a general computational approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ing self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ing helical filaments from monomeric proteins and use this approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> proteins that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e into micrometer-scale filaments with a wide range of geometries in vivo and in vitro. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s are close to the computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> models. The filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ation of new multiscale metamaterials.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and experiment increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> into a data-driven science.</p>

Clathrate colloidal crystals
<p>DNA-programmable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y has been used to deliberately synthesize hundreds of different colloidal crystals spanning dozens of symmetries, but the complexity of the achieved structures has so far been limited to small unit cells. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed DNA-modified triangular bipyramids (~250-nanometer long edge, 177-nanometer short edge) into clathrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es. Electron microscopy images revealed that at least three different structures form as large single-domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es or as multidomain materials. Ordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies, isostructural to clathrates, were identified with the help of molecular simulations and geometric analysis. These structures are the most sophisticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es made via programmable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, and their formation can be understood based on the shape of the nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks and mode of DNA functionalization.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. The process of supercomplex formation was t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rig</span></strong>gered before the completion of the NDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>s up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rig</span></strong>gered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>.</p>

“Perfect” designer chromosome V and behavior of a ring derivative

We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was constructed, which is fully functional in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability during meiosis. Ring synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ing synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e and will benefit the selection of ideal plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e in maize breeding.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong>ion; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>al trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Through cooperative self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies can program nonlinear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic circuits.</p>

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p>Adults older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in monocytes from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that monocytes from older adults exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that monocytes from older adults also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in monocytes, because knocking down IRF8 in monocytes from younger adults was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in monocytes from older adults, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older adult monocytes was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

Emergent simplicity in microbial community assembly
<p>A major unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the complex taxonomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">survey</span></strong>s of natural communities can be explained and predicted by fundamental, quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting communities are highly predictable and governed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of large microbial communities, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.</p>

High-resolution comparative analysis of great ape genomes
<p>Genetic studies of human evolution require high-quality contiguous ape genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies that are not guided by the human reference. We coupled long-read sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and full-length complementary DNA sequencing with a multiplatform scaffolding approach to produce ab initio chimpanzee and orangutan genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies. By comparing these with two long-read de novo human genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies and a gorilla genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, we characterized lineage-specific and shared great ape genetic variation ranging from single– to mega–base pair–sized variants. We identified ~17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman apes. Interestingly, these variants are enriched near genes that are down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoids, particularly in cells analogous to radial glial neural progenitors.</p>

Building superlattices from individual nanoparticles via template-confined DNA-mediated assembly
<p>DNA programmable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y has been combined with top-down lithography to construct superlattices of discrete, reconfigurable nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es on a gold surface over large areas. Specifically, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of individual colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes is controlled by oligonucleotides containing “locked” nucleic acids and confined environments provided by polymer pores to yield oriented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es that feature tunable arrangements and independently controllable distances at both nanometer- and micrometer-length scales. These structures, which would be difficult to construct by other common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y methods, provide a platform to systematically study and control light-matter interactions in nanoparticle-based optical materials. The generality and potential of this approach are explored by identifying a broadband absorber with a solvent polarity response that allows dynamic tuning of visible light absorption.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and library selection methods.</p>

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–coupled nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is essential to maintain genome integrity and retain epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is coupled to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-stranded DNA, has a role in replication-coupled nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA couples nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> ligand-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>es with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y.</p>

Multiplexed gene synthesis in emulsions for exploring protein functional landscapes
<p>Improving our ability to construct and functionally characterize DNA sequences would broadly accelerate progress in biology. Here, we introduce DropSynth, a scalable, low-cost method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> thousands of defined gene-length constructs in a pooled (multiplexed) manner. DropSynth uses a library of barcoded beads that pull down the oligonucleotides necessary for a gene’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, which are then processed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed in water-in-oil emulsions. We used DropSynth to successfully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong> more than 7000 synthetic genes that encode phylogenetically diverse homologs of two essential genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We tested the ability of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase homologs to complement a knockout <i>E. coli</i> strain in multiplex, revealing core functional motifs and reasons underlying homolog incompatibility. DropSynth coupled with multiplexed functional assays allows us to rationally explore sequence-function relationships at an unprecedented scale.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems
<p>Chemistries exhibiting complex dynamics—from inorganic oscillators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either cannot be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma. Can simpler molecular mechanisms, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems by identifying critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for complex chemical dynamics and that autonomous molecular systems can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed via molecular programming languages.</p>

Tunable porous nanoallotropes prepared by post-assembly etching of binary nanoparticle superlattices
<p>Self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of inorganic nanoparticles has been used to prepare hundreds of different colloidal crystals, but almost invariably with the restriction that the particles must be densely packed. Here, we show that non–close-packed nanoparticle arrays can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ated through the selective removal of one of two components comprising binary nanoparticle superlattices. First, a variety of binary nanoparticle superlattices were prepared at the liquid-air interface, including several arrangements that were previously unknown. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the particular role of the liquid in templating the formation of superlattices not achievable through self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y in bulk solution. Second, upon stabilization, all of these binary superlattices could be transformed into distinct “nanoallotropes”—nanoporous materials having the same chemical composition but differing in their nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es.</p>

A cargo-sorting DNA robot
<p>Two critical challenges in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and synthesis of molecular robots are modularity and algorithm simplicity. We demonstrate three modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks for a DNA robot that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple algorithm encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple robot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rig</span></strong>ami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rig</span></strong>ami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.</p>

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine
<p>The chemogenetic technology DREADD (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er receptors exclusively activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication
<p>Wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) is one of the founder crops that likely drove the Neolithic transition to sedentary agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Identifying genetic modifications underlying wheat’s domestication requires knowledge about the genome of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer (<i>T. turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccoides</i>). We report a 10.1-gigabase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of the 14 chromosomes of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e, and genetic diversity. With this fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed polyploid wheat genome, we identified the causal mutations in <i>Brittle Rachis 1</i> (<i>TtBtr1</i>) genes controlling shattering, a key domestication trait. A study of genomic diversity among wild and domesticated accessions revealed genomic regions bearing the signature of selection under domestication. This reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y will serve as a resource for accelerating the genome-assisted improvement of modern wheat varieties.</p>

Assembly principles and structure of a 6.5-MDa bacterial microcompartment shell
<p>Many bacteria contain primitive organelles composed entirely of protein. These bacterial microcompartments share a common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e of an enzymatic core encapsulated in a selectively permeable protein shell; prominent examples include the carboxysome for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and catabolic microcompartments found in many pathogenic microbes.

Despite available structural information for single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing blocks, the principles of shell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y have remained elusive. We present the crystal structure of an intact shell from <i>Haliangium ochraceum</i>, revealing the basic principles of bacterial microcompartment shell construction.

Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts
<p>The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin. During mitosis, duplicated nucleosome fibers are organized into a pair of rod-shaped structures (chromatids) within a mitotic chromosome. However, it remains unclear whether nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is indeed an essential prerequisite for mitotic chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. We combined mouse sperm nuclei and <i>Xenopus</i> cell-free egg extracts depleted of the histone chaperone Asf1 and found that chromatid-like structures could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed even in the near absence of nucleosomes. The resultant “nucleosome-depleted” chromatids contained discrete central axes positive for condensins, although they were more fragile than normal nucleosome-containing chromatids. Combinatorial depletion experiments underscored the central importance of condensins in mitotic chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, which sheds light on their functional cross-talk with nucleosomes in this process.</p>

Bug mapping and fitness testing of chemically synthesized chromosome X

A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell fitness (“bugs”). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex amplifications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in <i>FIP1</i>, and a loxPsym site affecting promoter function of <i>ATP2</i>. PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast genome debugging and an efficient strategy for phenotype-genotype mapping.</p>

Emergence of hierarchical structural complexities in nanoparticles and their assembly

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y tools. The adoption of plasmid vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">build</span></strong>ing on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of ribosome proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor of the 60S ribosome, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S ribosome biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in ribosome biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the chlorophyll-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of chlorophyll in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at an early stage of PSII de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and of PSII repair under high-light conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reconstruct</span></strong> representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e (RSA) of plants.

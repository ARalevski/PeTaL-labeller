On the generation of solar spicules and Alfvénic waves
<p>In the lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solar atmospher</span></strong>e, the chromosphere is permeated by jets known as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spicul</span></strong>es, in which plasma is propelled at speeds of 50 to 150 kilometers per second into the corona. The origin of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spicul</span></strong>es is poorly understood, although they are expected to play a role in heating the million-degree corona and are associated with Alfvéííénic waves that help drive the solar wind. We compare magnetohydrodynamic simulations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spicul</span></strong>es with observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spicul</span></strong>es are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported upward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar diffusion. The tension is impulsively released to drive flows, heat plasma (through ambipolar diffusion), and generate Alfvéííéénic waves.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photospher</span></strong>e cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photospher</span></strong>ic velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

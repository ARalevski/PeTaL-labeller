Prognostic Implications of Magnetic Resonance–Derived Quantification in Asymptomatic Patients With Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for the quantitative assessment of organic mitral regurgitation (OMR). The aim of the present study was to compare the discriminative power of MRI quantification and the recommended Doppler <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>cardiography (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>)–derived integrative approach to identify asymptomatic patients with OMR and adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 258 asymptomatic patients (63±14 years, 60% men) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%) and chronic moderate and severe OMR (flail 25%, prolapse 75%) defined by using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>-derived integrative approach. All patients underwent MRI to quantify regurgitant volume (RV) of OMR by subtracting the aortic forward flow volume from the total left ventricular stroke volume. Severe OMR was defined as RV≥60 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>-derived RV was on average 17.1 mL larger than the MRI-derived RV (<i>P</i><0.05). Concordant grading of OMR severity with both techniques was observed in 197 (76%) individuals with 62 (31%) patients having severe OMR (MRI SEV-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong> SEV) and 135 (69%) patients having moderate OMR (MRI MOD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong> MOD). The remaining 61 (24%) individuals had discordant findings (MRI SEV-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong> MOD or MRI MOD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong> SEV) between the 2 techniques. The majority of these differences in OMR classification were observed in patients with late systolic or multiple jets (both κ<0.2). Patients with eccentric jets showed moderate agreement (κ=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64). In contrast, a very good agreement (κ=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.98) was observed in a combination of holosystolic, central, and single jet. During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5–6.0 years), 38 (15%) patients died and 106 (41%) either died or developed indication for mitral valve surgery. In separate Cox regression analyses, the MRI-derived left ventricular end-systolic volume index, RV, and OMR category (severe versus moderate), and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>-derived OMR category were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (all <i>P</i><0.05). The MRI-derived RV showed the largest area under the curve to predict mortality (0.72) or its combination with the development of indication for mitral valve surgery (0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the MRI-derived assessment of OMR can better identify patients with severe OMR and adverse outcome than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>-derived integrative approach warranting close follow-up and perhaps, early mitral valve surgery.</p></sec>

Echo interval and not echo intensity drives bat flight behavior in structured corridors
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>locating bat encounters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong> cascades from objects at different relative positions: data show that the bat's flight guidance is driven by the timing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>es within cascades.</p>

Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent
<p>Current genetic data are equivocal as to whether goat domestication occurred multiple times or was a singular process. We generated genomic data from 83 ancient goats (51 with genome-wide coverage) from Paleolithic to Medieval contexts throughout the Near East. Our findings demonstrate that multiple divergent ancient wild goat sources were domesticated in a dispersed process that resulted in genetically and geographically distinct Neolithic goat populations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">echo</span></strong>ing contemporaneous human divergence across the region. These early goat populations contributed differently to modern goats in Asia, Africa, and Europe. We also detect early selection for pigmentation, stature, reproduction, milking, and response to dietary change, providing 8000-year-old evidence for human agency in molding genome variation within a partner species.</p>

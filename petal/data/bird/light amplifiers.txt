A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, microwave oscillators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al gyroscopes in a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> enters a regime of dynamics in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological insulators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>. These are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> provides a route to arrays of semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s that operate as one single-mode high-power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber las</span></strong>ers can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral filtering. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles. Multimode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber las</span></strong>ers thus open new directions in studies of nonlinear wave propagation and capabilities for applications.</p>

Vernier spectrometer using counterpropagating soliton microcombs
<p>Determination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> frequency with high resolution under continuous and abrupt tuning conditions is important for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. We show that a single microresonator provides rapid and broadband measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al frequencies with a relative frequency precision comparable to that of conventional dual-frequency comb systems. Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier spectrometer, which enabled characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-tuned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, multiline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> spectra, and molecular absorption lines. Besides providing a considerable technical simplification through the dual-locked solitons and enhanced capability for measurement of arbitrarily tuned sources, our results reveal possibilities for chip-scale spectrometers that exceed the performance of tabletop grating and interferometer-based devices.</p>

Quantum reference beacon–guided superresolution optical focusing in complex media
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al scattering is generally considered to be a nuisance of microscopy that limits imaging depth and spatial resolution. Wavefront shaping techniques enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al imaging at unprecedented depth, but attaining superresolution within complex media remains a challenge. We used a quantum reference beacon (QRB), consisting of solid-state quantum emitters with spin-dependent fluorescence, to provide subwavelength guidestar feedback for wavefront shaping to achieve a superresolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al focus. We implemented the QRB-guided imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al focusing with a subdiffraction resolution below 186 nanometers (less than half the wavelength). QRB-assisted wavefront-shaping should find use in a range of applications, including deep-tissue quantum enhanced sensing and individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al excitation of magnetically coupled spin ensembles for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging
<p>We used ultrahigh-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging to quantify the phenomenon of vapor depressions (also known as keyholes) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> melting of metals as practiced in additive manufacturing. Although expected from welding and inferred from postmortem cross sections of fusion zones, the direct visualization of the keyhole morphology and dynamics with high-energy x-rays shows that (i) keyholes are present across the range of power and scanning velocity used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> powder bed fusion; (ii) there is a well-defined threshold from conduction mode to keyhole based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> power density; and (iii) the transition follows the sequence of vaporization, depression of the liquid surface, instability, and then deep keyhole formation. These and other aspects provide a physical basis for three-dimensional printing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> powder bed machines.</p>

Supersymmetric laser arrays
<p>Scaling up the radiance of coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> arrays has been a long-standing challenge in photonics.

In this regard, a supersymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> array is realized that is capable of emitting exclusively in its fundamental transverse mode in a stable manner. Our results not only pave the way toward devising new schemes for scaling up radiance in integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, but also, on a more fundamental level, could shed light on the intriguing synergy between non-Hermiticity and supersymmetry.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al tweezers and then merges them into one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation of femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear crystal. In either case, the chemical properties of the lasing medium or the momentum conservation in the nonlinear crystal constrain the frequency and the bandwidth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed pulses. We demonstrate high gain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation (greater than 1000) of widely tunable (0.5 to 2.2 micrometers) and short (less than 60 femtosecond) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulses, up to intensities of 1 terawatt per square centimeter, by seeding the modulation instability in an Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> crystal pumped by femtosecond near-infrared pulses.

Chaos-assisted broadband momentum transformation in optical microresonators

Dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor with a free-running semiconductor disk laser

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual atomic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al experiments on the atomic scale. These atomic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> irradiation. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single atomic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual molecular bonds.

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able DNA lesions introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using templates with known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able lesions (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these lesions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine lesions, and C->T transitions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed uracil containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Suppressing spatiotemporal lasing instabilities with wave-chaotic microcavities
<p>Spatiotemporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatiotemporal chaos. These instabilities degrade the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> performance and are extremely challenging to control. We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatiotemporal instabilities using wave-chaotic or disordered cavities.

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in metals imposes a trade-off between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-metal heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and metal rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al response of both graphene and metal is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry.

<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al communication.</p>

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer formulations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials. The patterned materials can be metals, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth compositions. No organic impurities are present in the patterned layers, which helps achieve good electronic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al properties. The conductivity, carrier mobility, dielectric, and luminescence properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>ally patterned layers are on par with the properties of state-of-the-art solution-processed materials. The ability to directly pattern all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

Metalloprotein entatic control of ligand-metal bonds quantified by ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy
<p>The multifunctional protein cytochrome c (cyt c) plays key roles in electron transport and apoptosis, switching function by modulating bonding between a heme iron and the sulfur in a methionine residue. This Fe–S(Met) bond is too weak to persist in the absence of protein constraints. We ruptured the bond in ferrous cyt c using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulse and monitored the bond reformation within the protein active site using ultrafast x-ray pulses from an x-ray free-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>, determining that the Fe–S(Met) bond enthalpy is ~4 kcal/mol stronger than in the absence of protein constraints. The 4 kcal/mol is comparable with calculations of stabilization effects in other systems, demonstrating how biological systems use an entatic state for modest yet accessible energetics to modulate chemical function.</p>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity

Large, valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>
<p>Coherent interaction with off-resonance light can be used to shift the energy levels of atoms, molecules, and solids. The dominant effect is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Stark shift, but there is an additional contribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert shift that has eluded direct and exclusive observation in solids. We observed an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) under infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al driving. By controlling the light helicity, we could confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur only at one valley, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Stark shift at the other valley, because the two effects obey opposite selection rules at different valleys. Such a large and valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift allows for enhanced control over the valleytronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al circuits.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

A topological quantum optics interface

Our approach creates robust counterpropagating edge states at the boundary of two distinct topological photonic crystals.

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas

Control over the intrinsic properties, including their complex refractive index, size, and geometry, has been used to manipulate fundamental light absorption, scattering, and emission processes in nanostructured optoelectronic devices.

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak.

Here, we report efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">four-wave mix</span></strong>ing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency mixing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Femtosecond laser reshaping yields gold nanorods with ultranarrow surface plasmon resonances
<p>The irradiation of gold nanorod colloids with a femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> can be tuned to induce controlled nanorod reshaping, yielding colloids with exceptionally narrow localized surface plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and volume are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the heat dissipation rate: Low cooling rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast cooling has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between irradiation fluence and surface density of the surfactant on the nanorods. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold nanorods with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit.</p>

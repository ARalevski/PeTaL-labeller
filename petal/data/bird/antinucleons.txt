Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antiparticl</span></strong>e. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of magnetization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many magnetic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological quantum computing.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antiparticl</span></strong>e have the same mass. The antiproton-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-photon transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-photon experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

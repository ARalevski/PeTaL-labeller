Randomized Comparisons of Double-Dose Clopidogrel or Adjunctive Cilostazol Versus Standard Dual Antiplatelet in Patients With High Posttreatment Platelet Reactivity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention react differently to antiplatelet drugs. Those with low responsiveness to clopidogrel have a higher risk of cardiac ischemic events. The goal of this study is to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the safety and effectiveness of intensified antiplatelet therapies (either double-dose clopidogrel [DOUBLE] or adjunctive cilostazol [TRIPLE]) and conventional strategy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>) in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized, controlled trial, we used thromboelastography, a platelet function test, to select 1078 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at high thrombotic risk and compared the intensified antiplatelet therapies with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 18 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stroke. Bleeding Academic Research Consortium defined bleeding complications (types 1, 2, 3, or 5) were the safety end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary end point occurred in 52 patients (14.4%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> group, 38 patients (10.6%) in the DOUBLE group, and 30 patients (8.5%) in the TRIPLE group (hazard ratio, 0.720; 95% confidence interval, 0.474–1.094, DOUBLE versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>; hazard ratio, 0.550; 95% confidence interval, 0.349–0.866, TRIPLE versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>). No significant difference in the rates of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium grade≥3) was found in the DOUBLE group (3.34% versus 1.93% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.133) and the TRIPLE group (2.53% versus 1.93% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.240). The rate of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium–defined minor bleeding increased in the DOUBLE group (27.4% versus 20.3% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.031), but not in the TRIPLE group (23.6% versus 20.3% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.146).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with low responsiveness to clopidogrel, as measured by thromboelastography, the intensified antiplatelet strategies with adjunctive use of cilostazol significantly improved the clinical outcomes without increasing the risk of major bleeding. Decreased trend of negative outcomes could be observed in patients with double dosage of clopidogrel, but the difference was not significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indications   for re-operations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-operations, revisions with modular   component exchange, and revisions with non-modular component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-operation, modular   component revision and non-modular component revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indications for a   re-operation were: post-operative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   component revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%). The most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indications for non-modular   component revision were chronic PJI (52%), aseptic loosening (17%), periprosthetic   fracture (10%), and instability (10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Post-operative stiffness remains the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indication for   re-operation after TKA. Infection is the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indication   for modular and non-modular component revision. Aseptic loosening   was not an un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> cause of failure, however, it was much less   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> than in national registry and non-registry data.

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified. The final risk adjustment model included procedure-type risk category, number of hemodynamic vulnerability indicators, renal insufficiency, single-ventricle physiology, and coagulation disorder. The model had good discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.76 and 0.75 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Model calibration in the validation cohort was excellent, with a slope of 0.97 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.04; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 1] =0.53) and an intercept of 0.007 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.12; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 0] =0.95).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The creation of a validated risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization model for adverse outcomes after congenital cardiac catheterization can support reporting of risk-adjusted outcomes in the IMPACT Registry as a foundation for quality improvement.</p></sec>

Effect of Ferric Carboxymaltose on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Iron deficiency is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> in patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and poor outcomes. Whether correction of iron deficiency with (intravenous) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) affects peak oxygen consumption [peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>], an objective measure of exercise intolerance in HF, has not been examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45%) and mild to moderate symptoms despite optimal HF medication. Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with FCM for 24 weeks or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> of care. The primary end point was the change in peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary end points included the effect on hematinic and cardiac biomarkers, quality of life, and safety. For the primary analysis, patients who died had a value of 0 imputed for 24-week peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of imputation of missing peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 172 patients with HF were studied and received FCM (n=86) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> of care (control group, n=86). At baseline, the groups were well matched; mean age was 64 years, 75% were male, mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 32%, and peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> was 13.5 mL/min/kg. FCM significantly increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. At 24 weeks, peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> had decreased in the control group (least square means −1.19±0.389 mL/min/kg) but was maintained on FCM (−0.16±0.387 mL/min/kg; <i>P</i>=0.020 between groups). In a sensitivity analysis, in which missing data were not imputed, peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> at 24 weeks decreased by −0.63±0.375 mL/min/kg in the control group and by −0.16±0.373 mL/min/kg in the FCM group; <i>P</i>=0.23 between groups).

Although a favorable effect on peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> was observed on FCM, compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> of care in the primary analysis, this effect was highly sensitive to the imputation strategy for peak V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub> among patients who died.

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival. However, the extent of hospital variation in delayed epinephrine administration and its effect on hospital-level outcomes is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103 932 adult patients (≥18 years) at 548 hospitals with an in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to a nonshockable rhythm who received at least 1 dose of epinephrine between 2000 and 2014. We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in rates of delayed epinephrine administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital rates of survival to discharge and survival with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this rate varied markedly across hospitals (range, 0%–53.8%). The odds of delay in epinephrine administration were 58% higher at 1 randomly selected hospital in comparison with a similar patient at another randomly selected hospital (median odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.64). The median risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized survival rate was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized survival with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%). There was an inverse correlation between a hospital’s rate of delayed epinephrine administration and its risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized rate of survival to discharge (ρ=–0.22, <i>P</i><0.0001) and survival with functional recovery (ρ=–0.14, <i>P</i>=0.001). In comparison with a median survival rate of 12.9% (interquartile range, 11.1%–15.4%) at hospitals in the lowest quartile of epinephrine delay, risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized survival was 16% lower at hospitals in the quartile with the highest rate of epinephrine delays (10.8%; interquartile range, 9.7%–12.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Delays in epinephrine administration following in-hospital cardiac arrest are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> and variy across hospitals. Hospitals with high rates of delayed epinephrine administration had lower rates of overall survival for in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to nonshockable rhythm.

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls.

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and phenotype over 800 genetically modified mouse lines over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. Phenotyping includes the generation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical phenotypes detected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> MGP primary phenotyping screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary screen detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> primary screen. Three of these seven lines had no clinical phenotype detected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> primary screen. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary phenotyping of mutant mice.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the young remains a largely unsolved public health problem, and sports activity is an established trigger. Although the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> cardiovascular risk factors in the young can link to future morbidity and mortality in adulthood, the potential contribution of these risk factors to SCA in the young has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively ascertained subjects who experienced SCA between the ages of 5 and 34 years in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area (2002–2015, catchment population ≈1 million). We assessed the circumstances, resuscitation outcomes, and clinical profile of subjects who had SCA by a detailed evaluation of emergency response records, lifetime clinical records, and autopsy examinations. We specifically evaluated the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> cardiovascular risk factors and SCA, and sports as a trigger for SCA in the young.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 3775 SCAs in all age groups, 186 (5%) occurred in the young (mean age 25.9±6.8, 67% male). In SCA in the young, overall prevalence of warning signs before SCA was low (29%), and 26 (14%) were associated with sports as a trigger. The remainder (n=160) occurred in other settings categorized as nonsports. Sports-related SCAs accounted for 39% of SCAs in patients aged ≤18, 13% of SCAs in patients aged 19 to 25, and 7% of SCAs in patients aged 25 to 34. Sports-related SCA cases were more likely to present with shockable rhythms, and survival from cardiac arrest was 2.5-fold higher in sports-related versus nonsports SCA (28% versus 11%; <i>P</i>=0.05). Overall, the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> SCA-related conditions were sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (31%), coronary artery disease (22%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (14%). There was an unexpectedly high overall prevalence of established cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) with ≥1 risk factors in 58% of SCA cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sports was a trigger of SCA in a minority of cases, and, in most patients, SCA occurred without warning symptoms. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> cardiovascular risk factors were found in over half of patients, suggesting the potential role of public health approaches that screen for cardiovascular risk factors at earlier ages.</p></sec>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to drug-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging drugs. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched QT and plasma drug concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT score comprising 61 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s drug-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus drug concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The genetic QT score was correlated with drug-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% confidence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT score was a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=12%, <i>P</i>=1×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate that a genetic QT score comprising 61 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes. These findings highlight an opportunity for recent genetic discoveries to improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for pharmacological therapies. Replication of these findings in larger samples is needed to more precisely estimate variance explained and to establish the individual variants that drive these effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and combined stresses (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different biological processes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> stress genes were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

The impact of age on major orthopaedic trauma
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the early management and mortality of older patients   sustaining major orthopaedic trauma with that of a younger population   with similar injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Trauma Audit Research Network database was reviewed to identify   eligible patients admitted between April 2012 and June 2015. Distribution   and severity of injury, interventions, comorbidity, critical care   episodes and mortality were recorded. The population was divided   into young (64 years or younger) and older (65 years and older) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 142 765 adults sustaining major trauma, 72 942 (51.09 %) had   long bone or pelvic fractures and 45.81% of these were > 65 years   old.

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep learning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   searched the literature for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The research question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 years (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears were the   most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). Nerve injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> complications. There   were 58 major complications (0.2%), the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> being intra-abdominal   extravasation of fluid, which was found in 13 cases (0.04%). There   were three deaths (0.008%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Arthroscopic surgery of the hip is a procedure with a relatively   low rate of complications, although some may be significant in this   young cohort of patients. This study relied on the reported complications   only and the results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1577–83.</p></sec>

Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Community trends of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (≥55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> in white women. Average age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types. Only blacks showed decreased 1-year mortality over time (average annual percentage change: black women –5.4%, black men –4.6%), with rates differing by HF type (average annual percentage change: black women HFpEF –7.1%, black men HF with reduced ejection fraction –4.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2014, trends in ADHF hospitalizations increased in 4 US communities, primarily driven by acute HFpEF.

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood pressure. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. Pharmacological stimulation of nitric oxide signaling may prove useful in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is currently unknown whether intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering beyond that recommended would lead to more lowering of the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension and whether reducing the risk of LVH explains the reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits of intensive BP lowering in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This analysis included 8164 participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 35.3% women; 31.2% blacks) with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus from the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial): 4086 randomly assigned to intensive BP lowering (target SBP <120 mm Hg) and 4078 assigned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> BP lowering (target SBP <140 mm Hg). Progression and regression of LVH as defined by Cornell voltage criteria derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> 12-lead ECGs recorded at baseline and biannually were compared between treatment arms during a median follow-up of 3.81 years. The effect of intensive (versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>) BP lowering on the SPRINT primary CVD outcome (a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, and CVD death) was compared before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among SPRINT participants without baseline LVH (n=7559), intensive (versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>) BP lowering was associated with a 46% lower risk of developing LVH (hazard ratio=0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.68). Similarly, among SPRINT participants with baseline LVH (n=605, 7.4%), those assigned to the intensive (versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>) BP lowering were 66% more likely to regress/improve their LVH (hazard ratio=1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.11). Adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate did not substantially attenuate the effect of intensive BP therapy on CVD events (hazard ratio of intensive versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> BP lowering on CVD, 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.90] and 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.91] before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus, intensive BP lowering (target systolic BP <120 mm Hg) compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> BP lowering (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg) resulted in lower rates of developing new LVH in those without LVH and higher rates of regression of LVH in those with existing LVH.

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FINRISK, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> risk factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable risk by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely associated with incident AF with a greater risk reduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90 versus 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.023). No sex differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable risk of all risk factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men. About 20% of the risk was observed for body mass index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risk of AF was high, and AF was strongly associated with increased mortality both in women and men. Body mass index explained the largest proportion of AF risk.

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction

Here, we evaluated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Validity of Cardiovascular Data From Electronic Sources
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Understanding the validity of data from electronic data research networks is critical to national research initiatives and learning healthcare systems for cardiovascular care. Our goal was to evaluate the degree of agreement of electronic data research networks in comparison with data collected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized research approaches in a cohort study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked individual-level data from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a community-based cohort, with HealthLNK, a 2006 to 2012 database of electronic health records from 6 Chicago health systems. To evaluate the correlation and agreement of blood pressure in HealthLNK in comparison with in-person MESA examinations, and body mass index in HealthLNK in comparison with MESA, we used Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. Using diagnoses in MESA as the criterion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, we calculated the performance of HealthLNK for hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus diagnosis by using <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data. We also identified potential myocardial infarctions, strokes, and heart failure events in HealthLNK and compared them with adjudicated events in MESA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 1164 MESA participants enrolled at the Chicago Field Center, 802 (68.9%) participants had data in HealthLNK. The correlation was low for systolic blood pressure (0.39; <i>P</i><0.0001). In comparison with MESA, HealthLNK overestimated systolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 4.2–7.8). There was a high correlation between body mass index in MESA and HealthLNK (0.94; <i>P</i><0.0001). HealthLNK underestimated body mass index by 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval, –0.4 to –0.1). With the use of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data, the sensitivity and specificity of HealthLNK queries for hypertension were 82.4% and 59.4%, for obesity were 73.0% and 89.8%, and for diabetes mellitus were 79.8% and 93.3%. In comparison with adjudicated cardiovascular events in MESA, the concordance rates for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure were, respectively, 41.7% (5/12), 61.5% (8/13), and 62.5% (10/16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings illustrate the limitations and strengths of electronic data repositories in comparison with information collected by traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized epidemiological approaches for the ascertainment of cardiovascular risk factors and events.</p></sec>

Neurological Injury and Cerebral Blood Flow in Single Ventricles Throughout Staged Surgical Reconstruction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle experience a high rate of brain injury and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome; however, the incidence of brain abnormalities throughout surgical reconstruction and their relationship with cerebral blood flow, oxygen delivery, and carbon dioxide reactivity remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle were studied with magnetic resonance imaging scans immediately prior to bidirectional Glenn (pre-BDG), before Fontan (BDG), and then 3 to 9 months after Fontan reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred sixty-eight consecutive subjects recruited into the project underwent 235 scans: 63 pre-BDG (mean age, 4.8±1.7 months), 118 BDG (2.9±1.4 years), and 54 after Fontan (2.4±1.0 years). Nonacute ischemic white matter changes on T2-weighted imaging, focal tissue loss, and ventriculomegaly were all more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly detected in BDG and Fontan compared with pre-BDG patients (<i>P</i><0.05). BDG patients had significantly higher cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients. The odds of discovering brain injury with adjustment for surgical stage as well as ≥2 coexisting lesions within a patient decreased (63%–75% and 44%, respectively) with increasing amount of cerebral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05). In general, there was no association of oxygen delivery (except for ventriculomegaly in the BDG group) or carbon dioxide reactivity with neurological injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant brain abnormalities are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly present in patients with a single ventricle, and detection of these lesions increases as children progress through staged surgical reconstruction, with multiple coexisting lesions more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> earlier than later. In addition, this study demonstrated that BDG patients had greater cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients and that an inverse association exists of various indexes of cerebral blood flow with these brain lesions. However, CO<sub>2</sub> reactivity and oxygen delivery (with 1 exception) were not associated with brain lesion development.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Equalisation of leg lengths in total hip arthroplasty for patients with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There is no consensus about the best method of achieving equal   leg lengths at total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with Crowe   type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). We reviewed our   experience of a consecutive series of patients who underwent THA   for this indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients (86 THAs) with Crowe   type-IV DDH, including 64 women and 14 men, with a minimum follow-up   of two years. The mean age at the time of surgery was 52.2 years   (34 to 82). We subdivided Crowe type-IV DDH into two major types   according to the number of dislocated hips, and further categorised   them into three groups according to the occurrence of pelvic obliquity   or spinal curvature. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) and functional   scores were analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Type-I included 53 patients with unilateral dislocation, in which   25 (category A) had no pelvic obliquity or spinal deformity, 19   (category B) had pelvic obliquity with a compensated spinal curvature   and nine (category C) had pelvic obliquity and decompensated spinal   degenerative changes.</p><p>Type-II included 25 patients with one dislocated and one dysplastic   hip, in which there were eight of category A, 15 of category B and   two of category C.</p><p>Pre-operatively, there were significant differences between the   anatomical and functional LLD in type-IB (p = 0.005) and -IC (p   < 0.001), but not in type-IA, -IIA or -IIB.</p><p>Post-operatively, bony LLD increased significantly in types-IB,   -IC and -IIB, whereas functional LLD decreased significantly in   each type except for IIA.

Cement-in-cement revision of the femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Compared with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), revision   surgery can be challenging. The cement-in-cement femoral revision   technique involves removing a femoral component from a well-fixed   femoral cement mantle and cementing a new stem into the original   mantle. This technique is widely used and when carried out for the   correct indications, is fast, relatively inexpensive and carries   a reduced short-term risk for the patient compared with the alternative   of removing well-fixed cement. We report the outcomes of this procedure   when two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly used femoral stems are used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 1179 cement-in-cement stem revisions involving   an Exeter or a Lubinus stem reported to the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register (SHAR) between January 1999 and December 2015. Kaplan-Meier   survival analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Survivorship is reported up to six years and was better in the   Exeter group (91% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 2.8% <i>versus</i> 85% <sc>sd</sc> 5.0%)   (p = 0.02). There was, however, no significant difference in the   survival of the stem and risk of re-revision for any reason (p =   0.58) and for aseptic loosening (p = 0.97), between revisions in   which the Exeter stem (94% <sc>sd</sc> 2.2%; 98% <sc>sd</sc> 1.6%)   was used compared with those in which the Lubinus stem (95% <sc>sd</sc> 3.2%;   98% <sc>sd</sc> 2.2%) was used. The database did not allow identification   of whether a further revision was indicated for loosening of the acetabular   or femoral component or both.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cement-in-cement technique for revision of the femoral component   gave promising results using both designs of stem, six years post-operatively.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):27–32.</p></sec>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Bone penetration of intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin as antibiotic prophylaxis during total hip and knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate the bone penetration of intravenous antibiotic   prophylaxis with flucloxacillin and gentamicin during hip and knee   arthroplasty, and their efficacy against <i>Staphylococcus</i> (<i>S.</i>) <i>aureus</i> and <i>S.   epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Bone samples from the femoral head, neck and acetabulum were   collected from 18 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and from the femur and tibia in 21 patients during total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). The concentration of both antibiotics in the samples was   analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. Penetration   was expressed as a percentage of venous blood concentration. The   efficacy against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> infecting organisms was measured against   both the minimum inhibitory concentration 50, and the more stringent epidemiological   cutoff value for resistance (ECOFF).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The bone penetration of gentamicin was higher than flucloxacillin.   Relative to ECOFF, flucloxacillin concentrations were effective   against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. epidermidis</i> in   all THAs and 20 (95%) TKAs. Gentamicin concentrations were effective   against <i>S. epidermidis</i> in all bone samples. Gentamicin   was effective against <i>S. aureus</i> in 11 (61.1%) femoral   neck samples in THA. Effective concentrations of gentamicin against <i>S.   aureus</i> were only achieved in four (19%) femoral and six   (29%) tibial samples in TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Flucloxacillin and gentamicin were found to penetrate bone during   THA and TKA. Gentamicin was effective against <i>S. epidermidis</i> in   both THA and TKA, while levels were subtherapeutic against <i>S.   aureus</i> in most TKAs. Bone penetration of both antibiotics   was less in TKA than THA, and may relate to the use of a tourniquet.   Using this antibiotic combination, effective cover against the two   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> infective organisms was achieved in all THAs and all but   one TKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:358–64.</p></sec>

Multiple boluses of intravenous tranexamic acid to reduce hidden blood loss and the inflammatory response following enhanced-recovery primary total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety   of multiple boluses of intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid (TXA) on   the hidden blood loss (HBL) and inflammatory response following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 150 patients were allocated randomly to receive a   single bolus of 20 mg/kg IV TXA before the incision (group A), a   single bolus followed by a second bolus of 1 g IV-TXA three hours   later (group B) or a single bolus followed by two boluses of 1 g   IV-TXA three and six hours later (group C). All patients were treated   using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> peri-operative enhanced recovery protocol. Primary   outcomes were HBL and the level of haemoglobin (Hb) as well as the   levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as markers   of inflammation. Secondary outcomes included the length of stay   in hospital and the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean HBL was significantly lower in group C (402.13 ml <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>   deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 225.97) than group A (679.28 ml<sc> sd</sc> 277.16,   p < 0.001) or B (560.62 ml <sc>sd</sc> 295.22, p = 0.010). The   decrease in the level of Hb between the pre-operative baseline and   the level on the third post-operative day was 30.82 g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 6.31   g/L) in group A, 27.16 g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 6.83) in group B and 21.98   g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 3.72) in group C. This decrease differed significantly   among the three groups (p < 0.01). The mean level of CRP was   significantly lower in group C than in the other two groups on the   second (p ≤ 0.034) and third post-operative days (p ≤ 0.014). The   levels of IL-6 were significantly lower in group C than group A   on the first three post-operative days (p = 0.023).

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart.

How Do Resuscitation Teams at Top-Performing Hospitals for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Succeed?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>, and outcomes vary substantially across US hospitals, but reasons for these differences are largely unknown. We set out to better understand how top-performing hospitals organize their resuscitation teams to achieve high survival rates for IHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We calculated risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized IHCA survival to discharge rates across American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry hospitals between 2012 and 2014. We identified geographically and academically diverse hospitals in the top, middle, and bottom quartiles of survival for IHCA and performed a qualitative study that included site visits with in-depth interviews of clinical and administrative staff at 9 hospitals. With the use of thematic analysis, data were analyzed to identify salient themes of perceived performance by informants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 9 hospitals, we interviewed 158 individuals from multiple disciplines including physicians (17.1%), nurses (45.6%), other clinical staff (17.1%), and administration (20.3%). We identified 4 broad themes related to resuscitation teams: (1) team design, (2) team composition and roles, (3) communication and leadership during IHCA, and (4) training and education. Resuscitation teams at top-performing hospitals demonstrated the following features: dedicated or designated resuscitation teams; participation of diverse disciplines as team members during IHCA; clear roles and responsibilities of team members; better communication and leadership during IHCA; and in-depth mock codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Resuscitation teams at hospitals with high IHCA survival differ from non–top-performing hospitals. Our findings suggest core elements of successful resuscitation teams that are associated with better outcomes and form the basis for future work to improve IHCA.</p></sec>

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and overtesting are key concerns, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and efficiency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an efficiency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1) and an efficiency of 49.9% (95% CI, 47.7–52.2) for the ADD-RS ≤1/DD− strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Integration of ADD-RS (either ADD-RS=0 or ADD-RS ≤1) with DD may be considered to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ize diagnostic rule out of AAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Comparison of Reduced-Dose Prasugrel and Standard-Dose Clopidogrel in Elderly Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes Undergoing Early Percutaneous Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elderly patients are at elevated risk of both ischemic and bleeding complications after an acute coronary syndrome and display higher on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity compared with younger patients. Prasugrel 5 mg provides more predictable platelet inhibition compared with clopidogrel in the elderly, suggesting the possibility of reducing ischemic events without increasing bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial, we compared a once-daily maintenance dose of prasugrel 5 mg with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> clopidogrel 75 mg in patients >74 years of age with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary end point was the composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, disabling stroke, and rehospitalization for cardiovascular causes or bleeding within 1 year. The study was designed to demonstrate superiority of prasugrel 5 mg over clopidogrel 75 mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enrollment was interrupted, according to prespecified criteria, after a planned interim analysis, when 1443 patients (40% women; mean age, 80 years) had been enrolled with a median follow-up of 12 months, because of futility for efficacy. The primary end point occurred in 121 patients (17%) with prasugrel and 121 (16.6%) with clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.007; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.30; <i>P</i>=0.955). Definite/probable stent thrombosis rates were 0.7% with prasugrel versus 1.9% with clopidogrel (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.06).

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indirect cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> cause of death. This highlights the importance of the development of protocols for the quick identification and management of cardiac tamponade even in procedures typically believed to be lower risk such as device implantation.</p></sec>

Clinical Profile and Consequences of Atrial Fibrillation in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> sustained arrhythmia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), is capable of producing symptoms that impact quality of life and is associated with risk for embolic stroke. However, the influence of AF on clinical course and outcome in HCM remains incompletely resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Records of 1558 consecutive patients followed at the Tufts Medical Center Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Institute for 4.8±3.4 years (from 2004 to 2014) were accessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 1558 patients with HCM, 304 (20%) had episodes of AF, of which 226 (74%) were confined to symptomatic paroxysmal AF (average, 5±5; range, 1 to >20), whereas 78 (26%) developed permanent AF, preceded by 7±6 paroxysmal AF episodes. At last evaluation, 277 patients (91%) are alive at 62±13 years of age, including 89% in New York Heart Association class I or II. No difference was found in outcome measures for patients with AF and age- and sex-matched patients with HCM without AF. Four percent of patients with AF died of HCM-related causes (n=11), with annual mortality 0.7%; mortality directly attributable to AF (thromboembolism without prophylactic anticoagulation) was 0.1% per year (n=2 patients). Patients were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly amiodarone [n=103] or sotalol [n=78]) and AF catheter ablation (n=49) or the Maze procedure at surgical myectomy (n=72). Freedom from AF recurrence at 1 year was 44% for ablation patients and 75% with the Maze procedure (<i>P</i><0.001). Embolic events were less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> with anticoagulation prophylaxis (4/233, 2%) than without (9/66, 14%) (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transient symptomatic episodes of AF, often responsible for impaired quality of life, are unpredictable in frequency and timing, but amenable to effective contemporary treatments, and infrequently progress to permanent AF. AF is not a major contributor to heart failure morbidity or a cause of arrhythmic sudden death; when treated, it is associated with low disease-related mortality, no different than for patients without AF. AF is an un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> primary cause of death in HCM virtually limited to embolic stroke, supporting a low threshold for initiating anticoagulation therapy.</p></sec>

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

We calculated risks and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized incidence ratios of cancer for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts cancer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without pericarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with cancer during follow-up. The overall cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic cancer. The <3-month cancer risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2–13.7). The 3- to <12-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized incidence ratio of cancer was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0–1.2).

Risk for Major Bleeding in Patients Receiving Ticagrelor Compared With Aspirin After Transient Ischemic Attack or Acute Ischemic Stroke in the SOCRATES Study (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at high risk for subsequent stroke, and more potent antiplatelet therapy in the acute setting is needed. However, the potential benefit of more intense antiplatelet therapy must be assessed in relation to the risk for major bleeding. The SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes) was the first trial with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in which the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were compared with those of aspirin. The main safety objective was assessment of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)–defined major bleeds on treatment, with special focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An independent adjudication committee blinded to study treatment classified bleeds according to the PLATO, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) definitions. The definitions of ICrH and major bleeding excluded cerebral microbleeds and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of cerebral infarctions so that the definitions better discriminated important events in the acute stroke population.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 13 130 of 13 199 randomized patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. PLATO major bleeds occurred in 31 patients (0.5%) on ticagrelor and 38 patients (0.6%) on aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–1.34). The most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> locations of major bleeds were intracranial and gastrointestinal. ICrH was reported in 12 patients (0.2%) on ticagrelor and 18 patients (0.3%) on aspirin. Thirteen of all 30 ICrHs (4 on ticagrelor and 9 on aspirin) were hemorrhagic strokes, and 4 (2 in each group) were symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of brain infarctions. The ICrHs were spontaneous in 6 and 13, traumatic in 3 and 3, and procedural in 3 and 2 patients on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively. In total, 9 fatal bleeds occurred on ticagrelor and 4 on aspirin. The composite of ICrH or fatal bleeding included 15 patients on ticagrelor and 18 on aspirin. Independently of bleeding classification, PLATO, TIMI, or GUSTO, the relative difference between treatments for major/severe bleeds was similar. Nonmajor bleeds were more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> on ticagrelor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack showed a bleeding profile similar to that of aspirin for major bleeds.

After catheterization, a transvenous pacing catheter was placed and adenosine was given following a dose-escalation protocol until atrioventricular block was achieved. The incidence of clinically significant asystole (≥12 seconds after adenosine) was quantified. The effects of patient characteristics on adenosine dose required to produce atrioventricular block and duration of effect were also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eighty patients completed adenosine testing. No patient (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0–3) required rescue ventricular pacing. Atrioventricular block was observed in 77 patients (96%; 95% confidence interval, 89–99). The median longest atrioventricular block was 1.9 seconds (interquartile range, 1.4–3.2 seconds), with a mean duration of adenosine effect of 4.3±2.0 seconds. No patient characteristic significantly predicted the adenosine dose to produce atrioventricular block or duration of effect. Results were similar across patient weight categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Adenosine induces atrioventricular block in healthy pediatric and young adult heart transplant recipients with minimal risk when low initial doses are used (25 μg/kg; 1.5 mg if ≥60 kg) and therapy is gradually escalated.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Comparative Prognostic Utility of Indexes of Microvascular Function Alone or in Combination in Patients With an Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is frequently successful at restoring coronary artery blood flow in patients with acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction; however, failed myocardial reperfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly passes undetected in up to half of these patients. The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a novel invasive measure of coronary microvascular function. We aimed to investigate the pathological and prognostic significance of an IMR>40, alone or in combination with a coronary flow reserve (CFR≤2.0), in the culprit artery after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction were prospectively enrolled during emergency percutaneous coronary intervention and categorized according to IMR (≤40 or >40) and CFR (≤2.0 or >2.0). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was acquired 2 days and 6 months after myocardial infarction. All-cause death or first heart failure hospitalization was a prespecified outcome (median follow-up, 845 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IMR and CFR were measured in the culprit artery at the end of percutaneous coronary intervention in 283 patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (mean±SD age, 60±12 years; 73% male). The median IMR and CFR were 25 (interquartile range, 15–48) and 1.6 (interquartile range, 1.1–2.1), respectively. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of myocardial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–4.27; <i>P</i>=0.042). An IMR>40 was closely associated with microvascular obstruction. Symptom-to-reperfusion time, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) blush grade, and no (≤30%) ST-segment resolution were not associated with these pathologies. An IMR>40 was a multivariable associate of the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (coefficient, −2.12; 95% confidence interval, −4.02 to −0.23; <i>P</i>=0.028) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (coefficient, 7.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–15.29; <i>P</i>=0.039) at 6 months independently of infarct size. An IMR>40 (odds ratio, 4.36; 95% confidence interval, 2.10–9.06; <i>P</i><0.001) was a multivariable associate of all-cause death or heart failure. Compared with an IMR>40, the combination of IMR>40 and CFR≤2.0 did not have incremental prognostic value.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An IMR>40 is a multivariable associate of left ventricular and clinical outcomes after ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction independently of the infarction size. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> clinical measures of the efficacy of myocardial reperfusion, including the ischemic time, ST-segment elevation, angiographic blush grade, and CFR, IMR has superior clinical value for risk stratification and may be considered a reference test for failed myocardial reperfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https//www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Nationwide Study of the Treatment of Mycotic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Comparing Open and Endovascular Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No reliable comparative data exist between open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms (MAAAs). This nationwide study assessed outcomes after OR and EVAR for MAAA in a population-based cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for MAAAs in Sweden between 1994 and 2014 were identified in the Swedish vascular registry. The primary aim was to assess survival after MAAA with OR and EVAR. Secondary aims were analyses of the rate of recurrent infections and reoperations, and time trends in surgical treatment. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. A propensity score–weighted correction for risk factor differences in the 2 groups was performed, including the operation year to account for differences in treatment and outcomes over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 132 patients (0.6% of all operated abdominal aortic aneurysms in Sweden). Mean age was 70 years (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> deviation, 9.2), and 50 presented with rupture. Survival at 3 months was 86% (95% confidence interval, 80%–92%), at 1 year 79% (72%–86%), and at 5 years 59% (50%–68%). The preferred operative technique shifted from OR to EVAR after 2001 (proportion EVAR 1994–2000 0%, 2001–2007 58%, 2008–2014 60%). Open repair was performed in 62 patients (47%): aortic resection and extra-anatomic bypass (n=7), in situ reconstruction (n=50), and patch plasty (n=3); 2 patients died intraoperatively. EVAR was performed in 70 patients (53%): <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> EVAR (n=55), fenestrated/branched EVAR (n=8), and visceral deviation with stent grafting (n=7); no deaths occurred intraoperatively. Survival at 3 months was lower for OR than for EVAR (74% versus 96%, <i>P</i><0.001), with a similar trend present at 1 year (73% versus 84%, <i>P</i>=0.054). A propensity score–weighted risk-adjusted analysis confirmed the early better survival associated with EVAR. During median follow-up of 36 and 41 months for OR and EVAR, respectively, there was no difference in long-term survival (5 years 60% versus 58%, <i>P</i>=0.771), infection-related complications (18% versus 24%, <i>P</i>=0.439), or reoperation (21% versus 24%, <i>P</i>=0.650).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in treatment of MAAA in Sweden, with EVAR being the preferred treatment modality. EVAR was associated with improved short-term survival in comparison with OR, without higher associated incidence of serious infection-related complications or reoperations.</p></sec>

Cardiac Mortality Among 200 000 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are acknowledged as understudied. Little is known about their long-term adverse health risks, particularly of cardiac disease that is increased in other cancer populations where cardiotoxic treatments have been used.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study cohort comprises 200 945 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed at 15 to 39 years of age in England and Wales from 1971 to 2006, and followed to 2014. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative risks were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac disease. For all cancers combined, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized mortality ratios for all cardiac diseases combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4–5.2) decreasing to 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 years (2<i>P</i> for trend <0.0001). Similar patterns were observed for both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks for ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, genitourinary cancers other than bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, leukaemia other than acute myeloid, central nervous system tumour, cervical cancer, and breast cancer experienced 3.8, 2.7, 2.0, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 times the number of cardiac deaths expected from the general population, respectively. Among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma aged over 60 years, almost 30% of the total excess number of deaths observed were due to heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study of over 200 000 cancer survivors shows that age at cancer diagnosis was critical in determining subsequent cardiac mortality risk. For the first time, risk estimates of cardiac death after each cancer diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39 years have been derived from a large population-based cohort with prolonged follow-up. The evidence here provides an initial basis for developing evidence-based follow-up guidelines.</p></sec>

Outcomes of Temporary Interruption of Rivaroxaban Compared With Warfarin in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>During long-term anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation, temporary interruptions (TIs) of therapy are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>, but the relationship between patient outcomes and TIs has not been well studied. We sought to determine reasons for TI, the characteristics of patients undergoing TI, and the relationship between anticoagulant and outcomes among patients with TI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF), a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study of rivaroxaban and warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes, including stroke, non–central nervous system systemic embolism, death, myocardial infarction, and bleeding, were reported in participants who experienced TI (3–30 days) for any reason. The at-risk period for outcomes associated with TI was from TI start to 30 days after resumption of study drug. In 14 236 participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 4692 (33%) experienced TI. Participants with TI were similar to the overall ROCKET AF population in regard to baseline clinical characteristics. Only 6% (n=483) of TI incidences involved bridging therapy. Stroke/systemic embolism rates during the at-risk period were similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.30% versus 0.41% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=0.74 [0.36–1.50]; <i>P</i>=0.40). Risk of major bleeding during the at-risk period was also similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.99% versus 0.79% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=1.26 [0.80–2.00]; <i>P</i>=0.32).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>TI of oral anticoagulation is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> and is associated with substantial stroke risks and bleeding risks that were similar among patients treated with rivaroxaban or warfarin.

Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Transthyretin-Related Versus Light-Chain Cardiac Amyloidosis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Immunoglobulin amyloid light-chain (AL)-related cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has a worse prognosis than either wild-type (ATTRwt) or mutant (ATTRm) transthyretin (TTR) CA. Detailed echocardiographic studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis but not in TTR amyloidosis and might give insight into this difference. We assessed cardiac structure and function and outcome in a large population of patients with CA and compared findings in TTR and AL-related disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We analyzed 172 patients with CA (AL amyloidosis, n=80; ATTRm, n=36; ATTRwt, n=56) by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> echocardiography and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal (LS), radial, and circumferential strains. Despite a preserved LV ejection fraction (55±12%), LS was severely impaired in CA. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> measures of LV function and speckle-tracking imaging worsened as wall thickness increased, whereas apical LS was preserved regardless of the pathogenesis of CA and the degree of wall thickening. Compared with ATTRm and AL amyloidosis, ATTRwt was characterized by greater LV wall thickness and lower ejection fraction. LS was more depressed in both ATTRwt and AL amyloidosis (−11±3% and −12±4%, respectively, <i>P</i>=0.54) than in ATTRm (−15±4%, <i>P</i><0.01 versus AL amyloidosis and ATTRwt). TTR-related causes were favorable predictors of survival, whereas LS and advanced New York Heart Association class were negative predictors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients with CA, worsening LV function correlated with increasing wall thickness regardless of pathogenesis. Patients with ATTRwt had a statistically greater wall thickness but lesser mortality than those with AL amyloidosis, despite very similar degrees of LS impairment. This paradox suggests an additional mechanism for LV dysfunction in AL amyloidosis, such as previously demonstrated light-chain toxicity.</p></sec>

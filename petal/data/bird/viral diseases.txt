Universal protection against influenza infection by a multidomain antibody to influenza hemagglutinin
<p>Broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable pathogens have stimulated the design of vaccines and therapeutics. We report the use of diverse camelid single-domain antibodies to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> hemagglutinin to generate multidomain antibodies with impressive breadth and potency. Multidomain antibody MD3606 protects mice against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> A and B infection when administered intravenously or expressed locally from a recombinant adeno-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> vector. Crystal and single-particle electron microscopy structures of these antibodies with hemagglutinins from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> A and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es reveal binding to highly conserved epitopes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that multidomain antibodies targeting multiple epitopes exhibit enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> cross-reactivity and potency. In combination with adeno-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>–mediated gene delivery, they may provide an effective strategy to prevent infection with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> and other highly variable pathogens.</p>

Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines
<p>The conversion of life-threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es into live but avirulent vaccines represents a revolution in vaccinology. In a proof-of-principle study, we expanded the genetic code of the genome of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> via a transgenic cell line containing orthogonal translation machinery. This generated premature termination codon (PTC)–harboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells. Genome-wide optimization of the sites for incorporation of multiple PTCs resulted in highly reproductive and genetically stable progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in transgenic cells. In mouse, ferret, and guinea pig models, vaccination with PTC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es elicited robust humoral, mucosal, and T cell–mediated immunity against antigenically distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and even neutralized existing infecting strains. The methods presented here may become a general approach for generating live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> vaccines that can be adapted to almost any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>.</p>

Role for migratory wild birds in the global spread of avian influenza H5N8
<p>Avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es affect both poultry production and public health. A subtype H5N8 (clade 2.3.4.4) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, following an outbreak in poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread worldwide in 2014–2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological investigations, waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that long-distance migratory birds can play a major role in the global spread of avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the circumpolar circulation of avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in migratory waterfowl will help to provide early warning of threats from avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> to poultry, and potentially human, health.</p>

MAVS-dependent host species range and pathogenicity of human hepatitis A virus
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>otropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are important causes of human disease, but the intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic immune response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es is poorly understood because of a lack of tractable small- animal models.

We demonstrate that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-mediated type I interferon responses defines its host species range. HAV-induced liver injury was associated with interferon-independent intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ocellular apoptosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic inflammation that unexpectedly resulted from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling.

Metropolitan versus small-town influenza
<p>Every year, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> epidemics occur during winter in regions with temperate climates. The duration, size, and precise timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> epidemics vary from season to season—the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths can be substantial. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> epidemic in the winter of 2017–2018 in the United States was extraordinarily severe and long, straining the health care system capacity. Various external factors have been proposed to explain the duration, size, and precise timing of seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> epidemics, including weakened immune systems during winter, increased social crowding indoors, school leave during the Christmas holiday, and the lower humidity in winter. Inferring the relative importance of each of those factors is difficult because they act on a dynamic process that responds sensitively to changes and that is only observable with a measure of error (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>). How can we determine what is driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> epidemics? On page 75 of this issue, Dalziel <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> epidemics in a city are driven by fluctuations in humidity, modulated by the population size. This implies that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> control measures could work differently in large metropolitan areas compared to small towns.</p>

Potent peptidic fusion inhibitors of influenza virus
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> therapeutics with new targets and mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat potential pandemics, emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, and constantly mutating strains in circulation. We report here on the design and structural characterization of potent peptidic inhibitors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> hemagglutinin. The peptide design was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly neutralizing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114).

Giant viruses with an expanded complement of translation system components
<p>The discovery of giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es blurred the sharp division between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and cellular life. Giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> genomes encode proteins considered as signatures of cellular organisms, particularly translation system components, prompting hypotheses that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es derived from a fourth domain of cellular life. Here we report the discovery of a group of giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es (Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es) in metagenomic data. Compared with other giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, the Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es encode an expanded translation machinery, including aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases with specificities for all 20 amino acids. Notwithstanding the prevalence of translation system components, comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of these genes indicates that Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es did not evolve from a cellular ancestor but rather are derived from a much smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> through extensive gain of host genes.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> acquisition and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

<i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i>: A Viral Vector for Protein Expression in Cereals
<p>Rapid and cost-effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-derived transient expression systems for plants are invaluable in elucidating gene function and are particularly useful in plant species for which transformation-based methods are unavailable or are too time and labor demanding, such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-mediated overexpression (VOX) vectors based on <i>Barley stripe mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and <i>Wheat streak mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> described previously for these species are incapable of expressing free recombinant proteins of more than 150 to 250 amino acids, are not suited for high-throughput screens, and have other limitations. In this study, we report the development of a VOX vector based on a monopartite single-stranded positive sense RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, <i>Foxtail mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (genus <i>Potex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i>). In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>. Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral vaccines, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for vaccine development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> as a vaccine candidate. HIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for vaccine development against other pathogens.</p>

First flu is forever
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> is a threat that has been with humans throughout history, fueled by a constant race between host immunity and viral evolution. Control strategies rely on annual immunizations and require frequent updates of the vaccine, an expensive, cumbersome, and not always foolproof process. Efforts are therefore under way to develop vaccines that confer broadly cross-protective immunity to diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> strains. Cross-immunity is pervasive in nature; in multistrain viral diseases such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> or dengue, response to a primary infection can profoundly influence response to the next strain encountered. Even unrelated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es can be recognized by the same cross-reactive T cells. On page 722 of this issue (<i>1</i>), Gostic <i>et al.</i> show that severe infection with a bird flu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> depends on the individual's first encounter with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> in childhood.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in this intermediate host used to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> H3N2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger positive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with positively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed wing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee immune system.</p>

Predicting reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors from evolutionary signatures in RNA virus genomes

In Pakistan, surveillance for polio reveals a paradox
<p>Last year polio fighters could smell victory in Pakistan, which many believe will be the last country on Earth to harbor the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>.

Surely, there were not enough susceptible children to sustain transmission, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> would burn itself out within a year. Unsettling new findings, however, show it is far from gone. In the most extensive effort in any country to scour the environment for traces of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, polio workers are finding it widely across Pakistan, in places they thought it had disappeared. They are wondering "just what the hell is going on" and how worried they should be, says epidemiologist Chris Maher of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, who runs polio operations in the eastern Mediterranean region. Does this mean the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> is more entrenched than anyone realized and is poised to resurge?

Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral immune mechanisms.

Whereas immune-compromised mice developed persistent infection, immune-competent mice cleared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury. Transient depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before infection resulted in chronic infection, characterized by high levels of intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Mechanism-Based Covalent Neuraminidase Inhibitors with Broad-Spectrum Influenza Antiviral Activity
<sec><title>Adding to the Antiviral Arsenal</title><p>The envelope of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> contains two immunodominant glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (NA).

NA catalyzes the removal of sialic acids from the surface of host cells to initiate entry. Discovery of a NA–sialic acid intermediate led to the production of sialic acid analogs that bound covalently to NA and inhibited its enzymatic activity. These compounds showed activity against a wide variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> strains, inhibited viral replication in cell culture, and were able to protect mice against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> infection.

Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylates a Geminivirus Rep Protein to Impair Viral Replication and Infection
<p>Gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are single-stranded DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that infect a wide variety of plants and cause severe crop losses worldwide. The gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication initiator protein (Rep) binds to the viral replication origin and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation to initiate rolling circle replication. In this study, we found that the <i>Tomato golden mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (TGMV) Rep is phosphorylated at serine-97 by sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), a master regulator of plant energy homeostasis and metabolism. Phosphorylation of Rep or the phosphomimic S97D mutation impaired Rep binding to viral DNA. A TGMV DNA-A replicon containing the Rep S97D mutation replicated less efficiently in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) protoplasts than in wild-type or Rep phosphorylation-deficient replicons. The TGMV Rep-S97D mutant also was less infectious than the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and was unable to infect tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Nearly all gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> Rep proteins have a serine residue at the position equivalent to TGMV Rep serine-97. SnRK1 phosphorylated the equivalent serines in the Rep proteins of <i>Tomato mottle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and reduced DNA binding, suggesting that SnRK1 plays a key role in combating gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection. These results established that SnRK1 phosphorylates Rep and interferes with gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication and infection, underscoring the emerging role for SnRK1 in the host defense response against plant pathogens.</p>

Potato Mop-Top Virus Co-Opts the Stress Sensor HIPP26 for Long-Distance Movement
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> movement proteins facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> entry into the vascular system to initiate systemic infection. The potato mop-top <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (PMTV) movement protein, TGB1, is involved in long-distance movement of both viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and virions. Here, our analysis of TGB1 interactions with host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> proteins revealed an interaction with a member of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein family, HIPP26, which acts as a plasma membrane-to-nucleus signal during abiotic stress. We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> long-distance movement but did not affect cell-to-cell movement. Drought and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from drought. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where interaction with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the drought stress response and facilitating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> long-distance movement.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA poty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

<i>PARP12</i> suppresses Zika virus infection through PARP-dependent degradation of NS1 and NS3 viral proteins
<p>Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection stimulates a type I interferon (IFN) response in host cells, which suppresses viral replication. Type I IFNs exert antiviral effects by inducing the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To screen for antiviral ISGs that restricted Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication, we individually knocked out 21 ISGs in A549 lung cancer cells and identified PARP12 as a strong inhibitor of Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication. Our findings suggest that PARP12 mediated the ADP-ribosylation of NS1 and NS3, nonstructural viral proteins that are involved in viral replication and modulating host defense responses. This modification of NS1 and NS3 triggered their proteasome-mediated degradation. These data increase our understanding of the antiviral activity of PARP12 and suggest a molecular basis for the potential development of therapeutics against Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, lipid-overloaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ocytes and in the livers of patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains lipid homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

Unphosphorylated ISGF3 drives constitutive expression of interferon-stimulated genes to protect against viral infections
<p>Interferon (IFN)–stimulated genes (ISGs) are antiviral effectors that are induced by IFNs through the formation of a tripartite transcription factor ISGF3, which is composed of IRF9 and phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT2. However, we found that IFN-independent ISG expression was detectable in immortalized cell lines, primary intestinal and liver organoids, and liver tissues. The constitutive expression of ISGs was mediated by the unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) complex, consisting of IRF9 together with unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2. Under homeostatic conditions, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 were found in the nucleus. Analysis of a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set revealed that STAT1 specifically bound to the promoters of ISGs even in the absence of IFNs. Knockdown of STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 by RNA interference led to the decreased expression of various ISGs in Huh7.5 human liver cells, which was confirmed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from <i>STAT1</i><sup>−/−</sup>, <i>STAT2</i><sup>−/−</sup>, or <i>IRF9</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Furthermore, decreased ISG expression was accompanied by increased replication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. Conversely, simultaneous overexpression of all ISGF3 components, but not any single factor, induced the expression of ISGs and inhibited viral replication; however, no phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 were detected. A phosphorylation-deficient STAT1 mutant was comparable to the wild-type protein in mediating the IFN-independent expression of ISGs and antiviral activity, suggesting that ISGF3 works in a phosphorylation-independent manner. These data suggest that the U-ISGF3 complex is both necessary and sufficient for constitutive ISG expression and antiviral immunity under homeostatic conditions.</p>

The host microRNA miR-301a blocks the IRF1-mediated neuronal innate immune response to Japanese encephalitis virus infection
<p>Effective recognition of viral components and the subsequent stimulation of the production of type I interferons (IFNs) is crucial for the induction of host antiviral immunity. The failure of the host to efficiently produce type I IFNs in response to infection by the Japanese <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enceph</span></strong>alitis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (JEV) is linked with an increased probability for the disease to become lethal. JEV is a neurotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family that causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enceph</span></strong>alitis in humans. JEV infection is regulated by several host factors, including microRNAs, which are conserved noncoding RNAs that participate in various physiological and pathological processes. We showed that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> led to inhibition of the production of type I IFN by reducing the abundances of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the signaling protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5). Mechanistically, induction of <i>miR-301a</i> expression during JEV infection required the transcription factor nuclear factor κB. In mouse neurons, neutralization of miR-301a restored the host innate immune response by enabling IFN-β production, thereby restricting viral propagation. Inhibition of miR-301a in mouse brain rescued the production of IRF1 and SOCS5, increased the generation of IFN-β, and reduced the extent of JEV replication, thus improving mouse survival. Thus, our study suggests that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> assists viral pathogenesis by suppressing IFN production, which might be targeted by antiviral therapies.</p>

Polio outbreaks in the DRC threaten eradication effort
<p>There's an alarming polio outbreak in the Democratic of the Congo (DRC) that you have probably never heard of. Part of the reason is that it is overshadowed by Ebola. But part is because it is caused not by the wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> that is hanging on by a thread in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and perhaps Nigeria, but by a rare mutant derived from the weakened live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in the oral polio vaccine, which has regained its neurovirulence and ability to spread. Public health experts have worked for months to stamp out the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, but it keeps spreading. It has already paralyzed 29 children, and on 21 June a case was reported on the border with Uganda, far outside the known outbreak zone, heightening fears that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> will sweep across Africa. The DRC is "absolutely" the most worrisome polio outbreak today, says Michel Zaffran, who heads the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in Geneva at the World Health Organization.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in vaccinated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

The microbial metabolite desaminotyrosine protects from influenza through type I interferon
<p>The microbiota is known to modulate the host response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> infection through as-yet-unclear mechanisms. We hypothesized that components of the microbiota exert effects through type I interferon (IFN), a hypothesis supported by analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> in a gain-of-function genetic mouse model. Here we show that a microbially associated metabolite, desaminotyrosine (DAT), protects from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> through augmentation of type I IFN signaling and diminution of lung immunopathology. A specific human-associated gut microbe, <i>Clostridium orbiscindens,</i> produced DAT and rescued antibiotic-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong>-infected mice. DAT protected the host by priming the amplification loop of type I IFN signaling. These findings show that specific components of the enteric microbiota have distal effects on responses to lethal infections through modulation of type I IFN.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> became far more susceptible to disease and death from Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an immune gene that normally helps suppress Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that infect humans. Infection with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the antibodies produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly disease if they subsequently become infected by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> family and the researchers warn that a vaccine against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue antibodies led to the most severe Zika disease. ADE also led to high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system diseases like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to support the intercellular movement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle movement assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-terminal half of P3 fused to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open reading frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (TuMV), in the intercellular movement of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to support the PD targeting and intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in transmission electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a docking point for PD targeting and the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular movement of viral replication vesicles.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect irido<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the females were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and females continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected males were quicker to court females than uninfected controls. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Urbanization and humidity shape the intensity of influenza epidemics in U.S. cities
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> epidemics vary in intensity from year to year, driven by climatic conditions and by viral antigenic evolution. However, important spatial variation remains unexplained. Here we show predictable differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> incidence among cities, driven by population size and structure. Weekly incidence data from 603 cities in the United States reveal that epidemics in smaller cities are focused on shorter periods of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> season, whereas in larger cities, incidence is more diffuse. Base transmission potential estimated from city-level incidence data is positively correlated with population size and with spatiotemporal organization in population density, indicating a milder response to climate forcing in metropolises. This suggests that urban centers incubate critical chains of transmission outside of peak climatic conditions, altering the spatiotemporal geometry of herd immunity.</p>

<p>In the first 2 months of this year, Nigeria has had more confirmed cases of Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic disease that kills 20% to 30% of those it sickens, than in any previous year. As of 11 March, the toll from this rodent-borne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> stood at 365 confirmed cases, 16 of those among vulnerable health care workers, and 114 deaths. And those figures are widely considered an underestimate. As the government and its international partners scramble to set up isolation wards and deliver protective gear to health workers, researchers on three continents are racing to figure out what is driving the unprecedented outbreak and what it portends for the future. Is it simply better disease surveillance in the wake of Ebola, the similar but more deadly disease that began its rampage across West Africa in 2014? Has the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> changed in some way? Are there more of the rats that carry it, or are more rats infected with it? Or is another rat capable of spreading the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> as well? Considering how lethal Lassa fever is, shockingly little is known about it, experts say.</p>

An interferon-independent lncRNA promotes viral replication by modulating cellular metabolism
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es regulate host metabolic networks to improve their survival. The molecules that are responsive to viral infection and regulate such metabolic changes are hardly known, but are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, but not by type I interferon (IFN-I), and facilitates viral replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by its nearest coding gene <i>Acod1</i>, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection through IFN-I–IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3)–independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-ACOD1 directly binds the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its metabolites could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality. This work reveals a feedback mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced lncRNA-mediated metabolic promotion of viral infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics.</p>

A glycerophospholipid-specific pocket in the RVFV class II fusion protein drives target membrane insertion
<p>The Rift Valley fever <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (RVFV) is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, causing severe disease in humans and livestock across Africa. We determined the x-ray structure of the RVFV class II fusion protein Gc in its postfusion form and in complex with a glycerophospholipid (GPL) bound in a conserved cavity next to the fusion loop. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations further revealed a built-in motif allowing en bloc insertion of the fusion loop into membranes, making few nonpolar side-chain interactions with the aliphatic moiety and multiple polar interactions with lipid head groups upon membrane restructuring. The GPL head-group recognition pocket is conserved in the fusion proteins of other arthropod-borne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, such as Zika and chikungunya <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, which have recently caused major epidemics worldwide.</p>

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the vaccine varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the vaccine had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the vaccine change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in the 6–8 months that pass between the vaccine being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the vaccine during the manufacturing process, which grows the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in eggs. People's prior exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> also can bias their immune system toward a response that undermines that vaccine-triggered immunity. And the vaccine strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the vaccine and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Enhancement of Zika virus pathogenesis by preexisting antiflavivirus immunity
<p>Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (ZIKV) is spreading rapidly into regions around the world where other flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, such as dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (DENV) and West Nile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (WNV), are endemic. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been implicated in more severe forms of flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> disease, but whether this also applies to ZIKV infection is unclear. Using convalescent plasma from DENV- and WNV-infected individuals, we found substantial enhancement of ZIKV infection in vitro that was mediated through immunoglobulin G engagement of Fcγ receptors. Administration of DENV- or WNV-convalescent plasma into ZIKV-susceptible mice resulted in increased morbidity—including fever, viremia, and viral loads in spinal cord and testes—and increased mortality. Antibody-dependent enhancement may explain the severe disease manifestations associated with recent ZIKV outbreaks and highlights the need to exert great caution when designing flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> vaccines.</p>

New bird flu strain brings death and questions
<p>The avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong> strain H5N8 has spread from Asia to many countries in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, infecting both wild birds and poultry; hundreds of thousands of birds have been culled to halt the epidemic. H5N8 is a distant descendant of the H5N1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> that devastated flocks across much of the world and killed hundreds of people more than a decade ago. The good news is that so far, it does not seem to infect humans. But its rapid spread and increasing deadliness to birds have mystified experts. And it underscores that avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">influenza</span></strong>, once an occasional crisis, is now endemic in the burgeoning flocks of Asia, from which it periodically spreads in migrating birds.</p>

Deciphering the Glycosylome of Dystroglycanopathies Using Haploid Screens for Lassa Virus Entry
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and Congenital Disorders</title><p>Mutations in genes involved in α-dystroglycan O-linked glycosylation result in posttranslation modifications associated with the congenital disease Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS). This cellular modification is also required for efficient Lassa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection of cells. <bold>Jae <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 479, published online 21 March) screened for genes involved in O-glycosylation that affected Lassa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection and identified candidates involved in glycosylation. Individuals from different pedigrees exhibiting WWS had unique mutations among genes identified in the genetic screen. Thus, comprehensive forward genetic screens can be used to define the genetic architecture of a complex disease.</p></sec>

Persistent LCMV Infection Is Controlled by Blockade of Type I Interferon Signaling
<sec><title>INTERFER(ON)ing Persistence</title><p>During persistent viral infections, a dysregulated immune response fails to control the infection. <bold>Wilson <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 202) and <bold>Teijaro <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 207; see the Perspective by <bold>Odorizzi and Wherry</bold>) show this occurs because type I interferons (IFN I), critical for early responses to viral infection, contribute to the altered immunity seen during persistent infection.

An Interferon Paradox
<p>Type 1 interferons (IFN-α/β) are a major first line of host defense against viral infection. Because of this potent antiviral activity, IFN-based therapies have been developed for chronic infections with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis B and C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, as well as for HIV. However, a poorly understood phenomenon has been the persistence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> despite induction of antiviral immune responses by type 1 IFNs. On page 207 and 202 in this issue, Teijaro <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) and Wilson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) address this long-standing question and find that IFN-α/β can also suppress the immune system in ways that promote viral persistence. This paradoxical finding should spur a reassessment of the fundamental roles of IFN-α/β during chronic infections.</p>

The MAPK Kinase Kinase GmMEKK1 Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses
<p>MAPK signaling pathways play critical roles in plant immunity. Here, we silenced multiple genes encoding MAPKs using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced gene silencing mediated by <i>Bean pod mottle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> to identify MAPK genes involved in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) immunity. Surprisingly, a strong hypersensitive response (HR) cell death was observed when soybean <i>MAPK KINASE KINASE1</i> (<i>GmMEKK1</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>MEKK1</i>, was silenced. The HR was accompanied by the overaccumulation of defense signaling molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide. Genes involved in primary metabolism, translation/transcription, photosynthesis, and growth/development were down-regulated in <i>GmMEKK1-</i>silenced plants, while the expression of defense-related genes was activated. Accordingly, <i>GmMEKK1</i>-silenced plants were more resistant to downy mildew (<i>Peronospora manshurica</i>) and <i>Soybean mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> compared with control plants. Silencing <i>GmMEKK1</i> reduced the activation of GmMPK6 but enhanced the activation of <i>Gm</i>MPK3 in response to flg22 peptide. Unlike Arabidopsis MPK4, <i>Gm</i>MPK4 was not activated by either flg22 or SA. Interestingly, transient overexpression of <i>GmMEKK1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> also induced HR. Our results indicate that <i>Gm</i>MEKK1 plays both positive and negative roles in immunity and appears to differentially activate downstream MPKs by promoting <i>Gm</i>MPK6 activation but suppressing GmMPK3 activation in response to flg22. The involvement of <i>Gm</i>MPK4 kinase activity in cell death and in flg22- or SA-triggered defense responses in soybean requires further investigation.</p>

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p>Chloroplasts are multifunctional organelles whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid membranes has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of chloroplast under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand RNA ((+)RNA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, barley stripe mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (BSMV) to observe chloroplast structural changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the chloroplast membranes, characterized by the clustering of outer membrane-invaginated spherules in inner membrane-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of cytoplasmic invaginations (CIs) were evident with spherules at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the cytoplasm. Immunoelectron microscopy of these viral components verified that the aberrant membrane structures were sites for BSMV replication. The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the chloroplasts and played a prominent role in eliciting chloroplast membrane rearrangements. In sum, our results have revealed the 3D structure of the chloroplasts induced by BSMV infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of chloroplast morphological changes under stress conditions and during assembly of plant (+)RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication complexes.</p>

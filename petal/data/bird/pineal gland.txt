Type 2 diabetes–associated variants of the MT<sub>2</sub> melatonin receptor affect distinct modes of signaling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melatonin</span></strong> is produced during the night and regulates sleep and circadian rhythms. Loss-of-function variants in <i>MTNR1B</i>, which encodes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melatonin</span></strong> receptor MT<sub>2</sub>, a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To identify specific T2D-associated signaling pathway(s), we profiled the signaling output of 40 MT<sub>2</sub> variants by monitoring spontaneous (ligand-independent) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melatonin</span></strong>-induced activation of multiple signaling effectors. Genetic association analysis showed that defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melatonin</span></strong>-induced activation of Gα<sub>i1</sub> and Gα<sub>z</sub> proteins and in spontaneous β-arrestin2 recruitment to MT<sub>2</sub> were the most statistically significantly associated with an increased T2D risk. Computational variant impact prediction by in silico evolutionary lineage analysis strongly correlated with the measured phenotypic effect of each variant, providing a predictive tool for future studies on GPCR variants. Together, this large-scale functional study provides an operational framework for the postgenomic analysis of the multiple GPCR variants present in the human population. The association of T2D risk with signaling pathway–specific defects opens avenues for pathway-specific personalized therapeutic intervention and reveals the potential relevance of MT<sub>2</sub> function during the day, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melatonin</span></strong> is undetectable, but spontaneous activity of the receptor occurs.</p>

Ultrafast neuronal imaging of dopamine dynamics with designed genetically encoded sensors
<p>Neuromodulatory systems exert profound influences on brain function. Understanding how these systems modify the operating mode of target circuits requires spatiotemporally precise measurement of neuromodulator release. We developed dLight1, an intensity-based genetically encoded dopamine indicator, to enable optical recording of dopamine dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution in behaving mice. We demonstrated the utility of dLight1 by imaging dopamine dynamics simultaneously with pharmacological manipulation, electrophysiological or optogenetic stimulation, and calcium imaging of local neuronal activity. dLight1 enabled chronic tracking of learning-induced changes in millisecond dopamine transients in mouse striatum. Further, we used dLight1 to image spatially distinct, functionally heterogeneous dopamine transients relevant to learning and motor control in mouse cortex. We also validated our sensor design platform for developing norepinephrine, serotonin, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melatonin</span></strong>, and opioid neuropeptide indicators.</p>

Chirping and asymmetric jamming avoidance responses in the electric fish <i>Distocyclus conirostris</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> An asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">jam</span></strong>ming avoidance response in a gregarious electric fish with a low-frequency electric organ discharge could function in communication as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">jam</span></strong>ming avoidance.</p>

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ically activated, slowly adapting currents in sensory neurons have been linked to noxious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>osensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>osensation blocker-1) blocks such currents and inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory neurons and a sensory neuron–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical stimuli. Sensory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>o-gated current linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ically activated, slowly adapting currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons inhibited rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons attenuated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ically evoked pain is particularly problematic. These data suggest that annexin A6 can be exploited to inhibit chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical pain.</p>

miR-183 cluster scales mechanical pain sensitivity by regulating basal and neuropathic pain genes
<p>Nociception is protective and prevents tissue damage but can also facilitate chronic pain. Whether a general principle governs these two types of pain is unknown. Here, we show that both basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical and neuropathic pain are controlled by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster controls more than 80% of neuropathic pain–regulated genes and scales basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Basal sensitivity is controlled in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB<sup>+</sup> light-touch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>oreceptors. These light-touch–sensitive neurons, which normally do not elicit pain, produce pain during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical sensitivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic pain transduction in a specific, light-touch–sensitive neuronal type recruited during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical allodynia.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of ray-finned fishes: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular system (t-system) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-system in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-system at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical unloading.</p></sec>

Microtubules acquire resistance from mechanical breakage through intralumenal acetylation
<p>Eukaryotic cells rely on long-lived microtubules for intracellular transport and as compression-bearing elements. We considered that long-lived microtubules are acetylated inside their lumen and that microtubule acetylation may modify microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ics. Here, we found that tubulin acetylation is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical stabilization of long-lived microtubules in cells. Depletion of the tubulin acetyltransferase TAT1 led to a significant increase in the frequency of microtubule breakage.

In in vitro reconstitution experiments, acetylation was sufficient to protect microtubules from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical breakage.

Holographic description of a quantum black hole on a computer
<p>Black holes have been predicted to radiate particles and eventually evaporate, which has led to the information loss paradox and implies that the fundamental laws of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ics may be violated. Superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity, provides a possible solution to the paradox if evaporating black holes can actually be described in terms of standard quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical systems, as conjectured from the theory.

Carbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Photosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green alga that can grow using various carbon sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms to adapt to conditions where carbon supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the carbon availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the carbon-concentrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the carbon availability.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry.

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target effects through adenosine-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a loading dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream effectors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent antiplatelet effect (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an effect supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its antiplatelet efficacy, exerts cardioprotective effects by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms.</p></sec>

Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis of Arabidopsis Siliques Discloses Genes Essential for Fruit Development and Maturation
<p>Fruits protect the developing seeds of angiosperms and actively contribute to seed dispersion. Furthermore, fruit and seed development are highly synchronized and require exchange of information between the mother plant and the developing generations. To explore the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms controlling fruit formation and maturation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the valve tissue of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) silique using RNA sequencing. In doing so, we have generated a data set of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth and, subsequently, trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our data set has been tested by functional genomic studies. Using a reverse genetics approach, we selected 10 differentially expressed genes and explored the consequences of their disruption for both silique growth and senescence. We found that genes contained in our data set play essential roles in different stages of silique development and maturation, indicating that our transcriptome-based gene list is a powerful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for the elucidation of the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms controlling fruit formation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. Network modeling represents a powerful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use network modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge network (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble network inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different network modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative network modeling approach for unraveling molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Iron-Nicotianamine Transporters Are Required for Proper Long Distance Iron Signaling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of root iron uptake and the transcriptional networks that control root-level regulation of iron uptake have been well studied, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms by which shoots signal iron status to the roots remain opaque. Here, we characterize an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) double mutant, <i>yellow stripe1-like yellow stripe3-like</i> (<i>ysl1ysl3</i>), which has lost the ability to properly regulate iron deficiency-influenced gene expression in both roots and shoots. In spite of markedly low tissue levels of iron, the double mutant does not up- and down-regulate iron deficiency-induced and -repressed genes. We have used grafting experiments to show that wild-type roots grafted to <i>ysl1ysl3</i> shoots do not initiate iron deficiency-induced gene expression, indicating that the <i>ysl1ysl3</i> shoots fail to send an appropriate long-distance signal of shoot iron status to the roots. We present a model to explain how impaired iron localization in leaf veins results in incorrect signals of iron sufficiency being sent to roots and affecting gene expression there. Improved understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of long-distance iron signaling will allow improved strategies for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of staple crops to accumulate additional bioavailable iron in edible parts, thus improving the iron nutrition of the billions of people worldwide whose inadequate diet causes iron deficiency anemia.</p>

YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte’s response to damage
<p>Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration barrier. They are subjected to physiological filtration pressure and considerable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney diseases. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alterations of these cells, the filtration barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a rat model of glomerular disease before the development of proteinuria. Although the activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff substrates. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>otransduction-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix–related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target <i>CTGF</i> was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular disease patients. Although overexpression of human YAP in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between YAP and its partner TEAD in rats ameliorated glomerular disease and reduced damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>osignaling in the glomeruli. Thus, perturbation of YAP-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>osignaling is a potential therapeutic target for treating some glomerular diseases.</p>

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical environment through metabolic processes. By contrast, typical synthetic materials cannot grow and reconstruct their structures once formed.

This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical stamping.

Thyroid hormone signaling specifies cone subtypes in human retinal organoids
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.</p>

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from physical or chemical damage. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical damage. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals forces upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.</p>

CORNICHON sorting and regulation of GLR channels underlie pollen tube Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis

However, higher-order mutants of <i>At</i>GLR3.3 revealed phenotypes contradicting this assumption. These discrepancies could be explained by subcellular <i>At</i>GLR localization, and we explored the implication of <i>At</i>CNIHs in this sorting.

Piezo2 channel–Merkel cell signaling modulates the conversion of touch to itch

Making room for new memories
<p>What are our memories made of? Plato suggested imagining a block of wax in our soul, where perceptions and thoughts leave impressions that we can remember as long as they have not been erased. This historic metaphor captures the transience of some memories and the stability of others, and it illustrates the brain's plasticity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of memory formation and retention remain a key question in neuroscience. Groundbreaking work on the rodent hippocampus (a network in the temporal lobe) revealed that certain neurons form transiently stable representations of places (<i>1</i>). Hence, this brain region has become an important focus for studying spatial memory (or engram) formation. It also serves as an experimentally accessible proxy for declarative (knowledge) and episodic (experience) memory in humans, which involves the same brain structures and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms. However, how can we remember an almost infinite number of items with the limited storage capacity of the hippocampus? There is good evidence that relevant representations are transferred to neocortical networks before forming long-lasting engrams. The hippocampus is then reset for acquisition of new memories. Studies in animals (<i>2</i>) and humans (<i>3</i>) show that neuronal activity during sleep plays a major role in these processes. The underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms, however, have remained mostly enigmatic. On page 1524 of this issue, Norimoto <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how sleep-associated activity patterns induce “negative” neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, erasing remote memories. A previous, related paper by Khodagholy <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) reveals similar activity patterns in the neocortex, which, hence, may mediate long-term consolidation of transient engrams at their final location.</p>

DNA replication–coupled histone modification maintains Polycomb gene silencing in plants

We report carbon nanotube yarn harvesters that electrochemically convert tensile or torsional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical energy into electrical energy without requiring an external bias voltage. Stretching coiled yarns generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak electrical power when cycled up to 30 hertz, as well as up to 41.2 joules per kilogram of electrical energy per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical cycle, when normalized to harvester yarn weight. These energy harvesters were used in the ocean to harvest wave energy, combined with thermally driven artificial muscles to convert temperature fluctuations to electrical energy, sewn into textiles for use as self-powered respiration sensors, and used to power a light-emitting diode and to charge a storage capacitor.</p>

Circulating peptide prevents preeclampsia
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating complication of pregnancy that puts both mother and child at risk for clinical complications. In severe cases, PE can progress to multi-organ dysfunction and death. Characterized by hypertension (high blood pressure) and proteinuria (protein in the urine), the syndrome occurs in up to 8% of pregnancies. Although it is widely accepted that the pathophysiology of PE involves disturbance of normal blood vessel function in the placenta and the development and function of the placenta, the exact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms underlying PE have not been defined. Discovery of the causal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms in PE is urgently needed so that early assessment of risk and therapeutic interventions can be developed. On page 707 of this issue, Ho <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report breakthrough insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of PE.

Biased partitioning of the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC underlies long-lived phenotypic heterogeneity
<p>The molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms underlying phenotypic variation in isogenic bacterial populations remain poorly understood. We report that AcrAB-TolC, the main multidrug efflux pump of <i>Escherichia coli,</i> exhibits a strong partitioning bias for old cell poles by a segregation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism that is mediated by ternary AcrAB-TolC complex formation. Mother cells inheriting old poles are phenotypically distinct and display increased drug efflux activity relative to daughters. Consequently, we find systematic and long-lived growth differences between mother and daughter cells in the presence of subinhibitory drug concentrations. A simple model for biased partitioning predicts a population structure of long-lived and highly heterogeneous phenotypes. This straightforward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of generating sustained growth rate differences at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations has implications for understanding the emergence of multidrug resistance in bacteria.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism by which plants integrate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms by which plants integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect plant gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on plant leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land plant groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest plant group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular plants, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land plant stomatal responses.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>istically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical properties, to add <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>istic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation growth by increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical wall loosening.</p>

Carotenogenesis Is Regulated by 5′UTR-Mediated Translation of Phytoene Synthase Splice Variants
<p>Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the highly regulated, frequently rate-limiting synthesis of the first biosynthetically formed carotene. While <i>PSY</i> constitutes a small gene family in most plant taxa, the Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), predominantly possess a single <i>PSY</i> gene. This monogenic situation is compensated by the differential expression of two alternative splice variants (ASV), which differ in length and in the exon/intron retention of their 5′UTRs. ASV1 contains a long 5′UTR (untranslated region) and is involved in developmentally regulated carotenoid formation, such as during deetiolation. ASV2 contains a short 5′UTR and is preferentially induced when an immediate increase in the carotenoid pathway flux is required, such as under salt stress or upon sudden light intensity changes. We show that the long 5′UTR of ASV1 is capable of attenuating the translational activity in response to high carotenoid pathway fluxes. This function resides in a defined 5′UTR stretch with two predicted interconvertible RNA conformations, as known from riboswitches, which might act as a flux sensor. The translation-inhibitory structure is absent from the short 5′UTR of ASV2 allowing to bypass translational inhibition under conditions requiring rapidly increased pathway fluxes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism is not found in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>PSY1</i> 5′UTR, consistent with the prevalence of transcriptional control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms in taxa with multiple <i>PSY</i> genes. The translational control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism identified is interpreted in terms of flux adjustments needed in response to retrograde signals stemming from intermediates of the plastid-localized carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in addition to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In addition, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Altered lipid homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i> InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants leads to obesity and hyperphagia
<p>Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder that often manifests with a strong genetic component in humans. However, the genetic basis for obesity and the accompanying metabolic syndrome is poorly defined. At a metabolic level, obesity arises from an imbalance between the nutritional intake and energy utilization of an organism. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms that sense the metabolic state of the individual and convey this information to satiety centers help achieve this balance. Mutations in genes that alter or modify such signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms are likely to lead to either obese individuals, who in mammals are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or excessively thin individuals with accompanying health problems. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> mutants for an intracellular calcium signaling channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) store excess triglycerides in their fat bodies and become unnaturally obese on a normal diet. Although excess insulin signaling can rescue obesity in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants to some extent, we show that it is not the only cause of the defect. Through mass spectrometric analysis of lipids we find that homeostasis of storage and membrane lipids are altered in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants. Possibly as a compensatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism, InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutant adults also feed excessively. Thus, reduced InsP<sub>3</sub>R function alters lipid metabolism and causes hyperphagia in adults. Together, the metabolic and behavioral changes lead to obesity. Our results implicate altered InsP<sub>3</sub> signaling as a previously unknown causative factor for metabolic syndrome in humans. Importantly, our studies also suggest preventive dietary interventions.</p>

Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex neuronal and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to rodents. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor neuron loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in neurons and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor neurons, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor neurons, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor neurons versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore sleep as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of sleep fragmentation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor neurons and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms, which will be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately patterned tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage potential gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms that regulate pattern formation. We tested the role of transmembrane potential in tumorigenesis mediated by canonical oncogenes in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Depolarized membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>) was a characteristic of induced tumor-like structures (ITLSs) generated by overexpression of <i>Gli1</i>, <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i>, <i>Xrel3</i> or <i>p53<sup>Trp248</sup></i>. This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor ITLS sites. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a bioelectric marker that reveals ITLSs before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to normal <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> and significantly reduced ITLS formation <i>in vivo</i>. To characterize the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism by which <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> change regulates ITLS phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>-regulated activity of SLC5A8, a sodium-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of ITLSs by hyperpolarization. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a convenient cellular parameter by which tumors induced by human oncogenes can be detected <i>in vivo</i> and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane potential is functionally involved in the process by which oncogene-bearing cells depart from normal morphogenesis programs to form tumors. Modulation of <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> levels is a novel and promising strategy for tumor normalization.</p>

Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms related to the improvements in electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

CD73 on T Cells Orchestrates Cardiac Wound Healing After Myocardial Infarction by Purinergic Metabolic Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>T cells are required for proper healing after myocardial infarction. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of their beneficial action, however, is unknown. The proinflammatory danger signal ATP, released from damaged cells, is degraded by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. Here, we investigate the contribution of CD73-derived adenosine produced by T cells to cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion and define its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Myocardial ischemia (50 minutes followed by reperfusion) was induced in global CD73<sup>−/−</sup> and CD4-CD73<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice. Tissue injury, T-cell purinergic signaling, cytokines, and cardiac function (magnetic resonance tomography at 9.4 T over 4 weeks) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Changes in functional parameters of CD4-CD73<sup>−/−</sup> mice were identical to those in global CD73 knockouts (KOs). T cells infiltrating the injured heart significantly upregulated at the gene (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein (enzymatic activity) levels critical transporters and enzymes (connexin43, connexin37, pannexin-1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, CD39, CD73, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3, CD157, CD38) for the accelerated release and hydrolysis of ATP, cAMP, AMP, and NAD to adenosine. It is surprising that a lack of CD39 on T cells (from CD39<sup>−/−</sup> mice) did not alter ATP hydrolysis and very likely involves pyrophosphatases (ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3). Circulating T cells predominantly expressed A<sub>2a</sub> receptor (A<sub>2a</sub>R) transcripts. After myocardial infarction, A<sub>2b</sub> receptor (A<sub>2b</sub>R) transcription was induced in both T cells and myeloid cells in the heart. Thus, A<sub>2a</sub>R and A<sub>2b</sub>R signaling may contribute to myocardial responses after myocardial infarction. In the case of T cells, this was associated with an accelerated secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines (interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and interleukin-17) when CD73 was lacking. Cytokine production by T cells from peripheral lymph nodes was inhibited by A<sub>2a</sub>R activation (CGS-21680). The A<sub>2b</sub>R agonist BAY 60-6583 showed off-target effects. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA inhibited interferon-γ and stimulated interleukin-6 production, each of which was antagonized by a specific A<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist (PSB-603).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work demonstrates that CD73 on T cells plays a crucial role in the cardiac wound healing process after myocardial infarction. The underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism involves a profound increase in the hydrolysis of ATP/NAD and AMP, resulting primarily from the upregulation of pyrophosphatases and CD73. We also define A<sub>2b</sub>R/A<sub>2a</sub>R–mediated autacoid feedback inhibition of proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines by T cell–derived CD73.</p></sec>

Identification of MicroRNA-124 as a Major Regulator of Enhanced Endothelial Cell Glycolysis in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension via PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein) and Pyruvate Kinase M2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by abnormal growth and enhanced glycolysis of pulmonary artery endothelial cells. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms underlying alterations in energy production have not been identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we examined the miRNA and proteomic profiles of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from patients with heritable PAH caused by mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) gene and patients with idiopathic PAH to determine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms underlying abnormal endothelial glycolysis. We hypothesized that in BOECs from patients with PAH, the downregulation of microRNA-124 (miR-124), determined with a tiered systems biology approach, is responsible for increased expression of the splicing factor <i>PTBP1</i> (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), resulting in alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms 1 and 2 (PKM1 and 2) and consequently increased PKM2 expression. We questioned whether this alternative regulation plays a critical role in the hyperglycolytic phenotype of PAH endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Heritable PAH and idiopathic PAH BOECs recapitulated the metabolic abnormalities observed in pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with idiopathic PAH, confirming a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Overexpression of miR-124 or siRNA silencing of <i>PTPB1</i> restored normal proliferation and glycolysis in heritable PAH BOECs, corrected the dysregulation of glycolytic genes and lactate production, and partially restored mitochondrial respiration. <i>BMPR2</i> knockdown in control BOECs reduced the expression of miR-124, increased <i>PTPB1</i>, and enhanced glycolysis. Moreover, we observed reduced miR-124, increased <i>PTPB1</i> and <i>PKM2</i> expression, and significant dysregulation of glycolytic genes in the rat SUGEN-hypoxia model of severe PAH, characterized by reduced <i>BMPR2</i> expression and endothelial hyperproliferation, supporting the relevance of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>ism in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pulmonary vascular and circulating progenitor endothelial cells isolated from patients with PAH demonstrate downregulation of miR-124, leading to the metabolic and proliferative abnormalities in PAH ECs via PTPB1 and PKM1/PKM2. Therefore, the manipulation of this miRNA or its targets could represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of PAH.</p></sec>

Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying fetuses with heart defects and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms are involved in the pathogenesis of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter. We conducted a register-based cohort study to determine whether offspring congenital heart defects are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms driving any association are primarily maternal or fetal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among singleton pregnancies without chromosomal abnormalities lasting ≥20 weeks in Denmark from 1978 to 2011 (n= 1 972 857), we identified pregnancies complicated by offspring congenital heart defects or early preterm preeclampsia, late preterm preeclampsia, term preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between offspring congenital heart defects and maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall and for specific heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Offspring congenital heart defects were strongly associated with early preterm preeclampsia (OR, 7.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.11–8.03) and late preterm preeclampsia (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.38–3.34) in the same pregnancy and weakly associated with term preeclampsia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27), but they were not associated with gestational hypertension (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25). Association strengths were consistent across heart defect types. Offspring congenital heart defects in a previous pregnancy were also strongly associated with preterm preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.34; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52–2.75) but were only modestly associated with term preeclampsia and not associated with gestational hypertension. Similarly, preterm preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, but not term preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, was associated with offspring congenital heart defects in later pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 6.06–10.3; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.11–3.79; term preeclampsia: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10; gestational hypertension: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92–1.38).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Linked pathophysiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mechan</span></strong></span></strong>isms may be involved in some congenital heart defects and preterm preeclampsia. The strong associations across pregnancies support a predominantly maternal origin of effect.</p></sec>

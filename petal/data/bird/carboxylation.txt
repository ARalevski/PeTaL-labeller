An algal photoenzyme converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons
<p>Although many organisms capture or respond to sunlight, few enzymes are known to be driven by light. Among these are DNA photolyases and the photosynthetic reaction centers. Here, we show that the microalga <i>Chlorella variabilis</i> NC64A harbors a photoenzyme that acts in lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to an algae-specific clade of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and catalyzes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decarboxyl</span></strong>ation of free fatty acids to n-alkanes or -alkenes in response to blue light. Crystal structure of the protein reveals a fatty acid–binding site in a hydrophobic tunnel leading to the light-capturing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decarboxyl</span></strong>ation is initiated through electron abstraction from the fatty acid by the photoexcited FAD with a quantum yield >80%. This photoenzyme, which we name fatty acid photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decarboxyl</span></strong>ase, may be useful in light-driven, bio-based production of hydrocarbons.</p>

Discovery and inhibition of an interspecies gut bacterial pathway for Levodopa metabolism
<p>The human gut microbiota metabolizes the Parkinson’s disease medication Levodopa (<sc>l</sc>-dopa), potentially reducing drug availability and causing side effects. However, the organisms, genes, and enzymes responsible for this activity in patients and their susceptibility to inhibition by host-targeted drugs are unknown. Here, we describe an interspecies pathway for gut bacterial <sc>l</sc>-dopa metabolism. Conversion of <sc>l</sc>-dopa to dopamine by a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent tyrosine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decarboxyl</span></strong>ase from <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is followed by transformation of dopamine to <i>m</i>-tyramine by a molybdenum-dependent dehydroxylase from <i>Eggerthella lenta</i>. These enzymes predict drug metabolism in complex human gut microbiotas. Although a drug that targets host aromatic amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decarboxyl</span></strong>ase does not prevent gut microbial <sc>l</sc>-dopa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decarboxyl</span></strong>ation, we identified a compound that inhibits this activity in Parkinson’s patient microbiotas and increases <sc>l</sc>-dopa bioavailability in mice.</p>

Photocatalytic decarboxylative alkylations mediated by triphenylphosphine and sodium iodide
<p>Most photoredox catalysts in current use are precious metal complexes or synthetically elaborate organic dyes, the cost of which can impede their application for large-scale industrial processes. We found that a combination of triphenylphosphine and sodium iodide under 456-nanometer irradiation by blue light–emitting diodes can catalyze the alkylation of silyl enol ethers by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decarboxyl</span></strong>ative coupling with redox-active esters in the absence of transition metals. Deaminative alkylation using Katritzky’s N-alkylpyridinium salts and trifluoromethylation using Togni’s reagent are also demonstrated. Moreover, the phosphine/iodide-based photoredox system catalyzes Minisci-type alkylation of N-heterocycles and can operate in tandem with chiral phosphoric acids to achieve high enantioselectivity in this reaction.</p>

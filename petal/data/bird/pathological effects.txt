Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006).

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on endothelial cell migration and tube formation.

Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in both models without inducing negative side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

Nocebo effects can make you feel pain
<p>The mysterious phenomenon known as the nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> describes negative expectancies. This is in contrast to positive expectancies that trigger placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (<i>1</i>). In evolutionary terms, nocebo and placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s coexist to favor perceptual mechanisms that anticipate threat and dangerous events (nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s) and promote appetitive and safety behaviors (placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s). In randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, patients that receive placebos often report side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (nocebos) that are similar to those experienced by patients that receive the investigational treatment (<i>2</i>). Information provided during the informed consent process and divulgence of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s contribute to nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in clinical trials (<i>1</i>). Nocebo (and placebo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s engage a complex set of neural circuits in the central nervous system that modulate the perception of touch, pressure, pain, and temperature (<i>1</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Commercial features of drugs such as price and labeling influence placebos (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). On page 105 of this issue, Tinnermann <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) show that price also influences nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p>

Integrated view of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> in the Americas
<p>Latin America has experienced two of the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholera</span></strong> epidemics in modern history; one in 1991 and the other in 2010. However, confusion still surrounds the relationships between globally circulating pandemic <i>Vibrio <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholera</span></strong>e</i> clones and local bacterial populations. We used whole-genome sequencing to characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholera</span></strong> across the Americas over a 40-year time span. We found that both epidemics were the result of intercontinental introductions of seventh pandemic El Tor <i>V. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholera</span></strong>e</i> and that at least seven lineages local to the Americas are associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e that differs epidemiologically from epidemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholera</span></strong>. Our results consolidate historical accounts of pandemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholera</span></strong> with data to show the importance of local lineages, presenting an integrated view of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cholera</span></strong> that is important to the design of future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e control strategies.</p>

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in utero are also discussed.

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>or-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e caused by all four isolates, but their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>or-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

Causal Associations of Adiposity and Body Fat Distribution With Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke Subtypes, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The implications of different adiposity measures on cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e etiology remain unclear. In this article, we quantify and contrast causal associations of central adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index [WHRadjBMI]) and general adiposity (body mass index [BMI]) with cardiometabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ninety-seven independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms for BMI and 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for WHRadjBMI were used to conduct Mendelian randomization analyses in 14 prospective studies supplemented with coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (CHD) data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary Artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e [C4D] Genetics; combined total 66 842 cases), stroke from METASTROKE (12 389 ischemic stroke cases), type 2 diabetes mellitus from DIAGRAM (Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis; 34 840 cases), and lipids from GLGC (Global Lipids Genetic Consortium; 213 500 participants) consortia.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis

We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive than no AP for all patients at risk of IE.

AP was even more cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year.

Effect of Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs on Blood Pressure

Studies were included if they applied a diet or physical activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were calculated for systolic BP and diastolic BP with the use of weighted random-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on diastolic BP.

Transcriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder
<p>Most genetic risk for psychiatric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing. However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed brains are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e loci likely mediated by cis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development.</p>

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that expand in cancer, inflammation, and infection and negatively regulate inflammation and the immune response. Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein inflammation induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload–induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of MDSCs on isoproterenol- or TAC-induced HF were observed on depleting MDSCs with 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), transferring purified MDSCs, or enhancing endogenous MDSCs with rapamycin (2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). Hypertrophic markers and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The percentage of human leukocyte antigen-D–related (HLA-DR)<sup>−</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the blood of patients with HF was significantly increased and positively correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e severity and increased plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor–β. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of interleukin-10 blunted both monocytic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC–mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of monocytic MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s through interleukin-10 and nitric oxide.

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its target genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Furthermore, normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s models in 2 population-based cohorts.

To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

Potent Thrombolytic Effect of <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine on Arterial Thrombi
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelet cross-linking during arterial thrombosis involves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. Therefore, proteolysis of VWF appears promising to disaggregate platelet-rich thrombi and restore vessel patency in acute thrombotic disorders such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or acute limb ischemia. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a clinically approved mucolytic drug) can reduce intrachain disulfide bonds in large polymeric proteins. In the present study, we postulated that NAC might cleave the VWF multimers inside occlusive thrombi, thereby leading to their dissolution and arterial recanalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental models of thrombotic stroke induced by either intra-arterial thrombin injection or ferric chloride application followed by measurement of cerebral blood flow using a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and MRI were performed to uncover the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC on arterial thrombi. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC on larger vessels, we also performed ferric chloride–induced carotid artery thrombosis. In vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular bases of NAC thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, including platelet aggregometry, platelet-rich thrombi lysis assays, thromboelastography (ROTEM), and high-shear VWF string formation using microfluidic devices. We also investigated the putative prohemorrhagic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage induced by in situ collagenase type VII injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated that intravenous NAC administration promotes lysis of arterial thrombi that are resistant to conventional approaches such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, direct thrombin inhibitors, and antiplatelet treatments. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the molecular target underlying the thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC is principally the VWF that cross-link platelets in arterial thrombi. Coadministration of NAC and a nonpeptidic GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor further improved its thrombolytic efficacy, essentially by accelerating thrombus dissolution and preventing rethrombosis. Thus, in a new large-vessel thromboembolic stroke model in mice, this cotreatment significantly improved ischemic lesion size and neurological outcome.

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of a high-fiber diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-fiber diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of fiber modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both fiber and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-fiber diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of high fiber and acetate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal <i>Egr1</i>, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A diet high in fiber led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with new techniques and devices. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel devices such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive devices to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Until then, we must identify the most cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient.

Phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein by mutant LRRK2 promotes AICD activity and neurotoxicity in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mutations in <i>LRRK2</i>, which encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are the most common genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (PD), a degenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of the central nervous system that causes impaired motor function and, in advanced stages, dementia. Dementia is a common symptom of another neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, Alzheimer’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and research suggests that there may be pathophysiological and genetic links between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Aggregates of β amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)] are seen in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es and in PD patients carrying G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain tissue, and PD model mice, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and phosphorylated APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> within its intracellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with increased nuclear abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in cultures and brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Overexpression of AICD, but not a phosphodeficient mutant (AICD<sup>T668A</sup>), increased the loss of dopaminergic neurons in older mice expressing LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup>. Moreover, the amount of Thr<sup>668</sup>-phosphorylated APP was substantially greater in postmortem brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons (generated by reprogramming skin cells) from LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> in the patient-derived dopaminergic neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> mice. Thus, APP is a substrate of LRRK2, and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and neurotoxicity in PD.</p>

Understanding Lassa fever
<p>Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in West Africa that has been gaining international attention as an emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with the potential to cause epidemics (<i>1</i>). Confirmed and suspected cases of Lassa fever have been steadily rising in Nigeria over the past 3 years. Laboratory-confirmed cases have increased from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and had already reached 562 by November 2018 (<i>2</i>). Part of defining the scope of the problem is trying to assess whether this is a true increase in the number of people afflicted by the infection, due to either changes in the virus itself or the geographical spread of the vector (rodents of the <i>Mastomys</i> spp.), or a reflection of higher rates of detection and diagnosis secondary to the increased attention and interest of clinicians and laboratorians (<i>1</i>). Lassa fever outbreaks illustrate the issues associated with the response and management of emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es: How do you plan the public health, clinical, and community responses to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e while you are still learning about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and the ecological factors contributing to the spread of the pathogen? On page 74 of this issue, Kafetzopoulou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present the results of a rapid genomic study of Lassa virus (LASV) from the cases of 2018, which have improved understanding of how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has been spreading in Nigeria and have led to informed and targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-control strategies. The study also further describes the use of a new and compact genomic sequencing device, which may start playing a larger role in defining other emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e outbreaks in real time.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop drug resistance has contributed to the continuing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. A global effort to develop new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the drug development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the brain that are believed to be associated with pathogenesis—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using immunological or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e course. In addition, treating brain inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has shown limited or no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the immune system, including the resident brain myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal.

Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After adjustment for demographics, PAD risk factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This risk was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13). In contrast, HIV+ veterans with time updated CD4 cell count ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had no increased risk of PAD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11). Mortality rates after incident PAD events are high regardless of HIV status. HIV infection did not affect rates of amputation after incident PAD events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Infection with HIV is associated with a 19% increased risk of PAD beyond that explained by traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. However, for those with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, the risk of incident PAD events is nearly 2-fold higher whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> there is no excess risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected people.</p></sec>

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac biology and mechanisms driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA amplification strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury. Clustering analysis based on differential gene expression unveiled known and novel markers of all main cardiac cell types. Based on differential gene expression, we could identify multiple subpopulations within a certain cell type. Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor β triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac cells, as well as cell type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. This new approach provides a wealth of novel insights into molecular changes that underlie the cellular processes relevant for cardiac biology and pathophysiology.

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of intense fibrosis. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis.

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. We define key inflammatory molecules that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhesion molecule–1.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Policy Model to estimate the cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear. Here, we identified that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26) increases valvular calcification and promotes calcific aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We obtained the aortic valve tissues from humans and murine models (wild-type and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice) and cultured the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and valvular endothelial cells from the cusps. We induced osteogenic differentiation in the primary cultured VICs and examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the DPP-4 inhibitor on the osteogenic changes in vitro and aortic valve calcification in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice. We also induced calcific aortic stenosis in male New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) by a cholesterol-enriched diet+vitamin D2 (25 000 IU, daily). Echocardiography was performed to assess the aortic valve area and the maximal and mean transaortic pressure gradients at baseline and 3-week intervals thereafter. After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric oxide depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs. Consequently, the NF-κB promotes DPP-4 expression, which then induces the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. The inhibition of DPP-4 enzymatic activity blocked the osteogenic changes in VICs in vitro and reduced the aortic valve calcification in vivo in a mouse model. Sitagliptin administration in a rabbit calcific aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e model led to significant improvements in the rate of change in aortic valve area, transaortic peak velocity, and maximal and mean pressure gradients over 12 weeks. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of Sitagliptin in terms of reducing the calcium deposits in the rabbit aortic valve cusps. In rabbits receiving Sitagliptin, the plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 levels were significantly increased, in line with DPP-4 inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DPP-4-dependent insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibition in VICs contributes to aortic valve calcification, suggesting that DPP-4 could serve as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit calcific aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression.</p></sec>

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways. These events can reverse hindlimb ischemia in mice for >24 hours and increase muscle blood flow in patients with sickle cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Clinical Outcomes in 3343 Children and Adults With Rheumatic Heart Disease From 14 Low- and Middle-Income Countries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are few contemporary data on the mortality and morbidity associated with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e or information on their predictors. We report the 2-year follow-up of individuals with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e from 14 low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2010 and November 2012, we enrolled 3343 patients from 25 centers in 14 countries and followed them for 2 years to assess mortality, congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, recurrent acute rheumatic fever, and infective endocarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Vital status at 24 months was known for 2960 (88.5%) patients. Two-thirds were female. Although patients were young (median age, 28 years; interquartile range, 18–40), the 2-year case fatality rate was high (500 deaths, 16.9%). Mortality rate was 116.3/1000 patient-years in the first year and 65.4/1000 patient-years in the second year. Median age at death was 28.7 years. Independent predictors of death were severe valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80–3.11), congestive heart failure (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.70–2.72), New York Heart Association functional class III/IV (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.32–2.10), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10–1.78), and older age (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02 per year increase) at enrollment. Postprimary education (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85) and female sex (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52–0.80) were associated with lower risk of death. Two hundred and four (6.9%) patients had new congestive heart failure (incidence, 38.42/1000 patient-years), 46 (1.6%) had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (8.45/1000 patient-years), 19 (0.6%) had recurrent acute rheumatic fever (3.49/1000 patient-years), and 20 (0.7%) had infective endocarditis (3.65/1000 patient-years). Previous stroke and older age were independent predictors of stroke/transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism. Patients from low- and lower-middle–income countries had significantly higher age- and sex-adjusted mortality than patients from upper-middle–income countries. Valve surgery was significantly more common in upper-middle–income than in lower-middle– or low-income countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with clinical rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e have high mortality and morbidity despite being young; those from low- and lower-middle–income countries had a poorer prognosis associated with advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and low education. Programs focused on early detection and the treatment of clinical rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e are required to improve outcomes.</p></sec>

Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential risk reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended risk factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. The risk score was externally validated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated risk for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART risk score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of risk in patients with 10-year risk >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, median 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year risk would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year risk <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year risk, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Existence, Functional Impairment, and Lung Repair Potential of Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells in Oxygen-Induced Arrested Alveolar Growth
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Human fetal and neonatal rat lungs contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal lung ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth–arrested rat lungs mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human cord blood–derived ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored lung function, alveolar and lung vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. Lung ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored. Low ECFC engraftment and the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of cell-free ECFC-derived conditioned media suggest a paracrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>. Long-term (10 months) assessment of ECFC therapy showed no adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s with persistent improvement in lung structure, exercise capacity, and pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Impaired ECFC function may contribute to arrested alveolar growth.

Genetic studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and humans support a model for the concerted function of <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> in disease
<p>Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a progressive neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. WFS1 and WFS2 are caused by recessive mutations in the genes <i>Wolfram Syndrome 1</i> (<i>WFS1</i>) and <i>CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2</i> (<i>CISD2</i>), respectively. To explore the function of <i>CISD2</i>, we performed genetic studies in flies with altered expression of its <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue, <i>cisd2</i>. Surprisingly, flies with strong ubiquitous RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>cisd2</i> had no obvious signs of altered life span, stress resistance, locomotor behavior or several other phenotypes. We subsequently found in a targeted genetic screen, however, that altered function of <i>cisd2</i> modified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of overexpressing the fly orthologues of two lysosomal storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e genes, <i>palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1</i> (<i>PPT1</i> in humans, <i>Ppt1</i> in flies) and <i>ceroid-lipofuscinosis</i>, <i>neuronal 3</i> (<i>CLN3</i> in humans, <i>cln3</i> in flies), on eye morphology in flies. We also found that <i>cln3</i> modified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of overexpressing <i>Ppt1</i> in the eye and that overexpression of <i>cln3</i> interacted with a loss of function mutation in <i>cisd2</i> to disrupt locomotor ability in flies. Follow-up multi-species bioinformatic analyses suggested that a gene network centered on <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e through altered carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding and endopeptidase activity. Human genetic studies indicated that copy number variants (duplications and deletions) including <i>CLN3</i>, and possibly another gene in the <i>CISD2/PPT1/CLN3</i> network, are over-represented in individuals with developmental delay. Our studies indicate that <i>cisd2</i>, <i>Ppt1</i> and <i>cln3</i> function in concert in flies, suggesting that <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might also function coordinately in humans. Further, our studies raise the possibility that WFS2 and some lysosomal storage disorders might be influenced by common mechanisms and that the underlying genes might have previously unappreciated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on developmental delay.</p>

Novel Adipokine, FAM19A5, Inhibits Neointima Formation After Injury Through Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family. We aimed to test whether adipose-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular pathology on injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>DNA cloning, protein expression, purification, and N-terminal sequencing were applied to characterize FAM19A5. Adenovirus infection and siRNA transfection were performed to regulate FAM19A5 expression. Balloon and wire injury were performed in vivo on the rat carotid arteries and mouse femoral arteries, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, radioactive ligand-receptor binding assays, receptor internalization, and calcium mobilization assays were used to identify the functional receptor for FAM19A5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first characterized FAM19A5 as a secreted protein, and the first 43 N-terminal amino acids were the signal peptides. Both FAM19A5 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue but were downregulated in obese mice. Overexpression of FAM19A5 markedly inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and neointima formation in the carotid arteries of balloon-injured rats. Accordingly, FAM19A5 silencing in adipocytes significantly promoted vascular smooth muscle cell activation. Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic mice showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet. We further revealed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 was the functional receptor for FAM19A5, with a dissociation constant (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of 0.634 nmol/L. Inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 or its downstream G12/13-RhoA signaling circumvented the suppressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of FAM19A5 on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We revealed that a novel adipokine, FAM19A5, was capable of inhibiting postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling. Downregulation of FAM19A5 during obesity may trigger cardiometabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-cell responses. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in comparison with controls without coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor–producing B cells within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-cell depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune cell activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is 1 of the major causes of maternal mortality. We studied pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatic mitral valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Registry of Pregnancy and Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is an international prospective registry, and consecutive pregnant women with cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e were included. Pregnancy outcomes in all women with rheumatic mitral valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and no prepregnancy valve replacement is described in the present study (n=390). A maternal cardiac event was defined as cardiac death, arrhythmia requiring treatment, heart failure, thromboembolic event, aortic dissection, endocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for other cardiac reasons or cardiac intervention. Associations between patient characteristics and cardiac outcomes were checked in a 3-level model (patient–center–country).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most patients came from emerging countries (75%). Mitral stenosis (MS) with or without mitral regurgitation (MR) was present in 273 women, isolated MR in 117. The degree of MS was mild in 20.9%, moderate in 39.2%, severe in 19.8%, and severity not classified in the remainder. Maternal death during pregnancy occurred in 1 patient with severe MS. Hospital admission occurred in 23.1% of the women with MS, and the main reason was heart failure (mild MS 15.8%, moderate 23.4%, severe 48.1%; <i>P</i><0.001). Heart failure occurred in 23.1% of patients with moderate or severe MR. An intervention during pregnancy was performed in 16 patients, 14 had percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy, and 2 had surgical valve replacement (1 for MS, 1 for MR). In multivariable modeling, prepregnancy New York Heart Association class >1 was an independent predictor of maternal cardiac events. Follow-up at 6 months postpartum was available for 53%, and 3 more patients died (1 with severe MS, 1 with moderate MS, 1 with moderate to severe MR).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although mortality was only 1.9% during pregnancy, ≈50% of the patients with severe rheumatic MS and 23% of those with significant MR developed heart failure during pregnancy. Prepregnancy counseling and considering mitral valve interventions in selected patients are important to prevent these complications.</p></sec>

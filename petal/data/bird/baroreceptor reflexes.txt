PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex
<p>Activation of stretch-sensitive baroreceptor neurons exerts acute control over heart rate and blood pressure. Although this homeostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> has been described for more than 80 years, the molecular identity of baroreceptor mechanosensitivity remains unknown. We discovered that mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are together required for baroreception. Genetic ablation of both <i>Piezo1</i> and <i>Piezo2</i> in the nodose and petrosal sensory ganglia of mice abolished drug-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> and aortic depressor nerve activity. Awake, behaving animals that lack <i>Piezos</i> had labile hypertension and increased blood pressure variability, consistent with phenotypes in baroreceptor-denervated animals and humans with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> failure. Optogenetic activation of <i>Piezo2</i>-positive sensory afferents was sufficient to initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> in mice. These findings suggest that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are the long-sought baroreceptor mechanosensors critical for acute blood pressure control.</p>

Baroreflex regulation affects ventilation in the cururu toad <i>R</i><i>hinella schneideri</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Anurans integrate multiple mechanisms to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis; influences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> on lung ventilation in the toad <i>Rhinella schneideri</i> correlate with function of the lymphatic system.</p>

Cardiac reflexes in a warming world: thermal plasticity of barostatic control and autonomic tones in a temperate fish
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Perch from a chronically warmed ecosystem exhibit profound thermal compensation of resting heart rate through increased cholinergic tone and heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> sensitivity; the latter may safeguard tissue perfusion pressure when tissue oxygen demand is elevated by environmental warming.</p>

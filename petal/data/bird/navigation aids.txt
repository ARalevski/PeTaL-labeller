Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid genome structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in genetics and genomics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the genome structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A genome diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B genome diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB genome tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic linkage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A genome; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B genome; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB genome. The resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s plus 13 published <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s were integrated into a consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> covering 2651 cM with 3693 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>ker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B genomes. The comparative genomics with genome sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> genome has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s, and genome-specific diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s will increase the genetic and genomic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by pri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>y angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong> was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong> values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong> and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>kers and saturated genetic linkage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> has been limited in foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail millet genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>kers were physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. About 159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>kers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across millet and non-millet species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy grasses (∼79%, Switchgrass and ∼93%, Pearl millet) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy grasses. <i>In silico</i> comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of 15 573 foxtail millet microsatellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>kers against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and target species. The results, thus, demonstrate the immense applicability of developed microsatellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>kers in germplasm characterization, phylogenetics, construction of genetic linkage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> for gene/quantitative trait loci discovery, comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping in foxtail millet, including other millets and bioenergy grass species.</p>

Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation
<p>Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting conservation plans to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate forest canopy functional trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern explained by geology, topography, hydrology, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of forest beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53% of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped, functionally distinct forest presents an opportunity for new conservation action. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change.</p>

‘Ending AIDS’ movement falters worldwide
<p>A campaign to end AIDS by 2030, led by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), is badly off track. This became abundantly clear at the International AIDS Conference held in Amsterdam last week. The campaign rests on a mathematical model that says that treatment levels are high enough, the epidemic will peter out because people who fully suppress their virus rarely infect others. Although 21.7 million of the 36.9 million HIV-infected people in the world now receive antiretrovirals, too few countries have met treatment targets. Indeed, nearly 2 million people became infected last year, and to meet UNAIDS bench<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>ks for ending AIDS, that number would have to drop to 500,000 by 2020, which now seems highly unlikely. But there was good news at the conference, too: The few countries that have met the targets, including Namibia and Botswana, have seen big drops in new infections, as the mathematical model predicted. And one study hammered in the point that effective treatment essentially eliminates the risk of an infected person transmitting the virus to others.</p>

Global drainage patterns and the origins of topographic relief on Earth, Mars, and Titan
<p>Rivers have eroded the topography of Mars, Titan, and Earth, creating diverse landscapes. However, the dominant processes that generated topography on Titan (and to some extent on early Mars) are not well known. We analyzed drainage patterns on all three bodies and found that large drainages, which record interactions between deformation and erosional modification, conform much better to long-wavelength topography on Titan and Mars than on Earth. We use a numerical landscape evolution model to demonstrate that short-wavelength deformation causes drainage directions to diverge from long-wavelength topography, as observed on Earth. We attribute the observed differences to ancient long-wavelength topography on Mars, recent or ongoing generation of long-wavelength relief on Titan, and the creation of short-wavelength relief by plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

Bug mapping and fitness testing of chemically synthesized chromosome X
<p>Debugging a genome sequence is imperative for successfully building a synthetic genome. As part of the effort to build a designer eukaryotic genome, yeast synthetic chromosome X (synX), designed as 707,459 base pairs, was synthesized chemically. SynX exhibited good fitness under a wide variety of conditions.

The aftermath of AIDS in China
<p>By the mid-1990s, the terror of the early AIDS epidemic had subsided in many western countries, as antiretroviral therapy transformed the once-deadly disease into a chronic condition. In China, however, the AIDS epidemic was just getting started. Slipping across the nation's southern borders via injection drug use, the virus went largely undetected until it exploded among tens of thousands of plasma sellers in rural China. HIV/AIDS in China: Beyond the Numbers is a candid account of how the AIDS epidemic forced Chinese leaders into action.</p>

A SIMPLE Pipeline for Mapping Point Mutations
<p>A forward genetic screen is one of the best methods for revealing the function of genes. In plants, this technique is highly efficient, as it is relatively easy to grow and screen hundreds or thousands of individuals.

Embryonic neural activity wires the brain
<p>The development of many sensory systems commonly involves patterned spontaneous activity of neurons, in which nearby neurons fire synchronously, forming waves of activity that propagate throughout a neural circuit. In concert with sensory experience and molecular factors, patterned spontaneous activity is critical for the formation of sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s, which are spatial representations in the brain of the sensory features they encode. The initial establishment of sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s is thought to be driven by molecular cues and later refined by neural activity, initially through patterned spontaneous activity and later by sensory-evoked activity. On page 987 of this issue, Antón-Bolaños <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the mouse whisker system to show that at the earliest stages of innervation to the cortex during brain development, patterned spontaneous activity is required for the formation of functional sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s.</p>

Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state
<p>On multimillion-year time scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weather</span></strong>ing. To better constrain global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weather</span></strong>ability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets.

Mars’ atmospheric history derived from upper-atmosphere measurements of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
<p>The history of Mars’ atmosphere is important for understanding the geological evolution and potential habitability of the planet. We determine the amount of gas lost to space through time using measurements of the upper-atmospheric structure made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to space by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the atmospheric argon has been lost to space. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ atmospheric gas has been lost to space, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet environment to today’s cold, dry atmosphere.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

For instance, MPK4 functions in regulating development as well as in plant defense by participating in two independent MAP kinase cascades: the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade promotes basal resistance against pathogens and is guarded by the NB-LRR protein SUMM2, whereas the ANPs-MKK6-MPK4 cascade plays an essential role in cytokinesis. Here, we report a novel role for MKK6 in regulating plant immune responses. We found that MKK6 functions similarly to MKK1/MKK2 and works together with MEKK1 and MPK4 to prevent autoactivation of SUMM2-mediated defense responses. Interestingly, loss of MKK6 or ANP2/ANP3 results in constitutive activation of plant defense responses. The autoimmune phenotypes of <i>mkk6</i> and <i>anp2 anp3</i> mutant plants can be largely suppressed by a constitutively active <i>mpk4</i> mutant. Further analysis showed that the constitutive defense response in <i>anp2 anp3</i> is dependent on the defense regulators PAD4 and EDS1, but not on SUMM2, suggesting that the ANP2/ANP3-MKK6-MPK4 cascade may be guarded by a TIR-NB-LRR protein. Our study shows that MKK6 has multiple functions in plant defense responses in addition to cytokinesis.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p>Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the <i>SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping in two ‘Crimson Seedless’-derived F1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.</p>

GS<sup>yellow</sup>, a Multifaceted Tag for Functional Protein Analysis in Monocot and Dicot Plants
<p>The ability to tag proteins has boosted the emergence of generic molecular methods for protein functional analysis. Fluorescent protein tags are used to visualize protein localization, and affinity tags enable the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem affinity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multifunctional tandem affinity purification tag, named GS<sup>yellow</sup>, which combines the streptavidin-binding peptide tag with citrine yellow fluorescent protein. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a set of bench<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>k proteins. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction profile of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), fused to the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag, along the growth zone of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf. To further explore the function of ZmAN3, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped its DNA-binding landscape in the growth zone of the maize leaf through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparison with AN3 target genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of protein functional analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves transforming a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of oil palm.

Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

Modeling the ecology and evolution of biodiversity: Biogeographical cradles, museums, and graves
<p>Individual processes shaping geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical models and traditional experiments. To meet this challenge, we built a spatially explicit, mechanistic simulation model implementing adaptation, range shifts, fragmentation, speciation, dispersal, competition, and extinction, driven by modeled climates of the past 800,000 years in South America. Experimental topographic smoothing confirmed the impact of climate heterogeneity on diversification. The simulations identified regions and episodes of speciation (cradles), persistence (museums), and extinction (graves). Although the simulations had no target pattern and were not parameterized with empirical data, emerging richness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s closely resembled contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s for major taxa, confirming powerful roles for evolution and diversification driven by topography and climate.</p>

The dynamics of gene expression in vertebrate embryogenesis at single-cell resolution

Convergent evidence for widespread rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment
<p>Nitrogen availability is a pivotal control on terrestrial carbon sequestration and global climate change. Historical and contemporary views assume that nitrogen enters Earth’s land-surface ecosystems from the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a nitrogen source that rivals atmospheric nitrogen inputs across major sectors of the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the planet’s nitrogen balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weather</span></strong>ing model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of nitrogen are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this nitrogen are chemically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weather</span></strong>ed in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial nitrogen balance from 8 to 26%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth’s nitrogen budget, with implications for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.</p>

Nascent DNA methylome mapping reveals inheritance of hemimethylation at CTCF/cohesin sites

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

Jupiter’s interior and deep atmosphere: The initial pole-to-pole passes with the Juno spacecraft

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>INS (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>INS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>kers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125.

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease resistance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.</p>

However, genetic analyses of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) metabolome have been conducted mainly using natural accessions or a single biparental population. Here, the flag leaves from three interconnected chromosome segment substitution line populations with a common recurrent genetic background were used to dissect rice metabolic diversity. We effectively used multiple interconnected biparental populations, constructed by introducing genomic segments into Zhenshan 97 from ACC10 (A/Z), Minghui 63 (M/Z), and Nipponbare (N/Z), to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A total of 1,587 mQTL were generated, of which 684, 479, and 722 were obtained from the A/Z, M/Z, and N/Z chromosome segment substitution line populations, respectively, and we designated 99 candidate genes for 367 mQTL. In addition, 1,001 mQTL were generated specifically from joint linkage analysis with 25 candidate genes assigned. Several of these candidates were validated, such as <i>LOC_Os07g01020</i> for the in vivo content of pyridoxine and its derivative and <i>LOC_Os04g25980</i> for cis-zeatin glucosyltransferase activity.

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis control gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the control of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and regulate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-specificity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by controlling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of pavement cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in controlling MAPK signaling specificity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p>Genetic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, genetic variation in disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a genetic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> genes (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped multiple mutations to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these mutations were measured on basal defense, global gene expression, pri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>y metabolism, and disease resistance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated.

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific variation of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural variation in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant variation. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative variation than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that variation in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than photosynthesis. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring.

The new mutants provide compelling genetic evidence that Peking-type <i>rhg1</i> resistance in cv Forrest is fully dependent on the <i>GmSHMT08</i> gene and demonstrates that this resistance is mechanistically different from the PI 88788-type of resistance that only requires <i>rhg1</i>. We also demonstrated that <i>rhg1-a</i> from cv Forrest, although required, does not exert selection pressure on the nematode to shift from HG type 7, which further validates the bigenic nature of this resistance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of the identified mutations onto the SHMT structural model uncovered key residues for structural stability, ligand binding, enzyme activity, and protein interactions, suggesting that GmSHMT08 has additional functions aside from its main enzymatic role in SCN resistance. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of the <i>GmSHMT08</i> SCN resistance gene in a transgenic soybean plant.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping and QTL Mapping Reveals the Genetic Architecture of Maize Plant Growth
<p>With increasing demand for novel traits in crop breeding, the plant research community faces the challenge of quantitatively analyzing the structure and function of large numbers of plants. A clear goal of high-throughput phenotyping is to bridge the gap between genomics and phenomics. In this study, we quantified 106 traits from a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) recombinant inbred line population (<i>n</i> = 167) across 16 developmental stages using the automatic phenotyping platform. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping with a high-density genetic linkage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>, including 2,496 recombinant bins, was used to uncover the genetic basis of these complex agronomic traits, and 988 QTLs have been identified for all investigated traits, including three QTL hotspots. Biomass accumulation and final yield were predicted using a combination of dissected traits in the early growth stage. These results reveal the dynamic genetic architecture of maize plant growth and enhance ideotype-based maize breeding and prediction.</p>

Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Altering Pollen Soluble Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity<xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates and protein kinases involved is vital to understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate biological function in eukaryotic cells. Pyrophosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) to inorganic phosphate P<sub>i</sub>, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic phosphate. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family I soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two pollen-expressed sPPases, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, from the flowering plant <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> phosphorylation sites to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these pollen sPPases. Despite the absence of reports in the literature on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping phosphorylation sites on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes identified a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p26.1a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2.5-fold at pH 6.8 and 52% in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key sites can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events. As sPPases are essential for many metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells, our findings identify the phosphorylation of sPPases as a potential master regulatory mechanism that could be used to attenuate metabolism.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>A<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mar</span></strong>anthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> at the F4 stage of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual genes. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chart</span></strong> the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chart</span></strong>ed based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden phases” are metastable collective states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong>s. These phases can host exotic properties in otherwise conventional materials and hence may enable novel functionality and applications, but their discovery and access are still in early stages. Using intense terahertz electric field excitation, we found that an ultrafast phase transition into a hidden ferroelectric phase can be dynamically induced in quantum paraelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>). The induced lowering in crystal symmetry yields substantial changes in the phonon excitation spectra. Our results demonstrate collective coherent control over material structure, in which a single-cycle field drives ions along the microscopic pathway leading directly to their locations in a new crystalline phase on an ultrafast time scale.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable superconducting and correlated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce superconductivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the superconducting phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong> and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

Entropy-driven stability of chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes
<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are hollow cylinders that can grow centimeters long via carbon incorporation at the interface with a catalyst. They display semiconducting or metallic characteristics, depending on their helicity, which is determined during their growth. To support the quest for a selective synthesis, we develop a thermodynamic model that relates the tube-catalyst interfacial energies, temperature, and the resulting tube chirality. We show that nanotubes can grow chiral because of the configurational entropy of their nanometer-sized edge, thus explaining experimentally observed temperature evolutions of chiral distributions. Taking the chemical nature of the catalyst into account through interfacial energies, we derive structural maps and phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong>s that will guide a rational choice of a catalyst and growth parameters toward a better selectivity.</p>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and fluidity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to liquid crystals, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent building blocks. We dispersed micrometer-long inorganic colloidal rods in a nematic liquid crystalline fluid of molecular rods. Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic fluid, in which like-sized rods are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal rods. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong> with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of rods. Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-colloidal fluids can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many biological systems incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered systems, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chart</span></strong>s a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.</p>

Stripe order in the underdoped region of the two-dimensional Hubbard model
<p>Competing inhomogeneous orders are a central feature of correlated electron materials, including the high-temperature superconductors. The two-dimensional Hubbard model serves as the canonical microscopic physical model for such systems. Multiple orders have been proposed in the underdoped part of the phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong>, which corresponds to a regime of maximum numerical difficulty. By combining the latest numerical methods in exhaustive simulations, we uncover the ordering in the underdoped ground state. We find a stripe order that has a highly compressible wavelength on an energy scale of a few kelvin, with wavelength fluctuations coupled to pairing order. The favored filled stripe order is different from that seen in real materials. Our results demonstrate the power of modern numerical methods to solve microscopic models, even in challenging settings.</p>

Spin-imbalance in a 2D Fermi-Hubbard system
<p>The interplay of strong interactions and magnetic fields gives rise to unusual forms of superconductivity and magnetism in quantum many-body systems. Here, we present an experimental study of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model—a paradigm for strongly correlated fermions on a lattice—in the presence of a Zeeman field and varying doping. Using site-resolved measurements, we revealed anisotropic antiferromagnetic correlations, a precursor to long-range canted order. We observed nonmonotonic behavior of the local polarization with doping for strong interactions, which we attribute to the evolution from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a metallic phase. Our results pave the way to experimentally mapping the low-temperature phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong> of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a function of both doping and spin polarization, for which many open questions remain.</p>

Exploring genetic suppression interactions on a global scale
<p>Genetic suppression occurs when the phenotypic defects caused by a mutation in a particular gene are rescued by a mutation in a second gene. To explore the principles of genetic suppression, we examined both literature-curated and unbiased experimental data, involving systematic genetic mapping and whole-genome sequencing, to generate a large-scale suppression network among yeast genes. Most suppression pairs identified novel relationships among functionally related genes, providing new insights into the functional wiring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong> of the cell. In addition to suppressor mutations, we identified frequent secondary mutations,in a subset of genes, that likely cause a delay in the onset of stationary phase, which appears to promote their enrichment within a propagating population. These findings allow us to formulate and quantify general mechanisms of genetic suppression.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic interaction network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagram</span></strong> of the cell.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p>Gene homology helps us understand gene function and speciation. The number of plant genes and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous genes of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant gene of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chart</span></strong>s of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Causal Associations of Adiposity and Body Fat Distribution With Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke Subtypes, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The implications of different adiposity measures on cardiovascular disease etiology remain unclear. In this article, we quantify and contrast causal associations of central adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index [WHRadjBMI]) and general adiposity (body mass index [BMI]) with cardiometabolic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ninety-seven independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms for BMI and 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for WHRadjBMI were used to conduct Mendelian randomization analyses in 14 prospective studies supplemented with coronary heart disease (CHD) data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics; combined total 66 842 cases), stroke from METASTROKE (12 389 ischemic stroke cases), type 2 diabetes mellitus from DIAGRAM (Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis; 34 840 cases), and lipids from GLGC (Global Lipids Genetic Consortium; 213 500 participants) consortia. Primary outcomes were CHD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major stroke subtypes; secondary analyses included 18 cardiometabolic traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each one standard deviation (SD) higher WHRadjBMI (1 SD≈0.08 U) associated with a 48% excess risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR] for CHD, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–1.71), similar to findings for BMI (1 SD≈4.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; OR for CHD, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22–1.52). Only WHRadjBMI increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03–1.70). For type 2 diabetes mellitus, both measures had large effects: OR, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.38–2.42) and OR, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.41–2.78) per 1 SD higher WHRadjBMI and BMI, respectively. Both WHRadjBMI and BMI were associated with higher left ventricular hypertrophy, glycemic traits, interleukin 6, and circulating lipids. WHRadjBMI was also associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness (39%; 95% CI, 9%–77% per 1 SD).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Both general and central adiposity have causal effects on CHD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> control and phase-aligned state manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s involving heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in the rovibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al ground state. We prepare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es as a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the magnetic field. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 resonances in the magnetic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with except<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of individual iron and titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> electron spin resonance. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to move single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we found that the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strongly depended on the binding configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. We could extract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>- and posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-dependent informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and nanostructures.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally deleted critical inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es including arginase-1 and resistin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of vascular cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1. Condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally deleting the vascular cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1.</p></sec>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al materials are attractive for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar nanofiltrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es while blocking solute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to enable size-selective separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The SWNT network physically separates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ratio for salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, and they retain stable separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> performance in tubular modules.</p>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p>Magnetic single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>alized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fash<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in all three spatial direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strength, revealing angstrom-scale reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s where the quantum states of two magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on magnetic single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e sensors.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s are trapped in a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optical lattice that enables cycles of compress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, 1400 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and ferm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays
<p>The realizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of regular one-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al arrays of individually controlled cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s by replacing lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with surplus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s from a reservoir.

Real-space imaging of molecular structure and chemical bonding by single-molecule inelastic tunneling probe
<p>The arrangement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and bonds in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e influences its physical and chemical properties. The scanning tunneling microscope can provide electronic and vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al signatures of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. However, these signatures do not relate simply to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar structure and bonding. We constructed an inelastic tunneling probe based on the scanning tunneling microscope to sense the local potential energy landscape of an adsorbed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e with a carbon monoxide (CO)–terminated tip. The skeletal structure and bonding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e are revealed from imaging the spatial variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of a CO vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as the CO-terminated tip probes the core of the interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s.

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip

Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA).

The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells

At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents.

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in a single, controlled react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> forms an excited-state NaCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar dissociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> threshold and measurement of collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es for qubits.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic plane from a bulk crystal. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of downstream signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Our single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis, we found that the diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels

Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other mon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels.

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them.

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar bonds.

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to specifically perturb cellular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e effectors of various cellular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro.

The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic electron-electron interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of existing models for solid-state photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> models.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-transporting protein funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–mediated site- and direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-selective restorat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of iron transport. They also suggest that small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that partially mimic the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules
<p>It is still not possible to predict whether a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e will have a perceived odor or what olfactory percept it will produce. We therefore organized the crowd-sourced DREAM Olfact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Predict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Challenge. Using a large olfactory psychophysical data set, teams developed machine-learning algorithms to predict sensory attributes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es based on their chemoinformatic features. The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit. These models help to predict the perceptual qualities of virtually any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e with high accuracy and also reverse-engineer the smell of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s is an essential part of crystal structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power.

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different act<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on their neuron targets, including directly opening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels or acting through signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al change in glomerular filtrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22).

Previously, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s have forced a compromise between clock stability, which benefits from a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency shifts.

We show that contact interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are resolved so that their contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to clock shifts is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments. A synchronous clock comparison between two reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the 3D lattice yields a measurement precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 5 × 10<sup>–19</sup> in 1 hour of averaging time.</p>

Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and work at molar concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to being an energy source for biological react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, for which micromolar concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in cells.</p>

Reversion of antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by spiroisoxazoline SMARt-420
<p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to human health globally. Alarmingly, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> have now spread worldwide. Some key antituberculosis antibiotics are prodrugs, for which resistance mechanisms are mainly driven by mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the bacterial enzymatic pathway required for their bioactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We have developed drug-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that activate a cryptic alternative bioactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway of eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, circumventing the classic activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway in which resistance mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s have now been observed. The first-of-its-kind <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, named SMARt-420 (Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Aborting Resistance), not only fully reverses eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide-acquired resistance and clears eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide-resistant infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in mice, it also increases the basal sensitivity of bacteria to eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide.</p>

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma. Thus, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s may promote hallmark features of asthma and are targetable by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111). The high quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s allowed collection of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> x-ray diffraction data of up to 0.83-angstrom resolution, leading to unambiguous solution and precise anisotropic refinement. Characteristics such as degree of interpenetration, arrangement of water guests, the reversed imine connectivity, linker disorder, and uncommon topology were deciphered with atomic precision—aspects impossible to determine without single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Entanglement between two spatially separated atomic modes
<p>Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology require the creation and control of large ensembles of entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. In ultracold ensembles of neutral atoms, nonclassical states have been generated with mutual entanglement among thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. The entanglement generation relies on the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e-exchange symmetry in ensembles of identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, which lacks the standard notion of entanglement between clearly definable subsystems. Here, we present the generation of entanglement between two spatially separated clouds by splitting an ensemble of ultracold identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es prepared in a twin Fock state. Because the clouds can be addressed individually, our experiments open a path to exploit the available entangled states of indistinguishable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es for quantum information applications.</p>

Electronic crystal growth

The time evolution of the atomic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled liquid or a glass.

The temperature profile of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization.</p>

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number. However, no studies have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary prevention trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models adjusting for risk factors evaluated associations between HDL-related biomarkers and incident CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cholesterol efflux capacity was moderately correlated with HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number (Spearman <i>r</i>= 0.39, 0.48, and 0.39 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). Baseline HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08). Twelve months of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average percentage change −1.5%, 95% CI, −13.3 to +10.2; <i>P</i>=0.80), but increased HDL cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number (+5.2%).

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation in China.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> nucleation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through alloy design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease
<p>Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) are protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s produced by human eosinophils, immune cells typically associated with allergy and parasitic worm (helminth) infection. These responses involve the “type 2” arm of the immune system, and CLCs are a hallmark of the more severe pathologies that can occur during type 2 inflammation, such as allergic asthma. Although described over 160 years ago, the biological relevance of CLCs to type 2 immunity has remained unknown. On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but not the soluble proteins, are powerful promoters of allergic inflammation and can be targeted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies to reverse disease symptoms.</p>

Giant piezoelectricity of Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystals
<p>High-performance piezoelectrics benefit transducers and sensors in a variety of electromechanical applications. The materials with the highest piezoelectric charge coefficients (<i>d</i><sub>33</sub>) are relaxor-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, which were discovered two decades ago. We successfully grew Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (Sm-PMN-PT) single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with even higher <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> values ranging from 3400 to 4100 picocoulombs per newton, with variation below 20% over the as-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> boule, exhibiting good property uniformity. We characterized the Sm-PMN-PT on the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy and made first-principles calculations to determine that the giant piezoelectric properties arise from the enhanced local structural heterogeneity introduced by Sm<sup>3+</sup> dopants. Rare-earth doping is thus identified as a general strategy for introducing local structural heterogeneity in order to enhance the piezoelectricity of relaxor ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transition from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar dust, which are carbonaceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es formed under similar conditions. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation, the molecular pathways that initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid molecular clustering–reaction pathways involving radicals with extended conjugation. These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier hydrogen-abstraction and hydrogen-ejection reactions. Such radical–chain reaction pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to condense at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e acceleration by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e populations via wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the deformed ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability

In either case, the chemical properties of the lasing medium or the momentum conservation in the nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> constrain the frequency and the bandwidth of the amplified pulses.

Such amplified pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly excited states in gases.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films

We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> and single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical vapor polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the vapor phase and then diffused into the liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> phase and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions.

This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges.

Although a C–H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph.

Our spectroscopy study, in conjunction with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free paths and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process. The single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> BAs has better thermal conductivity than other metals and semiconductors.

Two-channel model for ultralow thermal conductivity of crystalline Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>
<p>Solids with ultralow thermal conductivity are of great interest as thermal barrier coatings for insulation or thermoelectrics for energy conversion. However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal conductivity (κ) are unclear. In typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s a phonon picture is valid, whereas lowest κ values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and heat is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated oscillators. Here we identify a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated oscillators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with ultralow κ.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization could be suppressed.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric vehicles. Silicon has been highlighted as a promising anode material because of its superior specific capacity. During repeated charge-discharge cycles, silicon undergoes huge volume changes. This limits cycle life via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e pulverization and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, especially when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e sizes are in the micrometer range. We show that the incorporation of 5 weight % polyrotaxane to conventional polyacrylic acid binder imparts extraordinary elasticity to the polymer network originating from the ring sliding motion of polyrotaxane. This binder combination keeps even pulverized silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es coalesced without disintegration, enabling stable cycle life for silicon micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e anodes at commercial-level areal capacities.</p>

Architecture of the yeast small subunit processome

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e motion, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions. However, to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized controlled trial has been conducted to assess the effects of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was performed in a random subsample of volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea; n=296) after a 1-year intervention.

We assessed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells).

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator

There exists only a very limited set of possible surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> symmetries, captured by the 17 “wallpaper groups.” Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line insulators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a topological insulating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem.

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean neutron lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e physics and cosmology. It is used to predict the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e physics. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system
<p>Age-associated decline in regeneration capacity limits the restoration of nervous system functionality after injury. In a model for demyelination, we found that old mice fail to resolve the inflammatory response initiated after myelin damage. Aged phagocytes accumulated excessive amounts of myelin debris, which triggered cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> formation and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and stimulated inflammasomes. Myelin debris clearance required cholesterol transporters, including apolipoprotein E. Stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity of old mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. Thus, cholesterol-rich myelin debris can overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of cholesterol into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that impedes tissue regeneration.</p>

Moreover, a magnetic field suppresses the conductance, and the observed Zeeman-type gap indicates the existence of a Kramers degenerate point and the importance of time-reversal symmetry for protection from elastic backscattering.

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide

Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of the valence electrons into an exciton condensate.

Quantum and isotope effects in lithium metal
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure of elements at zero pressure and temperature is the most fundamental information in condensed matter physics. For decades it has been believed that lithium, the simplest metallic element, has a complicated ground-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure. Using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells and multiscale simulations with density functional theory and molecular dynamics, we show that the previously accepted martensitic ground state is metastable. The actual ground state is face-centered cubic (fcc). We find that isotopes of lithium, under similar thermal paths, exhibit a considerable difference in martensitic transition temperature. Lithium exhibits nuclear quantum mechanical effects, serving as a metallic intermediate between helium, with its quantum effect–dominated structures, and the higher-mass elements. By disentangling the quantum kinetic complexities, we prove that fcc lithium is the ground state, and we synthesize it by decompression.</p>

Rapid cooling and cold storage in a silicic magma reservoir recorded in individual crystals
<p>Silicic volcanic eruptions pose considerable hazards, yet the processes leading to these eruptions remain poorly known. A missing link is knowledge of the thermal history of magma feeding such eruptions, which largely controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>linity and therefore eruptability. We have determined the thermal history of individual zircon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s from an eruption of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Results show that although zircons resided in the magmatic system for 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> years, they experienced temperatures >650° to 750°C for only years to centuries. This implies near-solidus long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> storage, punctuated by rapid heating and cooling. Reconciling these data with existing models of magma storage requires considering multiple small intrusions and multiple spatial scales, and our approach can help to quantify heat input to and output from magma reservoirs.</p>

Biological control of aragonite formation in stony corals
<p>Little is known about how stony corals build their calcareous skeletons. There are two prevailing hypotheses: that it is a physicochemically dominated process and that it is a biologically mediated one. Using a combination of ultrahigh-resolution three<i>-</i>dimensional imaging and two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that mineral deposition is biologically driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es are initially deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid mineral phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic precipitation of aragonite.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% have mainly been demonstrated by using mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>) as an electron-transporting layer. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> can reduce the stability of PSCs under illumination (including ultraviolet light). Lanthanum (La)–doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> (LBSO) perovskite would be an ideal replacement given its electron mobility and electronic structure, but LBSO cannot be synthesized as well-dispersible fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lized below 500°C. We report a superoxide colloidal solution route for preparing a LBSO electrode under very mild conditions (below 300°C). The PSCs fabricated with LBSO and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) show a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2%, versus 19.7% for a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> device. The LBSO-based PSCs could retain 93% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full-Sun illumination.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of hydrogen atoms is an essential part of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of hydrogen atoms in nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line materials, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of precession electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen atoms in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) material. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the positions of hydrogen atoms in single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

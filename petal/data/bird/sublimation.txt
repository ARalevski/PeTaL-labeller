Brain Emboli After Left Ventricular Endocardial Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Catheter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion for ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion of atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to cardioversions and numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but cerebral embolic risk in ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled 18 consecutive patients meeting study criteria scheduled for ventricular tachycardia or PVC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion over a 9-month period. Patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion were compared with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion only. Patients were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion in all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural brain MRI was performed on each patient within a week of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion procedure. Embolic infarcts were defined as new foci of reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI within a vascular distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 58 years, half of the patients were men, half had a history of hypertension, and the majority had no known vascular disease or heart failure. LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion was performed in 12 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=2; PVC, n=10) and right ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion was performed exclusively in 6 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=1; PVC, n=5). Seven patients (58%) undergoing LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion experienced a total of 16 cerebral emboli, in comparison with zero patients undergoing right ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion (<i>P</i>=0.04). Seven of 11 patients (63%) undergoing a retrograde approach to the LV developed at least 1 new brain lesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>More than half of patients undergoing routine LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion procedures (predominately PVC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ions) experienced new brain emboli after the procedure.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refin</span></strong>ed our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 Î¼m in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma. Thus, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s may promote hallmark features of asthma and are targetable by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by âcontact-free annealingâ from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by âconsumptionâ of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111). The high quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s allowed collection of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> x-ray diffraction data of up to 0.83-angstrom resolution, leading to unambiguous solution and precise anisotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refin</span></strong>ement.

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3Â°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization.

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was â¼2.2â2.3 times greater in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 Î¼m. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a âglobalâ cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (â¤10 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 Î¼m) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the NephrinâNckâN-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity.

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory.

The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state.

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G proteinâcoupled receptors
<p>G proteinâcoupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G proteinâcoupling selectivity.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease
<p>Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) are protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s produced by human eosinophils, immune cells typically associated with allergy and parasitic worm (helminth) infection. These responses involve the âtype 2â arm of the immune system, and CLCs are a hallmark of the more severe pathologies that can occur during type 2 inflammation, such as allergic asthma. Although described over 160 years ago, the biological relevance of CLCs to type 2 immunity has remained unknown. On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but not the soluble proteins, are powerful promoters of allergic inflammation and can be targeted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies to reverse disease symptoms.</p>

Giant piezoelectricity of Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystals
<p>High-performance piezoelectrics benefit transducers and sensors in a variety of electromechanical applications. The materials with the highest piezoelectric charge coefficients (<i>d</i><sub>33</sub>) are relaxor-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, which were discovered two decades ago. We successfully grew Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (Sm-PMN-PT) single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with even higher <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> values ranging from 3400 to 4100 picocoulombsÂ perÂ newton, with variation below 20% over the as-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> boule, exhibiting good property uniformity. We characterized the Sm-PMN-PT on the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy and made first-principles calculations to determine that the giant piezoelectric properties arise from the enhanced local structural heterogeneity introduced by Sm<sup>3+</sup> dopants. Rare-earth doping is thus identified as a general strategy for introducing local structural heterogeneity in order to enhance the piezoelectricity of relaxor ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4â</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)âperoxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Self-assembly of lattices with high structural complexity from a geometrically simple molecule
<p>Here we report an anomalous porous molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> built of CâHÂ·Â·Â·N-bonded double-layered roof-floor components and wall components of a segregatively interdigitated architecture. This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-floor formation and using its other wedge for wall formation. Although a CâHÂ·Â·Â·N bond is extremely labile, the porous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the CâHÂ·Â·Â·N bonds at 202Â°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph. Though this nonporous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> survives even at 325Â°C, it can retrieve the parent porosity under acetonitrile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>. These findings show how one can translate simplicity into ultrahigh complexity.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary âplasticityâ can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out âin complete darkness.â Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of Îµ<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the deformed ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p>Amplification of femtosecond laser pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. In either case, the chemical properties of the lasing medium or the momentum conservation in the nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> constrain the frequency and the bandwidth of the amplified pulses. We demonstrate high gain amplification (greater than 1000) of widely tunable (0.5 to 2.2 micrometers) and short (less than 60 femtosecond) laser pulses, up to intensities of 1 terawatt per square centimeter, by seeding the modulation instability in an Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> pumped by femtosecond near-infrared pulses. Our method avoids constraints related to doping and phase matching and therefore can occur in a wider pool of glasses and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s even at far-infrared frequencies and for single-cycle pulses. Such amplified pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly excited states in gases.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility.

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>â<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, âWhat if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?â This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be firstâand to derive value from being firstâis compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters

The latter 800-kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4Fe-4S] clusters. Catalysis is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase.

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35Â in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (pÂ <Â 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the bone during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677â83</p>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70â80 mmâHg) or lower (40â50 mmâHg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 LÂ·min<sup>â1</sup>Â·m<sup>â2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imagingâevaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0â118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0â25â261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0â143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0â22â116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, â25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0â2; range, 0â24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0â2; range, 0â29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0â0; <i>P</i>=0.71). No significant difference was observed in frequency of severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, targeting a higher versus a lower mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not seem to affect the volume or number of new cerebral infarcts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Binding of FUN14 Domain Containing 1 With Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor in Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes Maintains Mitochondrial Dynamics and Function in Hearts in Vivo

Consistently, <i>Fundc1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in ER, whereas <i>Fundc1</i> overexpression lowered ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Further, <i>Fundc1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion in cardiomyocytes elongated mitochondria and compromised mitochondrial functions. Mechanistically, we found that <i>Fundc1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion-induced reduction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels suppressed mitochondrial fission 1 protein (<i>Fis1</i>) expression and mitochondrial fission by reducing the binding of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the <i>Fis1</i> promoter. <i>Fundc1</i><sup><i>f/Y</i></sup><i>/Cre</i><sup><i>Î±MyHC+/â</i></sup> mice but not their littermate control mice (<i>Fundc1</i><sup><i>wt/Y</i></sup><i>/Cre</i><sup><i>Î±MyHC+/â</i></sup>) exhibited cardiac dysfunction.

Phase changes in neurotransmission
<p>Clusters of synaptic vesicles (SVs) are distinctive features of axon terminals in neurons. SVs contain neurotransmitters that are released upon electrical activity.

It has remained enigmatic what holds these vesicles together in clusters. On page 604 of this issue, Milovanovic <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that synapsin 1, a protein that is essential for SV cluster formation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>es into liquid droplets in vitro.

Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates

Mediator and Pol II each form small transient and large stable clusters in living embryonic stem cells.

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new particles and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new particles. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>s (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>âdimethylamine (DMA)âwater (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the particle growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary particle formation in China.</p>

However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal conductivity (Îº) are unclear. In typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s a phonon picture is valid, whereas lowest Îº values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and heat is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated oscillators. Here we identify a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon Îº [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured Îº (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder Îº values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of Îº reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated oscillators explains the measured Îº and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with ultralow Îº.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 Â± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and fluidity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent building blocks. We dispersed micrometer-long inorganic colloidal rods in a nematic liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line fluid of molecular rods. Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic fluid, in which like-sized rods are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal rods. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase diagram with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of rods. Displaying properties of biaxial optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, these hybrid molecular-colloidal fluids can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds
<p>A key resource for distributed quantum-enhanced protocols is entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated modes. However, the robust generation and detection of entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated regions of an ultracold atomic system remain a challenge. We used spin mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate to generate an entangled state of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization could be suppressed.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures
<p>Weyl points are the crossings of linearly dispersing energy bands of three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, providing the opportunity to explore a variety of intriguing phenomena such as topologically protected surface states and chiral anomalies. However, the lack of an ideal Weyl system in which the Weyl points all exist at the same energy and are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated from any other bands poses a serious limitation to the further development of Weyl physics and potential applications. By experimentally characterizing a microwave photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> of saddle-shaped metallic coils, we observed ideal Weyl points that are related to each other through symmetry operations. Topological surface states exhibiting helicoidal structure have also been demonstrated. Our system provides a photonic platform for exploring ideal Weyl systems and developing possible topological devices.</p>

Ordered macro-microporous metal-organic framework single crystals
<p>We constructed highly oriented and ordered macropores within metal-organic framework (MOF) single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, opening up the area of three-dimensionalâordered macro-microporous materials (that is, materials containing both macro- and micropores) in single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line form. Our methodology relies on the strong shaping effects of a polystyrene nanosphere monolith template and a double-solventâinduced heterogeneous nucleation approach. This process synergistically enabled the in situ growth of MOFs within ordered voids, rendering a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> with oriented and ordered macro-microporous structure. The improved mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion properties of such hierarchical frameworks, together with their robust single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line nature, endow them with superior catalytic activity and recyclability for bulky-molecule reactions, as compared with conventional, poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line hollow, and disordered macroporous ZIF-8.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust materials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense hydrogen bonds, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable materials, despite their extremely slow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag hydrogen-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

The image-forming mirror in the eye of the scallop
<p>Scallops possess a visual system comprising up to 200 eyes, each containing a concave mirror rather than a lens to focus light. The hierarchical organization of the multilayered mirror is controlled for image formation, from the component guanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s at the nanoscale to the complex three-dimensional morphology at the millimeter level. The layered structure of the mirror is tuned to reflect the wavelengths of light penetrating the scallopâs habitat and is tiled with a mosaic of square guanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, which reduces optical aberrations. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately imaging the peripheral and central fields of view. The tiled, off-axis mirror of the scallop eye bears a striking resemblance to the segmented mirrors of reflecting telescopes.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Robust epitaxial growth of two-dimensional heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices
<p>We report a general synthetic strategy for highly robust growth of diverse lateral heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices from two-dimensional (2D) atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s. A reverse flow during the temperature-swing stage in the sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> deposition growth process allowed us to cool the existing 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s to prevent undesired thermal degradation and uncontrolled homogeneous nucleation, thus enabling highly robust block-by-block epitaxial growth. Raman and photoluminescence mapping studies showed that a wide range of 2D heterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>), multiheterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>), and superlattices (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>) were readily prepared with precisely controlled spatial modulation. Transmission electron microscope studies showed clear chemical modulation with atomically sharp interfaces. Electrical transport studies of WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub> lateral junctions showed well-defined diode characteristics with a rectification ratio up to 10<sup>5</sup>.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion. To mitigate the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

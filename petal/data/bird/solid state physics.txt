Disparities in science literacy
<p>Much is known about how adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy varies internationally and over time, and about its association with attitudes and beliefs. However, less is known about disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy across racial and ethnic groups (<i>1</i>). This is particularly surprising in light of substantial research on racial and ethnic disparities in related areas such as educational achievement, math and reading ability (<i>2</i>), representation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations (<i>3</i>), and health literacy (<i>4</i>). Given the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy to securing and sustaining many jobs, to understanding key health concepts to enhance quality of life, and to increasing public engagement in societal decision-making (<i>5</i>), it is concerning if the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy is unequally stratified, particularly if this stratification reflects broader patterns of disadvantage and cultural dominance as experienced by minorities and educationally underserved populations. We describe here such disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy in the United States and attempt to explain underlying drivers, concluding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy disadvantage among black and Hispanic adults relative to whites is only partially explained by measures of broader, foundational literacies and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson coupling plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors, its relation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity.</p>

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave photons in a one-dimensional array of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-photon quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-photon quantum walks by exciting two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting photons from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of photons with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Phonon-mediated quantum state transfer and remote qubit entanglement
<p>Phonons, and in particular surface acoustic wave phonons, have been proposed as a means to coherently couple distant solid-state quantum systems. Individual phonons in a resonant structure can be controlled and detected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits, enabling the coherent generation and measurement of complex stationary phonon states. We report the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons, enabling the quantum entanglement of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits. Using a 2-millimeter-long acoustic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500-nanosecond delay line, we demonstrate the emission and recapture of a phonon by one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit, quantum state transfer between two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits with a 67% efficiency, and, by partial transfer of a phonon, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of 84%.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in a topologically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian topological states. However, existing demonstrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>or-insulator switches have involved only topologically trivial systems. Here we report reversible, in situ electrostatic on-off switching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in the recently established quantum spin Hall insulator monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>). Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer’s ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the topological insulating to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin.

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing cuprates is masked by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high magnetic fields to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong magnetic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood. We report the high-field magnetoresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190. We find that the metallic state exposed by suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity is characterized by magnetoresistance that is linear in magnetic fields up to 80 tesla. The magnitude of the linear-in-field resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors.</p>

Evidence for bulk superconductivity in pure bismuth single crystals at ambient pressure
<p>At ambient pressure, bulk rhombohedral bismuth is a semimetal that remains in the normal state down to at least 10 millikelvin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in bulk bismuth is thought to be unlikely because of the extremely low carrier density. We observed bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in pure bismuth single crystals below 0.53 millikelvin at ambient pressure, with an estimated critical magnetic field of 5.2 microteslas at 0 kelvin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in bismuth cannot be explained by the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory because its adiabatic approximation does not hold true for bismuth.

Studies were included if they applied a diet or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention effects were calculated for systolic BP and diastolic BP with the use of weighted random-effects models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on diastolic BP.

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>es, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. Wave systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s need not be restricted to wave dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing and correlated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

German law allows use of DNA to predict suspects' looks

The controversial law, which passed the Landtag, the state parliament in Munich, on 15 May, is the first in Germany to allow what has been dubbed DNA phenotyping, and it has sparked renewed debate here and in other countries about the advantages—and risks—of the technology. German federal authorities, and police in the country's 15 other states, are only allowed to perform DNA fingerprinting, in which they look for an exact match between crime scene DNA and samples in a database of known criminals or from a suspect. DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction, however, have been used in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several U.S. states. Some critics caution that although the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e connecting genetic markers to certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al features is solid, DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction still come with significant uncertainties that can be easily misunderstood by police and the public.</p>

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean neutron lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and cosmology.

We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

Most of the proposed topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures.

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observations of binary stars containing an accreting black hole or neutron star often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the solar corona.

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars.

Convergence Between Science and Environmental Education
<p>Urgent issues such as climate change, food scarcity, malnutrition, and loss of biodiversity are highly complex and contested in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e and society (<i>1</i>). To address them, environmental educators and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e educators seek to engage people in what are commonly referred to as sustainability challenges. Regrettably, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e education (SE), which focuses primarily on teaching knowledge and skills, and environmental education (EE), which also stresses the incorporation of values and changing behaviors, have become increasingly distant. The relationship between SE and EE has been characterized as “distant, competitive, predatorprey and host-parasite” (<i>2</i>). We examine the potential for a convergence of EE and SE that might engage people in addressing fundamental socioecological challenges.</p>

Gate-induced superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>The layered semimetal tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>) has recently been found to be a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) when thinned down to a single monolayer, with conducting helical edge channels. We found that intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity can be induced in this monolayer 2D TI by mild electrostatic doping at temperatures below 1 kelvin. The 2D TI–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>or transition can be driven by applying a small gate voltage. This discovery offers possibilities for gate-controlled devices combining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity and nontrivial topological properties, and could provide a basis for quantum information schemes based on topological protection.</p>

Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor
<p>The search for Majorana bound states (MBSs) has been fueled by the prospect of using their non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. Two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing topological materials have been predicted to host MBSs as zero-energy modes in vortex cores. By using scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing Dirac surface state of the iron-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>or FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub>, we observed a sharp zero-bias peak inside a vortex core that does not split when moving away from the vortex center. The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and tunneling barrier is consistent with the tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.</p>

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al or chemical damage. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical damage. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals forces upon mechanical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.</p>

Optical skyrmion lattice in evanescent electromagnetic fields

A skyrmion is a type of topological defect that has shown promise for applications in the fields of magnetic storage and spintronics. We show that optical skyrmion lattices can be generated using evanescent electromagnetic fields and demonstrate this using surface plasmon polaritons, imaged by phase-resolved near-field optical microscopy. We show how the optical skyrmion lattice exhibits robustness to imperfections while the topological domain walls in the lattice can be continuously tuned, changing the spatial structure of the skyrmions from bubble type to Néel type. Extending the generation of skyrmions to photonic systems provides various possibilities for applications in optical information processing, transfer, and storage.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

The controversial correlates of consciousness

Although the field of consciousness studies attracts a diverse array of thinkers who posit myriad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al or meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al substrates for experience, consciousness must have a neural basis. But where in the brain is conscious experience generated? It would seem that, given this remarkable era of technical and experimental prowess in the neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>es, we would be homing in on the specific circuits or precise neuronal subpopulations that generate experience. To the contrary, there is still active debate as to whether the neural correlates of consciousness are, in coarse terms, located in the back or the front of the brain (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). On page 537 of this issue, van Vugt <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is one of the brain regions that mediates visual consciousness. Additionally, Joglekar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is important for igniting neural networks that contribute to visual signal processing.

A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits
<p>A key step toward demonstrating a quantum system that can address difficult problems in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and chemistry will be performing a computation beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, thus achieving so-called quantum supremacy. In this study, we used nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits to demonstrate a promising path toward quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we were able to generate thousands of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert space. As the number of qubits increases, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Extending these results to a system of 50 qubits has the potential to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points

We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological photonics, non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear optics, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing tunneling to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear optical response. A giant terahertz third harmonic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson tunneling, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin. We model these results by hypothesizing the presence of a pair density wave condensate, in which nonlinear mixing of optically silent tunneling modes drives large dipole-carrying supercurrents.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. Our findings show that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport properti</span></strong>es, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene cones, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 atoms in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange atoms in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum information processing, quantum simulations, and precision measurements.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al complexity of the territory.</p>

Do radiological and functional outcomes correlate for fractures of the distal radius?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a study to determine whether radiological parameters   correlate with patient reported functional outcome, health-related   quality of life and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al measures of function in patients with   a fracture of the distal radius.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The post-operative palmar tilt and ulnar variance at six weeks   and 12 months were correlated with the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation,   Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, and EuroQol scores,   grip strength, pinch strength and range of movement at three, six   and 12 months for 50 patients (mean age 57 years; 26 to 85) having surgical   fixation, with either percutaneous pinning or reconstruction with   a volar plate, for a fracture of the distal radius.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Radiological parameters were found to correlate poorly with the   patient reported outcomes (r = 0.00 to 0.47) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al measures   of function (r = 0.01 to 0.51) at all intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study raises concerns about the use of radiological parameters   to determine management, and to act as a surrogates for successful   treatment, in patients with a fracture of the distal radius.

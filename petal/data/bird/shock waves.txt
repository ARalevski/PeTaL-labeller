OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast
<p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong>. SNAREs (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen resistance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host resistance to rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong>. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> in both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong>-resistant rice landrace Heikezijing and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong>-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong>. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the resistant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i>::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> penetration sites in transgenic rice, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong>. Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> resistance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle acceleration by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasma wav</span></strong>es and spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasma wav</span></strong>e fields. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions.</p>

Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers
<p>Food’s environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. Most strikingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of the lowest-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s to consumers.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Searching for hidden earthquakes in Southern California
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es follow a well-known power-law size relation, with smaller events occurring much more often than larger events. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e catalogs are thus dominated by small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es yet are still missing a much larger number of even smaller events because of signal fidelity issues. To overcome these limitations, we applied a template-matching detection technique to the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>form archive of the regional seismic network in Southern California. This effort resulted in a catalog with 1.81 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es, a 10-fold increase, which provides important insights into the geometry of fault zones at depth, foreshock behavior and nucleation processes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e-triggering mechanisms. The rich detail resolved in this type of catalog will facilitate the next generation of analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es and faults.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, shear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and shear properties. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s have been elusive in the direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismic wav</span></strong>efield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e coda correlation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in cell signaling.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p>Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s.

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity
<p>Establishing what controls the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es is fundamental to understanding the nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e cycle and critical to determining time-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e hazard. Seasonal loading provides a natural laboratory to explore the crustal response to a quantifiable transient force. In California, water storage deforms the crust as snow and water accumulates during the wet winter months. We used 9 years of global positioning system (GPS) vertical deformation time series to constrain models of monthly hydrospheric loading and the resulting stress changes on fault planes of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es. The seasonal loading analysis reveals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es occurring more frequently during stress conditions that favor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rupture. We infer that California seismicity rates are modestly modulated by natural hydrological loading cycles.</p>

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets.</p>

Quantifying the evolution of individual scientific impact
<p>Despite the frequent use of numerous quantitative indicators to gauge the professional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of a scientist, little is known about how scientific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> emerges and evolves in time. Here, we quantify the changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> and productivity throughout a career in science, finding that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>, as measured by influential publications, is distributed randomly within a scientist’s sequence of publications. This random-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> rule allows us to formulate a stochastic model that uncouples the effects of productivity, individual ability, and luck and unveils the existence of universal patterns governing the emergence of scientific success. The model assigns a unique individual parameter <i>Q</i> to each scientist, which is stable during a career, and it accurately predicts the evolution of a scientist’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>, from the <i>h</i>-index to cumulative citations, and independent recognitions, such as prizes.</p>

Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses
<p>The specific effects of sleep on synaptic plasticity remain unclear. We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripple oscillations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples during slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the learning of new memories. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples.</p>

Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves
<p>After an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e, the earliest deformation signals are not expected to be carried by the fastest (<i>P</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elastic wav</span></strong>es but by the speed-of-light changes of the gravitational field. However, these perturbations are weak and, so far, their detection has not been accurate enough to fully understand their origins and to use them for a highly valuable rapid estimate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e magnitude. We show that gravity perturbations are particularly well observed with broadband seismometers at distances between 1000 and 2000 kilometers from the source of the 2011, moment magnitude 9.1, Tohoku <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e.

The hidden simplicity of subduction megathrust earthquakes
<p>The largest observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es occur on subduction interfaces and frequently cause widespread damage and loss of life. Understanding the rupture behavior of megathrust events is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rupture physics, as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e early-warning systems. However, the large variability in behavior between individual events seemingly defies a description with a simple unifying model. Here we use three source time function (STF) data sets for subduction zone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es, with moment magnitude <i>M</i><sub>w </sub>≥ 7, and show that such large ruptures share a typical universal behavior. The median STF is scalable between events with different sizes, grows linearly, and is nearly triangular. The deviations from the median behavior are multiplicative and Gaussian—that is, they are proportionally larger for larger events. Our observations suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e magnitudes cannot be predicted from the characteristics of rupture onsets.</p>

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes

Through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>form modeling, we detected a large ultralow-velocity zone and constrained its shape to be axisymmetric to a very good first order. We thus attribute it to partial melting of a locally thickened, denser- and hotter-than-average layer, reflecting dynamics and elevated temperatures within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plume</span></strong> root. Such structures are few and far apart, and they may be characteristic of the roots of some of the broad mantle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plume</span></strong>s tomographically imaged within the large low-shear-velocity provinces in the lower mantle.</p>

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet
<p>Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a spherically symmetric s-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>.</p>

<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plume</span></strong> of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plume</span></strong> contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plume</span></strong>. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plume</span></strong> signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Mega-earthquakes rupture flat megathrusts
<p>The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and 2011 Tohoku-Oki <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es highlighted gaps in our understanding of mega-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rupture processes and the factors controlling their global distribution: A fast convergence rate and young buoyant lithosphere are not required to produce mega-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es. We calculated the curvature along the major subduction zones of the world, showing that mega-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es preferentially rupture flat (low-curvature) interfaces. A simplified analytic model demonstrates that heterogeneity in shear strength increases with curvature. Shear strength on flat megathrusts is more homogeneous, and hence more likely to be exceeded simultaneously over large areas, than on highly curved faults.</p>

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> disease, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important disease of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> disease, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> disease. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued disease symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> disease.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of plants to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on plant phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> pattern, were used to grow and assess plants. Plants subjected to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown plants. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, plants grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-grown plants. Despite high light use efficiency, plants grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that plants grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing plants under square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> growth conditions ultimately fails to predict plant performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer plant productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular defects in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   defects.

Ultrastable laser interferometry for earthquake detection with terrestrial and submarine cables
<p>Detecting ocean-floor seismic activity is crucial for our understanding of the interior structure and dynamic behavior of Earth. However, 70% of the planet’s surface is covered by water, and seismometer coverage is limited to a handful of permanent ocean bottom stations. We show that existing telecommunication optical fiber cables can detect seismic events when combined with state-of-the-art frequency metrology techniques by using the fiber itself as the sensing element. We detected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es over terrestrial and submarine links with lengths ranging from 75 to 535 kilometers and a geographical distance from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e’s epicenter ranging from 25 to 18,500 kilometers.

Mesophotic coral ecosystems are threatened and ecologically distinct from shallow water reefs
<p>The rapid degradation of coral reefs is one of the most serious biodiversity problems facing our generation. Mesophotic coral reefs (at depths of 30 to 150 meters) have been widely hypothesized to provide refuge from natural and anthropogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, a promise for the survival of shallow reefs. The potential role of mesophotic reefs as universal refuges is often highlighted in reef conservation research. This hypothesis rests on two assumptions: (i) that there is considerable overlap in species composition and connectivity between shallow and deep populations and (ii) that deep reefs are less susceptible to anthropogenic and natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s than their shallower counterparts. Here we present evidence contradicting these assumptions and argue that mesophotic reefs are distinct, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ed, and in as much need of protection as shallow coral reefs.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive yield from the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deton</span></strong>ation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent.

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.</p>

Postimpact earliest Paleogene warming shown by fish debris oxygen isotopes (El Kef, Tunisia)
<p>Greenhouse warming is a predicted consequence of the Chicxulub <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>, but supporting data are sparse. This shortcoming compromises understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>’s effects, and it has persisted due to an absence of sections that both contain suitable material for traditional carbonate- or organic-based paleothermometry and are complete and expanded enough to resolve changes on short time scales. We address the problem by analyzing the oxygen isotopic composition of fish debris, phosphatic microfossils that are relatively resistant to diagenetic alteration, from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary at El Kef, Tunisia. We report an ~1 per mil decrease in oxygen isotopic values (~5°C warming) beginning at the boundary and spanning ~300 centimeters of section (~100,000 years). The pattern found matches expectations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>-initiated greenhouse warming.</p>

A single fungal MAP kinase controls plant cell-to-cell invasion by the rice blast fungus
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> disease destroys up to 30% of the rice crop annually and threatens global food security. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> invades plant tissue with hyphae that proliferate and grow from cell to cell, often through pit fields, where plasmodesmata cluster. We showed that chemical genetic inhibition of a single fungal mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, Pmk1, prevents <i>M. oryzae</i> from infecting adjacent plant cells, leaving the fungus trapped within a single plant cell. Pmk1 regulates expression of secreted fungal effector proteins implicated in suppression of host immune defenses, preventing reactive oxygen species generation and excessive callose deposition at plasmodesmata. Furthermore, Pmk1 controls the hyphal constriction required for fungal growth from one rice cell to the neighboring cell, enabling host tissue colonization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> disease.</p>

Hydraulic fracturing volume is associated with induced earthquake productivity in the Duvernay play
<p>A sharp increase in the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es near Fox Creek, Alberta, began in December 2013 in response to hydraulic fracturing. Using a hydraulic fracturing database, we explore relationships between injection parameters and seismicity response. We show that induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es are associated with completions that used larger injection volumes (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cubic meters) and that seismic productivity scales linearly with injection volume. Injection pressure and rate have an insignificant association with seismic response. Further findings suggest that geological factors play a prominent role in seismic productivity, as evidenced by spatial correlations. Together, volume and geological factors account for ~96% of the variability in the induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rate near Fox Creek. This result is quantified by a seismogenic index–modified frequency-magnitude distribution, providing a framework to forecast induced seismicity.</p>

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system

The strong intrinsic attenuation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic attenuation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

Evolution of the wheat blast fungus through functional losses in a host specificity determinant

Studies on avirulence and resistance gene distributions, together with historical data on wheat cultivation in Brazil, suggest that wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blast</span></strong> emerged due to widespread deployment of <i>rwt3</i> wheat (susceptible to <i>Lolium</i> isolates), followed by the loss of function of <i>PWT3</i>.

Release of mineral-bound water prior to subduction tied to shallow seismogenic slip off Sumatra
<p>Plate-boundary fault rupture during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman subduction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e extended closer to the trench than expected, increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e and tsunami size. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 362 sampled incoming sediments offshore northern Sumatra, revealing recent release of fresh water within the deep sediments. Thermal modeling links this freshening to amorphous silica dehydration driven by rapid burial-induced temperature increases in the past 9 million years. Complete dehydration of silicates is expected before plate subduction, contrasting with prevailing models for subduction seismogenesis calling for fluid production during subduction. Shallow slip offshore Sumatra appears driven by diagenetic strengthening of deeply buried fault-forming sediments, contrasting with weakening proposed for the shallow Tohoku-Oki 2011 rupture, but our results are applicable to other thickly sedimented subduction zones including those with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e records.</p>

Fault activation by hydraulic fracturing in western Canada

A template-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e catalog from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive injection data during a 4-month interval, shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es are tightly clustered in space and time near hydraulic fracturing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic fracturing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material.

Chicxulub is the only known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling.

Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk

The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms.

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central metabolite involved in a multiplicity of plant metabolic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial metabolism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial metabolism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ed mitochondrial metabolism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-effect mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nova</span></strong>tion remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and chromosome-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

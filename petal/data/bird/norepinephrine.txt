Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?
<p>Animals use the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e to encode the relationship between their responses and reward. Reinforcement learning theory (<i>1</i>) successfully explains the role of phasic bursts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e in terms of future reward maximization. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e clearly plays other roles in shaping behavior that have no obvious relationship to reinforcement learning, including modulating the rate at which our subjective sense of time grows in real time. On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e function in timing—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e clock hypothesis (<i>3</i>). They may also help explain empirical phenomena that challenge the reinforcement learning account of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e function.</p>

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance, time flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons have been implicated in variable time estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons as mice judged the duration of time intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time estimates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons was sufficient to slow down or speed up time estimation, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neuron activity thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of time.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production
<p>Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR activation–dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) production, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.</p>

Ultrafast neuronal imaging of dopamine dynamics with designed genetically encoded sensors
<p>Neuromodulatory systems exert profound influences on brain function. Understanding how these systems modify the operating mode of target circuits requires spatiotemporally precise measurement of neuromodulator release. We developed dLight1, an intensity-based genetically encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e indicator, to enable optical recording of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution in behaving mice. We demonstrated the utility of dLight1 by imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e dynamics simultaneously with pharmacological manipulation, electrophysiological or optogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation, and calcium imaging of local neuronal activity. dLight1 enabled chronic tracking of learning-induced changes in millisecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e transients in mouse striatum. Further, we used dLight1 to image spatially distinct, functionally heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e transients relevant to learning and motor control in mouse cortex. We also validated our sensor design platform for developing norepinephrine, serotonin, melatonin, and opioid neuropeptide indicators.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e. In addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Phosphorylation of the exocyst protein Exo84 by TBK1 promotes insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking
<p>Insulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The exocyst complex tethers GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process that requires the binding of the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein) RalA to the exocyst complex. We report that upon activation of RalA, the protein kinase TBK1 phosphorylated the exocyst subunit Exo84. Knockdown of TBK1 blocked insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation; knockout of TBK1 in adipocytes blocked insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated glucose uptake; and ectopic overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 reduced insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of Exo84 by TBK1 reduced its affinity for RalA and enabled its release from the exocyst. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 blocked the dissociation of the TBK1/RalA/exocyst complex, and treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of TBK1 reduced the rate of complex dissociation. Introduction of phosphorylation-mimicking or nonphosphorylatable mutant forms of Exo84 blocked insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated GLUT4 translocation. Thus, these data indicate that TBK1 controls GLUT4 vesicle engagement and disengagement from the exocyst, suggesting that exocyst components not only constitute a tethering complex for the GLUT4 vesicle but also act as “gatekeepers” controlling vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their axonal projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating.

ZI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation generated 35% of normal 24-hour food intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by food deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of PVT glutamate neurons reduced food intake.

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 activation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in activating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 activation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with activation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated ERK1/2 activation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 activation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in activation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Mechanisms of inside-out signaling of the high-affinity IgG receptor FcγRI
<p>Fc receptors (FcRs) are an important bridge between the innate and adaptive immune system. Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI; CD64), the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG), plays roles in inflammation, autoimmune responses, and immunotherapy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of myeloid cells with cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor–α ( TNFα) and interferon-γ ( IFNγ), increases the binding of FcγRI to immune complexes (ICs), such as antibody-opsonized pathogens or tumor cells, through a process known as “inside-out” signaling. Using super-resolution imaging, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of cells with IL-3 also enhanced the clustering of FcγRI both before and after exposure to ICs. This increased clustering was dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton. We found that chemical inhibition of the activity of the phosphatase PP1 reduced FcγRI inside-out signaling, although the phosphorylation of FcγRI itself was unaffected. Furthermore, the antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity of human neutrophils toward CD20-expressing tumor cells was increased after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation with TNFα and IFNγ. These results suggest that nanoscale reorganization of FcγRI, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by cytokine-induced, inside-out signaling, enhances FcγRI cellular effector functions.</p>

The interaction between IKKα and LC3 promotes type I interferon production through the TLR9-containing LAPosome
<p>Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes DNA in endosomes and activates distinct signaling pathways to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). The assembly of signaling platforms on microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B–light chain 3 (LC3)–decorated endosomal vesicles is required to transduce TLR9 signals that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the production of IFN but not interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12p40). LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), a form of noncanonical autophagy, is critical for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and for IFN synthesis. We showed that after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides, the autophagy protein LC3 and the kinase IKKα were recruited to endosomes that contained TLR9. The recruitment of IKKα and LC3 to such signaling endosomes was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by catalysts of classical autophagosome formation but involved LAP formation, which required ATG5 but not FIP200. In addition, we found that the LC3-IKKα complex further associated with both TRAF3 and IRF7. We identified three putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) in IKKα, and mutagenesis suggested that two of these were critical for direct binding to LC3. Moreover, mutation of the same LIR sequences failed to rescue type I IFN production in IKKα-deficient dendritic cells upon reconstitution. Together, these data suggest a direct link between LAP formation and IKKα recruitment downstream of TLR9 activation that is necessary to facilitate type I IFN production.</p>

The intracellular pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase NT5C3A is a negative epigenetic factor in interferon and cytokine signaling
<p>The enzyme pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase (NT5C3A), which mediates nucleotide catabolism, was previously thought to be restricted to blood cells. We showed that expression of the gene encoding NT5C3A was induced by type I interferons (IFNs) in multiple cell types and that NT5C3A suppressed cytokine production through inhibition of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. <i>NT5C3A</i> expression required both an intronic IFN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated response element and the IFN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated transcription factor IRF1. Overexpression of NT5C3A, but not of its catalytic mutants, suppressed IL-8 production by HEK293 cells. Whereas knockdown of <i>NT5C3A</i> enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated IL-8 production, it reduced the IFN-mediated suppression of <i>Il8</i> expression. Overexpression of <i>NT5C3A</i> increased the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup> and the activation of the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6, which are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylases. NT5C3A-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated sirtuin activity resulted in deacetylation of histone H3 and the NF-κB subunit RelA (also known as p65), both of which were associated with the proximal region of the <i>Il8</i> promoter, thus repressing the transcription of <i>Il8</i>. Together, these data identify an anti-inflammatory pathway that depends on the catalytic activity of NT5C3A and functions as a negative feedback regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling.</p>

Biased signaling by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor–specific antibodies determines thyrocyte survival in autoimmunity
<p>The thyroid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor (GPCR). Autoimmune hyperthyroidism, commonly known as Graves’ disease (GD), is caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating autoantibodies to the TSHR. We previously described TSHR-specific antibodies (TSHR-Abs) in GD that recognize linear epitopes in the cleavage region of the TSHR ectodomain (C-TSHR-Abs) and induce thyroid cell apoptosis instead of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating the TSHR. We found that C-TSHR-Abs entered the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis but did not trigger endosomal maturation and failed to undergo normal vesicular sorting and trafficking. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating TSHR-Abs (S-TSHR-Abs) activated Gα<sub>s</sub> and, to a lesser extent, Gα<sub>q</sub> but that C-TSHR-Abs failed to activate any of the G proteins normally activated in response to TSH. Furthermore, specific inhibition of G proteins in the presence of S-TSHR-mAbs or TSH resulted in a similar failure of endosomal maturation as that caused by C-TSHR-mAbs. Hence, whereas S-TSHR-mAbs and TSH contributed to normal vesicular trafficking of TSHR through the activation of major G proteins, the C-TSHR-Abs resulted in GRK2- and β-arrestin-1–dependent biased signaling, which is interpreted as a danger signal by the cell. Our observations suggest that the binding of antibodies to different TSHR epitopes may decrease cell survival. Antibody-induced cell injury and the response to cell death amplify the loss of self-tolerance, which most likely helps to perpetuate GPCR-mediated autoimmunity.</p>

The tyrosine kinase Src promotes phosphorylation of the kinase TBK1 to facilitate type I interferon production after viral infection
<p>Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are activated in response to viral infection to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the production of type I interferons (IFNs). However, central to the responses of all of these receptors is their activation of the kinase TBK1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates transcription by IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We investigated the mechanism by which the kinase activity of TBK1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated in response to viral infection. We found that the tyrosine kinase Src promoted the phosphorylation of TBK1 on Tyr<sup>179</sup> upon viral infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. Mutation of Tyr<sup>179</sup> to alanine resulted in impaired autophosphorylation of TBK1 at Ser<sup>172</sup>, which is required for TBK1 activation. The TBK1 Y179A mutant failed to rescue type I IFN production by virally infected RAW264.7 macrophages deficient in TBK1. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with AZD0530 and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9–mediated knockout of Src demonstrated that Src was critical for activating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating type I IFN production. However, Src did not directly bind to recombinant TBK1 in vitro but instead bound to the proline-X-X-proline motifs within key PRR adaptor proteins, such as TRIF, MAVS, and STING, which formed complexes with TBK1 after PRR engagement. Together, our data suggest that Src is the major tyrosine kinase that primes TBK1 for autophosphorylation and activation, thus providing mechanistic insights into the regulation of TBK1 activity by various PRRs as part of the innate antiviral response.</p>

Dopamine oxidation mediates mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction have been implicated in substantia nigra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but how these pathways are linked in human neurons remains unclear. Here we studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic neurons derived from patients with idiopathic and familial PD. We identified a time-dependent pathological cascade beginning with mitochondrial oxidant stress leading to oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e accumulation and ultimately resulting in reduced glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity, lysosomal dysfunction, and α-synuclein accumulation. This toxic cascade was observed in human, but not in mouse, PD neurons at least in part because of species-specific differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e metabolism. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e synthesis or α-synuclein amounts in mouse midbrain neurons recapitulated pathological phenotypes observed in human neurons. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e oxidation represents an important link between mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex
<p>At the final stage of the ventral visual stream, perirhinal neurons encode the identity of memorized objects through learning.

Biased agonists of the kappa opioid receptor suppress pain and itch without causing sedation or dysphoria
<p>Agonists targeting the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) have been promising therapeutic candidates because of their efficacy for treating intractable itch and relieving pain. Unlike typical opioid narcotics, KOR agonists do not produce euphoria or lead to respiratory suppression or overdose. However, they do produce dysphoria and sedation, side effects that have precluded their clinical development as therapeutics. KOR signaling can be fine-tuned to preferentially activate certain pathways over others, such that agonists can bias signaling so that the receptor signals through G proteins rather than other effectors such as βarrestin2. We evaluated a newly developed G protein signaling–biased KOR agonist in preclinical models of pain, pruritis, sedation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e regulation, and dysphoria. We found that triazole 1.1 retained the antinociceptive and antipruritic efficacies of a conventional KOR agonist, yet it did not induce sedation or reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e release in mice, nor did it produce dysphoria as determined by intracranial self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation in rats. These data demonstrated that biased agonists may be used to segregate physiological responses downstream of the receptor. Moreover, the findings suggest that biased KOR agonists may present a means to treat pain and intractable itch without the side effects of dysphoria and sedation and with reduced abuse potential.</p>

RasGRP1 promotes amphetamine-induced motor behavior through a Rhes interaction network (“Rhesactome”) in the striatum
<p>The striatum of the brain coordinates motor function. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e-related drugs may be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side effects. In addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating the release of norepinephrine, amphetamines, which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic signaling in the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa–induced dyskinesia, and has a role in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice. RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum. Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (<i>Rhes</i><sup><i>+/−</i></sup>) mice had an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from <i>Rhes</i>-heterozygous mice with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of <i>Rasgrp1</i>, we identified a diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the “Rhesactome,” and determined that RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive disorder), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat–containing 7; a protein associated with bipolar disorder and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large homolog 2; a protein associated with chronic pain). Thus, this Rhes network provides insight into striatal effects of amphetamine and may aid the development of strategies to treat various neurological and psychological disorders associated with the striatal dysfunction.</p>

CRAC channels regulate astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and gliotransmitter release to modulate hippocampal GABAergic transmission
<p>Astrocytes are the major glial subtype in the brain and mediate numerous functions ranging from metabolic support to gliotransmitter release through signaling mechanisms controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Despite intense interest, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathways in astrocytes remain obscure, hindering mechanistic insights into how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is coupled to downstream astrocyte-mediated effector functions. Here, we identified store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels encoded by Orai1 and STIM1 as a major route of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry for driving sustained and oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of metabotropic purinergic and protease-activated receptors. Using synaptopHluorin as an optical reporter, we showed that the opening of astrocyte CRAC channels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated vesicular exocytosis to mediate the release of gliotransmitters, including ATP. Furthermore, slice electrophysiological recordings showed that activation of astrocytes by protease-activated receptors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus to increase inhibitory postsynaptic currents on CA1 pyramidal cells. These results reveal a central role for CRAC channels as regulators of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, gliotransmitter release, and astrocyte-mediated tonic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p>

Inhibition of T cell activation and function by the adaptor protein CIN85
<p>T cell activation is initiated by signaling molecules downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) that are organized by adaptor proteins. CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa) is one such adaptor protein. Here, we showed that CIN85 limited T cell responses to TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Compared to activated wild-type (WT) T cells, those that lacked CIN85 produced more IL-2 and exhibited greater proliferation. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of WT T cells with their cognate antigen, CIN85 was recruited to the TCR signaling complex. Early TCR signaling events, such as phosphorylation of ζ-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (Zap70), Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP76), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk), were enhanced in CIN85-deficient T cells. The inhibitory function of CIN85 required the SH3 and PR regions of the adaptor, which associated with the phosphatase suppressor of TCR signaling–2 (Sts-2) after TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Together, our data suggest that CIN85 is recruited to the TCR signaling complex and mediates inhibition of T cell activation through its association with Sts-2.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock coupling. When these clocks became uncoupled, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation was withdrawn, the clocks again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action potential generation, which was restored by recoupling of the clocks. Clock coupling and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical synapses in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated release of their afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal release of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

IL-2Rβ abundance differentially tunes IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates both activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to proliferate. IL-2 signals through an identical receptor complex and promotes the same dose-dependent phosphorylation of the canonical transcription factor STAT5 in both cell types. Despite this, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enter the S phase earlier and proliferate to a greater extent than do CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to IL-2. We identified distinct IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In IL-2–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, STAT5 phosphorylation increased rapidly and was sustained for 6 hours. In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a biphasic response, with maxima at 15 min and 2 to 4 hours after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Both cell types required vesicular trafficking, but only CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells required new protein synthesis to maintain high phosphorylation of STAT5. Two subunits of the IL-2 receptor, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, were twice as abundant in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Reduction of IL-2Rβ abundance by 50% was sufficient to convert CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell–like signaling pattern and delay S phase entry. These results suggest that the larger pool of IL-2Rβ chains in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is required to sustain IL-2 signaling and contributes to the quantitatively greater proliferative response to IL-2 relative to that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This cell type–specific difference in IL-2Rβ abundance appears to tune responses, potentially preventing extensive, autoimmune proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, while still enabling sufficient proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to control viral infections.</p>

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated fast DC motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels. Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 channel– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent signaling was further required to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

TCR-stimulated changes in cell surface CD46 expression generate type 1 regulatory T cells
<p>A lack of regulatory T cell function is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) effector cells into interleukin-10 (IL-10)–secreting type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation sites. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune synapse switched T cells from producing the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to producing IL-10. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a CD3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of cell surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying the regulatory function of CD46 on T cells. Our findings may explain why this pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS pathogenesis that could help to design future immunotherapies.</p>

ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 inhibitors may be useful for managing pain.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory nerves through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation frequency. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation could reinforce lever-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session.

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional conservation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four conserved novel motifs; however, relatively fewer conserved motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained conserved across plants, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional conservation among diverse plant groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through conserved cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among plants, and suggests their functional conservation.</p>

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-cell responses. The effect of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating factor–producing B cells within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-cell depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune cell activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

Melanocortin 1 Receptor Signaling Regulates Cholesterol Transport in Macrophages
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1-R) is expressed by monocytes and macrophages, where it exerts anti-inflammatory actions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation with its natural ligand α-melanocyte–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone. The present study was designed to investigate the specific role of MC1-R in the context of atherosclerosis and possible regulatory pathways of MC1-R beyond anti-inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Human and mouse atherosclerotic samples and primary mouse macrophages were used to study the regulatory functions of MC1-R. The impact of pharmacological MC1-R activation on atherosclerosis was assessed in apolipoprotein E–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Characterization of human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques revealed that MC1-R expression localizes in lesional macrophages and is significantly associated with the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, which are responsible for initiating reverse cholesterol transport. Using bone marrow–derived macrophages, we observed that α-melanocyte–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone and selective MC1-R agonists similarly promoted cholesterol efflux, which is a counterregulatory mechanism against foam cell formation. Mechanistically, MC1-R activation upregulated the levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in cell surface CD36 expression and in cholesterol uptake, further protecting macrophages from excessive lipid accumulation. Conversely, macrophages deficient in functional MC1-R displayed a phenotype with impaired efflux and enhanced uptake of cholesterol. Pharmacological targeting of MC1-R in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E–deficient mice reduced plasma cholesterol levels and aortic CD36 expression and increased plaque ABCG1 expression and signs of plaque stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify a novel role for MC1-R in macrophage cholesterol transport. Activation of MC1-R confers protection against macrophage foam cell formation through a dual mechanism: It prevents cholesterol uptake while concomitantly promoting ABCA1- and ABCG1-mediated reverse cholesterol transport.</p></sec>

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape behavior in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

The cerebellum gets social
<p>The cerebellum contains the second main cortex of the brain and ∼50% of the neurons that constitute the brain. Although the cerebellum has long been thought to subserve motor learning and coordination, more recently it has been recognized to take part in cognitive and emotional processing. Additionally, evidence for cerebellar involvement in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and addiction is growing. On page 248 of this issue, Carta <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) extend this theme and show that the cerebellum can activate the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA is a mesencephalic nucleus giving rise to the mesocortical and mesolimbic fiber bundles that release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e to the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e, in turn, plays a fundamental role in cognitive and emotional functioning by regulating motivation and reward. This places the cerebellum into the main circuits regulating brain states and social behavior.</p>

A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles
<p>Neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) form tight clusters at synapses. These clusters act as a reservoir from which SVs are drawn for exocytosis during sustained activity. Several components associated with SVs that are likely to help form such clusters have been reported, including synapsin. Here we found that synapsin can form a distinct liquid phase in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this condensate but were not necessary for its formation. Importantly, the synapsin phase could capture small lipid vesicles. The synapsin phase rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, mimicking the dispersion of synapsin 1 that occurs at presynaptic sites upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Thus, principles of liquid-liquid phase separation may apply to the clustering of SVs at synapses.</p>

Phase changes in neurotransmission
<p>Clusters of synaptic vesicles (SVs) are distinctive features of axon terminals in neurons. SVs contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers that are released upon electrical activity. The discovery of SVs as defined packages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers provided the molecular basis for the quantized theory of synaptic transmission in discrete units of information (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). It has remained enigmatic what holds these vesicles together in clusters. On page 604 of this issue, Milovanovic <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that synapsin 1, a protein that is essential for SV cluster formation, condenses into liquid droplets in vitro. Lipid vesicles and other SV cluster components specifically partition into these condensates, suggesting that SV cluster formation occurs through protein phase separation.</p>

Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells amplify allergic asthma responses
<p>Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are rare airway epithelial cells whose function is poorly understood. Here we show that <i>Ascl1</i>-mutant mice that have no PNECs exhibit severely blunted mucosal type 2 response in models of allergic asthma. PNECs reside in close proximity to group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) near airway branch points. PNECs act through calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate ILC2s and elicit downstream immune responses. In addition, PNECs act through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to induce goblet cell hyperplasia. The instillation of a mixture of CGRP and GABA in <i>Ascl1</i>-mutant airways restores both immune and goblet cell responses. In accordance, lungs from human asthmatics show increased PNECs. These findings demonstrate that the PNEC-ILC2 neuroimmunological modules function at airway branch points to amplify allergic asthma responses.</p>

Evidence for a neural law of effect
<p>Thorndike’s law of effect states that actions that lead to reinforcements tend to be repeated more often. Accordingly, neural activity patterns leading to reinforcement are also reentered more frequently. Reinforcement relies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and animals shape their behavior to receive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Seeking evidence for a neural law of effect, we found that mice learn to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity patterns that trigger optogenetic VTA self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Learning was accompanied by gradual shaping of these patterns, with participating neurons progressively increasing and aligning their covariance to that of the target pattern. Motor cortex patterns that lead to phasic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic VTA activity are progressively reinforced and shaped, suggesting a mechanism by which animals select and shape actions to reliably achieve reinforcement.</p>

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system
<p>Age-associated decline in regeneration capacity limits the restoration of nervous system functionality after injury. In a model for demyelination, we found that old mice fail to resolve the inflammatory response initiated after myelin damage. Aged phagocytes accumulated excessive amounts of myelin debris, which triggered cholesterol crystal formation and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated inflammasomes. Myelin debris clearance required cholesterol transporters, including apolipoprotein E. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of reverse cholesterol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity of old mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. Thus, cholesterol-rich myelin debris can overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of cholesterol into crystals and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that impedes tissue regeneration.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate deep brain neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated ion channels, which cause them to become excited upon illumination (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitation: Light-gated ion channels are typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation, focused on small regions, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated ion channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applications to optically control neuronal dysfunctions, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

Nerves switch on angiogenic metabolism
<p>Nerves release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers to regulate most physiologic functions in the body. Recently, it has been recognized that nerves play dominant roles in organogenesis and tissue regeneration (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, growing evidence suggests that cancer development in a variety of tissues is controlled by an assortment of nerve-mediated signals, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and other molecules (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>). The key molecules depend on the organ and the context, but the targets of neurotransmission appear to include both stem cells and the surrounding stromal cells. Both adrenergic and cholinergic nerves promote prostate cancer development, at least in part, by activating stromal cells (<i>4</i>). On page 321 of this issue, Zahalka <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) expand on their previous findings (<i>3</i>) by elucidating the molecular mechanism of neurotransmission in prostate cancer, revealing that noradrenaline released from cancer-associated nerves triggers angiogenesis and thus cancer progression.</p>

Activity-dependent spatially localized miRNA maturation in neuronal dendrites
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation. In general, the number of potential mRNA targets in a cell is much greater than the miRNA copy number, complicating high-fidelity miRNA-target interactions. We developed an inducible fluorescent probe to explore whether the maturation of a miRNA could be regulated in space and time in neurons. A precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) probe exhibited an activity-dependent increase in fluorescence, suggesting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of miRNA maturation. Single-synapse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation resulted in a local maturation of miRNA that was associated with a spatially restricted reduction in the protein synthesis of a target mRNA. Thus, the spatially and temporally regulated maturation of pre-miRNAs can be used to increase the precision and robustness of miRNA-mediated translational repression.</p>

β-cell–mimetic designer cells provide closed-loop glycemic control
<p>Chronically deregulated blood-glucose concentrations in diabetes mellitus result from a loss of pancreatic insulin-producing β cells (type 1 diabetes, T1D) or from impaired insulin sensitivity of body cells and glucose-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated insulin release (type 2 diabetes, T2D). Here, we show that therapeutically applicable β-cell–mimetic designer cells can be established by minimal engineering of human cells. We achieved glucose responsiveness by a synthetic circuit that couples glycolysis-mediated calcium entry to an excitation-transcription system controlling therapeutic transgene expression. Implanted circuit-carrying cells corrected insulin deficiency and self-sufficiently abolished persistent hyperglycemia in T1D mice. Similarly, glucose-inducible glucagon-like peptide 1 transcription improved endogenous glucose-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated insulin release and glucose tolerance in T2D mice.

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are learned through trial and error by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–projecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>e activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopamin</span></strong>ergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learned for reward and are instead learned by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

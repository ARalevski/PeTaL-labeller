Dimerization in LBD16 and LBD18 Transcription Factors Is Critical for Lateral Root Formation
<p>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKEs (hereafter referred to as LBD) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in a plethora of plant growth and development. The leucine (Leu) zipper-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> motif in the lateral organ boundaries domain of the class I LBD proteins has been proposed to mediate protein dimerization, but it has not been experimentally assessed yet. LBD16 and LBD18 have been well characterized to play important roles in lateral root development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we investigated the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> motif in the dimerization of LBD16 and LBD18 and in transcriptional regulation and biological function. We built the molecular models of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> of LBD16 and LBD18, providing the probable Leu zipper models of the helix dimer. Using a variety of molecular techniques, such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, GST pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the conserved Leu or valine residues in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> motif are critical for the dimerization of LBD16 or LBD18. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress HA:LBD16 or HA:LBD16<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd16</i> or HA:LBD18 or HA:LBD18<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd18</i>, we demonstrated that the homodimerization of LBD18 mediated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> motif is crucial for transcriptional regulation via promoter binding and for lateral root formation. In addition, we found that the carboxyl-terminal region beyond the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> motif in LBD18 acts as an additional dimerization domain. These results provide a molecular basis for homodimerization and heterodimerization among the 42 Arabidopsis LBD family members for displaying their biological functions.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation provides a rational template to implement plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Oncogenic RAS isoforms show a hierarchical requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS2 to mediate cell transformation
<p>About a third of tumors have activating mutations in <i>HRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, or <i>KRAS</i>, genes encoding guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS family. In these tumors, wild-type RAS cooperates with mutant RAS to promote downstream effector activation and cell proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, suggesting that upstream activators of wild-type RAS are important modulators of mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 mediates KRAS-driven proliferation, but little is understood about the role of SOS2. We found that RAS family members have a hierarchical requirement for the expression and activity of SOS2 to drive cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. <i>Sos2</i> deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent activation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation required the GEF activity of SOS2 and was restored in <i>Sos2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> MEFs by expression of constitutively activated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>SOS2</i> reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed phenotype of human <i>KRAS</i> mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.</p>

Cytosolic DNA Sensing Promotes Macrophage Transformation and Governs Myocardial Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardium irreversibly injured by ischemic stress must be efficiently repaired to maintain tissue integrity and contractile performance. Macrophages play critical roles in this process. These cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong> across a spectrum of phenotypes to accomplish diverse functions ranging from mediating the initial inflammatory responses that clear damaged tissue to subsequent reparative functions that help rebuild replacement tissue. Although macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation is crucial to myocardial repair, events governing this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we set out to determine whether innate immune responses triggered by cytoplasmic DNA play a role.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report that ischemic myocardial injury, along with the resulting release of nucleic acids, activates the recently described cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Animals lacking cyclic GMP-AMP synthase display significantly improved early survival after myocardial infarction and diminished pathological remodeling, including ventricular rupture, enhanced angiogenesis, and preserved ventricular contractile function. Furthermore, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase loss of function abolishes the induction of key inflammatory programs such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation of macrophages to a reparative phenotype, which results in enhanced repair and improved hemodynamic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal, for the first time, that the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase functions during cardiac ischemia as a pattern recognition receptor in the sterile immune response.

Multiepitope tissue analysis reveals SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation as a key step in the transformation of melanocytes
<p>The evolution of cancer is characterized by the appearance of specific mutations, but these mutations are translated into proteins that must cooperate to induce malignant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. Using a systemic approach with the multiepitope ligand cartography (MELC) technology, we analyzed protein expression profiles (PEPs) in nevi and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-positive superficial spreading melanomas (SSMs) from patient tissues to identify key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation events. The PEPs in nevi and SSMs differed predominantly in the abundance of specific antigens, but the PEPs of nevi- and melanoma-associated keratinocytes gradually changed during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation process. A stepwise change in PEP with similar properties occurred in keratinocytes cocultured with melanoma cells. Analysis of the individual steps indicated that activation of the metalloproteinase ADAM10 by signal peptide peptidase–like 3 (SPPL3) triggered by mutant BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> was a critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation event. SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation involved the translocation of SPPL3 and ADAM10 into Rab4- or Rab27-positive endosomal compartments. This endosomal translocation, and hence ADAM10 activation, was inhibited by the presence of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Our findings suggest that systematic tissue antigen analysis could complement whole-genome approaches to provide more insight into cancer development.</p>

Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity
<p>Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) perceive pathogen effectors to trigger plant immunity. Biochemical mechanisms underlying plant NLR activation have until now remained poorly understood. We reconstituted an active complex containing the <i>Arabidopsis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> NLR ZAR1, the pseudokinase RKS1, uridylated protein kinase PBL2, and 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (dATP), demonstrating the oligomerization of the complex during immune activation. The cryo–electron microscopy structure reveals a wheel-like pentameric ZAR1 resistosome. Besides the nucleotide-binding domain, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> domain of ZAR1 also contributes to resistosome pentamerization by forming an α-helical barrel that interacts with the leucine-rich repeat and winged-helix domains. Structural remodeling and fold switching during activation release the very N-terminal amphipathic α helix of ZAR1 to form a funnel-shaped structure that is required for the plasma membrane association, cell death triggering, and disease resistance, offering clues to the biochemical function of a plant resistosome.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation) with first order (isomerization-like) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation system.</p>

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall shear stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and arterial stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on arterial stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow stiffens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical testing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall shear stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-flow and stable flow were tested ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced arterial stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo testing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial stiffening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in shear-mediated arterial stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit arterial stiffening and the progression of disease in arteries exposed to d-flow.</p></sec>

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor

Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA pressures and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an area under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure.

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material.

The late-time light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

We report, at telecommunication wavelengths, geometry-independent and integrated nonreciprocal topological cavities that couple stimulated emission from one-way photonic edge states to a selected waveguide output with an isolation ratio in excess of 10 decibels. Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants.

Quantitative 3D evolution of colloidal nanoparticle oxidation in solution
<p>Real-time tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of colloidal nanoparticles in solution is essential for understanding complex mechanisms involved in nanoparticle growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. We used time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering simultaneously to monitor oxidation of highly uniform colloidal iron nanoparticles, enabling the reconstruction of intermediate 3D morphologies of the nanoparticles with a spatial resolution of <i>~</i>5 angstroms. The in situ observations, combined with large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations, reveal the details of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation from solid metal nanoparticles to hollow metal oxide nanoshells via a nanoscale Kirkendall process—for example, coalescence of voids as they grow and reversal of mass diffusion direction depending on crystallinity. Our results highlight the complex interplay between defect chemistry and defect dynamics in determining nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation and formation.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ed β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ature would allow design of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ed β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ed hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA flexes to form the variably <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ed core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene cones, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with oxidative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via oxidation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the oxidation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly oxidized to yield oxidized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the oxidation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the risk of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using area under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the derivation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology death.

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es. LV stiffness was calculated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e fit of the diastolic pressure-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

J Curve in Patients Randomly Assigned to Different Systolic Blood Pressure Targets
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Low systolic blood pressure (SBP) values are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, giving rise to the so-called J-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e phenomenon. We assessed the association between on-treatment SBP levels, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to different SBP targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from 2 large randomized trials that randomly allocated hypertensive patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease to intensive (SBP<120 mm Hg) or conventional (SBP<140 mm Hg) treatment were pooled and harmonized for outcomes and follow-up duration. Using natural cubic splines, we plotted the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events against the mean on-treatment SBP per treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The pooled data consisted of 194 875 on-treatment SBP measurements in 13 946 patients (98.9%). During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For both blood pressure targets, an identical shape of the J <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP target. Patients in the lowest SBP stratum were older, had a higher body mass index, smoked more often, and had a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low on-treatment SBP levels are associated with increased cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This association is independent of the attained blood pressure level because the J <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e aligns with the SBP target.

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits pressure overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pressure overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the bone marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Pressure overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in pressure-overloaded myocardium. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that IL10 suppresses Smad–miRNA-21–mediated activation of BM-FPCs and thus modulates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large arrays of individually controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications.

Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral atoms in tunable two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es.</p>

Dynamic creation and evolution of gradient nanostructure in single-crystal metallic microcubes

Extreme nanostructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations are imposed by high strain rates, strain gradients, and recrystallization in high-velocity impacts of the microcubes against an impenetrable substrate. We synthesized the silver microcubes in a bottom-up seed-growth process and use an advanced laser-induced projectile impact testing apparatus to selectively launch them at supersonic velocities (~400 meters per second). Our study provides new insights into the fundamental deformation mechanisms and the effects of crystal and sample-shape symmetries resulting from high-velocity impacts. The nanostructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations produced in our experiments show promising pathways to developing gradient nanograined metals for engineering applications requiring both high strength and high toughness—for example, in structural components of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated resistance in cultivated barley enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular immune receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered immunity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding domain (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an amino-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> (CC) domain. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by interdomain interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC domain in regulating Rx1 activity or immune signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC domain in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC domain acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered immunity. Systematic disruption of the hydrophobic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease resistance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated resistance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-terminal half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated resistance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease resistance or cell death signaling.</p>

Identification of ASYNAPTIC4, a Component of the Meiotic Chromosome Axis
<p>During the leptotene stage of prophase I of meiosis, chromatids become organized into a linear looped array via a protein axis that forms along the loop bases. Establishment of the axis is essential for the subsequent synapsis of the homologous chromosome pairs and the progression of recombination to form genetic crossovers. Here, we describe ASYNAPTIC4 (ASY4), a meiotic axis protein in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ASY4 is a small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> protein that exhibits limited sequence similarity with the carboxyl-terminal region of the axis protein ASY3. We used enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged ASY4 to show that ASY4 localizes to the chromosome axis throughout prophase I. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that ASY4 interacts with ASY1 and ASY3, and yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed a direct interaction between ASY4 and ASY3. Mutants lacking full-length ASY4 exhibited defective axis formation and were unable to complete synapsis. Although the initiation of recombination appeared to be unaffected in the <i>asy4</i> mutant, the number of crossovers was reduced significantly, and crossovers tended to group in the distal parts of the chromosomes. We conclude that ASY4 is required for normal axis and crossover formation. Furthermore, our data suggest that ASY3/ASY4 are the functional homologs of the mammalian SYCP2/SYCP3 axial components.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and lipid synthesis controlled by lipid signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Distinct Functions of STARCH SYNTHASE 4 Domains in Starch Granule Formation
<p>The formation of normal starch granules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf chloroplasts requires STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4). In plants lacking SS4, chloroplasts typically produce only one round granule rather than multiple lenticular granules. The mechanisms by which SS4 determines granule number and morphology are not understood. The N-terminal region of SS4 is unique among SS isoforms and contains several long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> motifs, typically implicated in protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal region contains the catalytic glucosyltransferase domains, which are widely conserved in plant SS and bacterial glycogen synthase (GS) isoforms. We investigated the specific roles of the N- and C-terminal regions of SS4 by expressing truncated versions of SS4 and a fusion between the N-terminal region of SS4 and GS in the Arabidopsis <i>ss4</i> mutant. Expression of the N-terminal region of SS4 alone did not alter the <i>ss4</i> mutant phenotype. Expression of the C-terminal region of SS4 alone increased granule initiation but did not rescue their aberrant round morphology. Expression of a self-priming GS from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> also increased the number of round granules. Remarkably, fusion of the N-terminal region of SS4 to <i>A. tumefaciens</i> GS restored the development of wild-type-like lenticular starch granules. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of SS4 alone or when fused to GS conferred a patchy subchloroplastic localization similar to that of the full-length SS4 protein. Considered together, these data suggest that, while the glucosyltransferase activity of SS4 is important for granule initiation, the N-terminal part of SS4 serves to establish the correct granule morphology by properly localizing this activity.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

A uORF Represses the Transcription Factor AtHB1 in Aerial Tissues to Avoid a Deleterious Phenotype
<p>AtHB1 is an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor that participates in hypocotyl elongation under short-day conditions. Here, we show that its expression is posttranscriptionally regulated by an upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in its 5′ untranslated region. This uORF encodes a highly conserved peptide (CPuORF) that is present in varied monocot and dicot species. The Arabidopsis uORF and its maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) homolog repressed the translation of the main open reading frame in cis, independent of the sequence of the latter. Published ribosome footprinting results and the analysis of a frame-shifted uORF, in which the repression capability was lost, indicated that the uORF causes ribosome stalling. The regulation exerted by the CPuORF was tissue specific and did not act in the absence of light. Moreover, a photosynthetic signal is needed for the CPuORF action, since plants with uncoupled chloroplasts did not show uORF-dependent repression. Plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with the native <i>AtHB1</i> promoter driving <i>AtHB1</i> expression did not show differential phenotypes, whereas those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with a construct in which the uORF was mutated exhibited serrated leaves, compact rosettes, and, most significantly, short nondehiscent anthers and siliques containing fewer or no seeds. Thus, we propose that the uncontrolled expression of <i>AtHB1</i> is deleterious for the plant and, hence, finely repressed by a translational mechanism.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate immunity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress immunity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced immunity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 immune pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for immunity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce immunity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the immune signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

Antiviral Resistance Protein Tm-2<sup>2</sup> Functions on the Plasma Membrane

Tm-2<sup>2</sup> confers plant extreme resistance against tobamoviruses including <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) by recognizing the avirulence (Avr) viral movement protein (MP). However, the subcellular compartment where Tm-2<sup>2</sup> functions is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Tm-2<sup>2</sup> interacts with TMV MP to form a protein complex at the PM. We show that both inactive and active Tm-2<sup>2</sup> proteins are localized to the PM. When restricted to PM by fusing Tm-2<sup>2</sup> to the <i>S</i>-acylated PM association motif, the Tm-2<sup>2</sup> fusion protein can still induce a hypersensitive response cell death, consistent with its activation at the PM. Through analyses of viral MP mutants, we find that the plasmodesmata (PD) localization of the Avr protein MP is not required for Tm-2<sup>2</sup> function. These results suggest that Tm-2<sup>2</sup>-mediated resistance takes place on PM without requirement of its Avr protein to be located to PD.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>ature factor when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR stability is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA stability is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong>ed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coil</span></strong> domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the stability of MLA immune receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>e was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at revision THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a mean follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-operative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   operating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a mean age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a mean body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es were classified according to Lenke; 40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">curv</span></strong>es were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-operatively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-operatively with   a mean correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001). The mean   kyphosis at T5 to T12 increased from 24.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.2°) pre-operatively   to 30.1° (<sc>sd</sc> 9.6°,    p < 0.001) post-operatively. Peri-operative (30 days) complications   occurred in three patients(4.2%): one subcutaneous haematoma, one   deep venous thrombosis and one pulmonary complication. Five additional complications   occurred in five patients (7.1%): one superficial wound infection,   one suture granuloma and three delayed deep surgical site infections.   The mean ORT was 337.1 mins (<sc>sd</sc> 121.3); the mean EBL was   345.7 ml (<sc>sd</sc> 175.1) and the mean LOS was 4.6 days (<sc>sd</sc> 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of MIS for patients with AIS results in a significant   correction of spinal deformity in both the frontal and sagittal   planes, with a low EBL and a short LOS. The rate of peri-operative   complications compares well with that following a routine open technique.   The longer term safety and benefit of MIS in these patients needs   to be evaluated with further follow-up of a larger cohort of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1651–7.</p></sec>

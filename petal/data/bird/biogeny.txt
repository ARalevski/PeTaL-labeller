Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to estimates of rates of phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, and many comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for each family is unresolved.

Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

Antibiotic tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance
<p>Controlled experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion during antibiotic treatment can help to explain the processes leading to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Recently, intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of tolerance—that is, the ability to survive under treatment without developing resistance. However, whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of resistance is unclear. Here we used in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded resistance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for resistance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of resistance. Preventing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of resistance.</p>

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, we investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with conserved sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as well as between selection pressure on coding sequences of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion as well as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

Evolution of Protein Domain Repeats in Metazoa
<p>Repeats are ubiquitous elements of proteins and they play important roles for cellular function and during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. Repeats are, however, also notoriously difficult to capture computationally and large scale studies so far had difficulties in linking genetic causes, structural properties and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary trajectories of protein repeats. Here we apply recently developed methods for repeat detection and analysis to a large dataset comprising over hundred metazoan genomes. We find that repeats in larger protein families experience generally very few insertions or deletions (indels) of repeat units but there is also a significant fraction of noteworthy volatile outliers with very high indel rates. Analysis of structural data indicates that repeats with an open structure and independently folding units are more volatile and more likely to be intrinsically disordered. Such disordered repeats are also significantly enriched in sites with a high functional potential such as linear motifs. Furthermore, the most volatile repeats have a high sequence similarity between their units. Since many volatile repeats also show signs of recombination, we conclude they are often shaped by concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. Intriguingly, many of these conserved yet volatile repeats are involved in host-pathogen interactions where they might foster fast but subtle adaptation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical arms races.</p><p><bold><i>Key Words</i>:</bold> protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, domain rearrangements, protein repeats, concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion in this lineage.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

DNA fragility in the parallel evolution of pelvic reduction in stickleback fish
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion generates a remarkable breadth of living forms, but many traits evolve repeatedly, by mechanisms that are still poorly understood. A classic example of repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion is the loss of pelvic hindfins in stickleback fish (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>). Repeated pelvic loss maps to recurrent deletions of a pelvic enhancer of the <i>Pitx1</i> gene. Here, we identify molecular features contributing to these recurrent deletions. <i>Pitx1</i> enhancer sequences form alternative DNA structures in vitro and increase double-strand breaks and deletions in vivo. Enhancer mutability depends on DNA replication direction and is caused by TG-dinucleotide repeats. Modeling shows that elevated mutation rates can influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion under demographic conditions relevant for sticklebacks and humans. DNA fragility may thus help explain why the same loci are often used repeatedly during parallel adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.</p>

Natural selection and the predictability of evolution in <i>Timema</i> stick insects
<p>Predicting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion remains difficult. We studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of cryptic body coloration and pattern in a stick insect using 25 years of field data, experiments, and genomics. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple selective factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions than when it involves feedback loops that cause consistent back-and-forth fluctuations. Specifically, changes in color-morph frequencies are modestly predictable through time (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.14) and driven by complex selective regimes and yearly fluctuations in climate. In contrast, temporal changes in pattern-morph frequencies are highly predictable due to negative frequency-dependent selection (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.86). For both traits, however, natural selection drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion around a dynamic equilibrium, providing some predictability to the process.</p>

Decoupled ecomorphological evolution and diversification in Neogene-Quaternary horses

We show that diversification pulses are a recurrent feature of equid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion but that these pulses are not correlated with rapid bursts in phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. Instead, rapid cladogenesis seems repeatedly associated with extrinsic factors that relaxed diversity bounds, such as increasing productivity and geographic dispersals into the Old World. This evidence suggests that diversity dynamics in Equinae were controlled mainly by ecological limits under diversity dependence rather than rapid ecomorphological differentiation.</p>

Evolutionary drivers of thermoadaptation in enzyme catalysis

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp.

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of the observed DEGs using established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Loss of the Chloroplast Transit Peptide from an Ancestral C<sub>3</sub> Carbonic Anhydrase Is Associated with C<sub>4</sub> Evolution in the Grass Genus <i>Neurachne</i>
<p><i>Neurachne</i> is the only known grass lineage containing closely related C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> species, making it an ideal taxon with which to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in the grasses. To begin dissecting the molecular changes that led to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in this group, the complementary DNAs encoding four distinct β-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms were characterized from leaf tissue of <i>Neurachne munroi</i> (C<sub>4</sub>), <i>Neurachne minor</i> (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>), and <i>Neurachne alopecuroidea</i> (C<sub>3</sub>). Two genes (<i>CA1</i> and <i>CA2</i>) each encode two different isoforms: CA1a/CA1b and CA2a/CA2b. Transcript analyses found that <i>CA1</i> messenger RNAs were significantly more abundant than transcripts from the <i>CA2</i> gene in the leaves of each species examined, constituting ∼99% of all β-CA transcripts measured. Localization experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs showed that, while CA1b is a cytosolic CA in all three species, the CA1a proteins are differentially localized. The <i>N. alopecuroidea</i> and <i>N. minor</i> CA1a isoforms were imported into chloroplasts of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf cells, whereas <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a localized to the cytosol. Sequence analysis indicated an 11-amino acid deletion in the amino terminus of <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a relative to the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> proteins, suggesting that chloroplast targeting of CA1a is the ancestral state and that loss of a functional chloroplast transit peptide in <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a is associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in <i>Neurachne</i> spp. Remarkably, this mechanism is homoplastic with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of the C<sub>4</sub>-associated CA in the dicotyledonous genus <i>Flaveria</i>, although the actual mutations in the two lineages differ.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary forces shape the structural and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of these clusters is hindered by the high sequence identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel sequencing data, we studied the organization, sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read sequencing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

Gene Tree Discordance Can Generate Patterns of Diminishing Convergence over Time
<p>Phenotypic convergence is an exciting outcome of adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, occurring when different species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the molecular basis of convergence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing convergence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an alternative cause of changes in convergence levels over time in a primate dataset. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce patterns of diminishing convergence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent convergence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of molecular convergence in primates. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical discordance is not possible, discordance due to errors in species tree inference can drive similar patterns. Though intramolecular epistasis could in principle create a pattern of declining convergence over time, our results suggest a possible alternative explanation for this widespread pattern. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene tree discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger positive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion and overlap extensively with positively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

The Evolution of Male–Female Sexual Dimorphism Predates the Gender-Based Divergence of the Mating Locus Gene <i>MAT3/RB</i>
<p>The molecular bases for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of male–female sexual dimorphism are possible to study in volvocine algae because they encompass the entire range of reproductive morphologies from isogamy to oogamy. In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene becoming linked to the sex-determining or mating type locus (<i>MT</i>) as a mechanism for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of anisogamy. Here, we carried out the first comprehensive study of a candidate <i>MT-</i>linked oogamy gene, <i>MAT3/RB</i>, across the volvocine lineage. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of anisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high male–female divergence of <i>MAT3</i> that characterizes the <i>Volvox carteri</i> lineage. These data demonstrate very little sex-linked sequence divergence of <i>MAT3</i> between the two sexes in other volvocine groups, though linkage between <i>MAT3</i> and the mating locus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants other than or in addition to <i>MAT3</i> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of anisogamy in volvocine algae.</p>

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling proteins evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G protein (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding protein) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G protein machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G protein signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the protein to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG proteins evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG proteins all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of residues among interacting proteins.</p>

Dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 is crucial for murine sperm maturation in vivo
<p>The posttranslational modification of histones is crucial in spermatogenesis, as in other tissues; however, during spermiogenesis, histones are replaced with protamines, which are critical for the tight packaging of the DNA in sperm cells. Protamines are also posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which prompted our investigation of the underlying mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical consequences of their regulation. On the basis of a screen that implicated the heat shock protein Hspa4l in spermatogenesis, we generated mice deficient in Hspa4l (<i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice), which showed male infertility and the malformation of sperm heads. These phenotypes are similar to those of <i>Ppp1cc</i>-deficient mice, and we found that the amount of a testis- and sperm-specific isoform of the Ppp1cc phosphatase (Ppp1cc2) in the chromatin-binding fraction was substantially less in <i>Hspa4l</i>-null spermatozoa than that in those of wild-type mice. We further showed that Ppp1cc2 was a substrate of the chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 and that Hspa4l enhanced the release of Ppp1cc2 from these complexes, enabling the freed Ppp1cc2 to localize to chromatin. Pull-down and in vitro phosphatase assays suggested the dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 (Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup>) by Ppp1cc2. To confirm the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical importance of Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup> dephosphorylation, we mutated Ser<sup>56</sup> to alanine in Prm2 (Prm2 S56A). Introduction of this mutation to <i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice (<i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup>; <i>Prm2</i><sup>S56A/S56A</sup>) restored the malformation of sperm heads and the infertility of <i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The dephosphorylation signal to eliminate phosphate was crucial, and these results unveiled the mechanism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical relevance of the dephosphorylation of Prm2 for sperm maturation in vivo.</p>

Convergent regulatory evolution and loss of flight in paleognathous birds
<p>A core question in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y is whether convergent phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion is driven by convergent molecular changes in proteins or regulatory regions. We combined phylogenomic, developmental, and epigenomic analysis of 11 new genomes of paleognathous birds, including an extinct moa, to show that convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of regulatory regions, more so than protein-coding genes, is prevalent among developmental pathways associated with independent losses of flight. A Bayesian analysis of 284,001 conserved noncoding elements, 60,665 of which are corroborated as enhancers by open chromatin states during development, identified 2355 independent accelerations along lineages of flightless paleognaths, with functional consequences for driving gene expression in the developing forelimb. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape associated with morphological convergence in ratites has a substantial shared regulatory component.</p>

Pan-tumor genomic biomarkers for PD-1 checkpoint blockade–based immunotherapy

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. Our findings suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Insights into the Evolution of Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins from 1000 Plant Transcriptomes
<p>The carbohydrate-rich cell walls of land plants and algae have been the focus of much interest given the value of cell wall-based products to our current and future economies. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), a major group of wall glycoproteins, play important roles in plant growth and development, yet little is known about how they have evolved in parallel with the polysaccharide components of walls. We investigate the origins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of the HRGP superfamily, which is commonly divided into three major multigene families: the arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs), and proline-rich proteins. Using motif and amino acid bias, a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified HRGPs in sequences from the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>). Our analyses provide new insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of HRGPs across major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary milestones, including the transition to land and the early radiation of angiosperms. Significantly, data mining reveals the origin of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored AGPs in green algae and a 3- to 4-fold increase in GPI-AGPs in liverworts and mosses. The first detection of cross-linking (CL)-EXTs is observed in bryophytes, which suggests that CL-EXTs arose though the juxtaposition of preexisting SP<sub>n</sub> EXT glycomotifs with refined Y-based motifs. We also detected the loss of CL-EXT in a few lineages, including the grass family (Poaceae), that have a cell wall composition distinct from other monocots and eudicots. A key challenge in HRGP research is tracking individual HRGPs throughout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. Using the 1000 Plants output, we were able to find putative orthologs of Arabidopsis pollen-specific GPI-AGPs in basal eudicots.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques
<p>Hybridization has played an important role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of many lineages. With the growing availability of genomic tools and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic tools are r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion, molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, disease genetics, and conservation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion and expression. Here, we chart the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

Genesis and Regulatory Wiring of Retroelement-Derived Domesticated Genes: A Phylogenomic Perspective
<p>Molecular domestications of transposable elements have occurred repeatedly during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of eukaryotes. Vertebrates, especially mammals, possess numerous single copy domesticated genes (DGs) that have originated from the intronless multicopy transposable elements. However, the origin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of the retroelement-derived DGs (RDDGs) that originated from Metaviridae has been only partially elucidated, due to absence of genome data or to limited analysis of a single family of DGs. We traced the genesis and regulatory wiring of the Metaviridae-derived DGs through phylogenomic analysis, using whole-genome information from more than 90 chordate genomes. Phylogenomic analysis of these DGs in chordate genomes provided direct evidence that major diversification has occurred in the ancestor of placental mammals. Mammalian RDDGs have been shown to originate in several steps by independent domestication events and to diversify later by gene duplications. Analysis of syntenic loci has shown that diverse RDDGs and their chromosomal positions were fully established in the ancestor of placental mammals. By analysis of active Metaviridae lineages in amniotes, we have demonstrated that RDDGs originated from retroelement remains. The chromosomal gene movements of RDDGs were highly dynamic only in the ancestor of placental mammals. During the domestication process, de novo acquisition of regulatory regions is shown to be a prerequisite for the survival of the DGs. The origin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of de novo acquired promoters and untranslated regions in diverse mammalian RDDGs have been explained by comparative analysis of orthologous gene loci. The origin of placental mammal-specific innovations and adaptations, such as placenta and newly evolved brain functions, was most probably connected to the regulatory wiring of DGs and their rapid fixation in the ancestor of placental mammals.</p>

Synovial calprotectin
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Recently, several synovial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers have been introduced into   the algorithm for the diagnosis of a prosthetic joint infection   (PJI). Alpha defensin is a promising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>er, with a high sensitivity   and specificity, but it is expensive. Calprotectin is a protein   that is present in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, is released upon   neutrophil activation and exhibits anti-microbial activity. Our   aim, in this study, was to determine the diagnostic potential of   synovial calprotectin in the diagnosis of a PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this pilot study, we prospectively collected synovial fluid   from the hip, knee, shoulder and elbow of 19 patients with a proven   PJI and from a control group of 42 patients who underwent revision   surgery without a PJI.</p><p>PJI was diagnosed according to the current diagnostic criteria   of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society.

A draft genome of the brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i>, S-strain: a platform for future studies of ‘mozuku’ biology
<p>The brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> (Okinawa mozuku), is economically one of the most important edible seaweeds, and is cultivated for market primarily in Okinawa, Japan. <i>C. okamuranus</i> constitutes a significant source of fucoidan, which has various physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activities. To facilitate studies of seaweed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, we decoded the draft genome of <i>C. okamuranus</i> S-strain. The genome size of <i>C. okamuranus</i> was estimated as ∼140 Mbp, smaller than genomes of two other brown algae, <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i> and <i>Saccharina japonica</i>. Sequencing with ∼100× coverage yielded an assembly of 541 scaffolds with N50 = 416 kbp. Together with transcriptomic data, we estimated that the <i>C. okamuranus</i> genome contains 13,640 protein-coding genes, approximately 94% of which have been confirmed with corresponding mRNAs. Comparisons with the <i>E. siliculosus</i> genome identified a set of <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes that encode enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for sulfated fucans and alginate biosynthesis. In addition, we identified <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes for enzymes involved in phlorotannin biosynthesis.

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>er of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>er sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells.

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events

Baseline HDL particle number was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08). Twelve months of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average percentage change −1.5%, 95% CI, −13.3 to +10.2; <i>P</i>=0.80), but increased HDL cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL particle number (+5.2%). On-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was inversely associated with incident CVD (OR/SD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.92; <i>P</i>=0.02), although HDL particle number again emerged as the strongest predictor (OR/SD, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.77; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In JUPITER, cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with incident CVD in individuals on potent statin therapy but not at baseline.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Membrane Proteomic Insights into the Physiology and Taxonomy of an Oleaginous Green Microalga
<p><i>Ettlia</i> <i>oleoabundans</i> is a nonsequenced oleaginous green microalga. Despite the significant biotechnological interest in producing value-added compounds from the acyl lipids of this microalga, a basic understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of oleaginous microalgae is lacking, especially under nitrogen deprivation conditions known to trigger lipid accumulation. Using an RNA sequencing-based proteomics approach together with manual annotation, we are able to provide, to our knowledge, the first membrane proteome of an oleaginous microalga. This approach allowed the identification of novel proteins in <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including two photoprotection-related proteins, Photosystem II Subunit S and Maintenance of Photosystem II under High Light1, which were considered exclusive to higher photosynthetic organisms, as well as Retinitis Pigmentosa Type 2-Clathrin Light Chain, a membrane protein with a novel domain architecture. Free-flow zonal electrophoresis of microalgal membranes coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proved to be a useful technique for determining the intracellular location of proteins of interest. Carbon-flow compartmentalization in <i>E. oleoabundans</i> was modeled using this information. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of protein markers and 18S ribosomal DNA support the reclassification of <i>E. oleoabundans</i> within the trebouxiophycean microalgae, rather than with the Chlorophyceae class, in which it is currently classified, indicating that it may not be closely related to the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. A detailed survey of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes taking place in the membranes of nitrogen-deprived <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including lipid metabolism, provides insights into the basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y of this nonmodel organism.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ionarily correlated with WR. The identified gene families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evolut</span></strong>ion has involved a general elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations in molecules and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation) with first order (isomerization-like) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

Ultrafast disordering of vanadium dimers in photoexcited VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>Many ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions are treated as chemical reactions that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong> the structures between two different unit cells along a reaction coordinate, but this neglects the role of disorder. Although ultrafast diffraction provides insights into atomic dynamics during such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations, diffraction alone probes an averaged unit cell and is less sensitive to randomness in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion pathway. Using total scattering of femtosecond x-ray pulses, we show that atomic disordering in photoexcited vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) is central to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion mechanism and that, after photoexcitation, the system explores a large volume of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> space on a time scale comparable to that of a single phonon oscillation. These results overturn the current understanding of an archetypal ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion and provide new microscopic insights into rapid evolution toward equilibrium in photoexcited matter.</p>

Heterogeneous to homogeneous melting transition visualized with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>The ultrafast laser excitation of matters leads to nonequilibrium states with complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion dynamics. We used electron diffraction at mega–electron volt energies to visualize the ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of gold on the atomic scale length. For energy densities approaching the irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing regime, we first observed heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing on time scales of 100 to 1000 picoseconds, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ioning to homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing that occurs catastrophically within 10 to 20 picoseconds at higher energy densities.

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in pure water under pressure if ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization could be suppressed.</p>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>e into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of the valence electrons into an exciton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate.

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion. This discovery will provide insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions of correlated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p>Chloroplasts develop from undifferentiated proplastids present in meristematic tissue. Thus, chloroplast biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of chloroplast biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during chloroplast development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from proplastids to functional chloroplasts. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of photosynthesis is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> is dependent on the activation of the chloroplast and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion to photosynthetically functional chloroplasts. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> also is associated with a spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion of the chloroplasts from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of photosynthesis is a two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and plastid genomes.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing tolerance. Similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing, salt and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s” are metastable collective states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> diagrams. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s can host exotic properties in otherwise conventional materials and hence may enable novel functionality and applications, but their discovery and access are still in early stages.

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma.

Five-dimensional imaging of freezing emulsions with solute effects

Interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>if</span></strong>ication fronts with objects leads to different outcomes, from total rejection of the objects to their complete engulfment. We imaged the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing of emulsions in five dimensions (space, time, and solute concentration) with confocal microscopy. We showed that the solute induces long-range interactions that determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>if</span></strong>ication microstructure. The local increase of solute concentration enhances pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing, which controls the engulfment of droplets by the front and the evolution of grain boundaries. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing emulsions may be a good analog of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>if</span></strong>ication systems where objects interact with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>if</span></strong>ication interface.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion. After crossing the critical point, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation provides a rational template to implement plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>e-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

Oncogenic RAS isoforms show a hierarchical requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS2 to mediate cell transformation
<p>About a third of tumors have activating mutations in <i>HRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, or <i>KRAS</i>, genes encoding guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS family. In these tumors, wild-type RAS cooperates with mutant RAS to promote downstream effector activation and cell proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, suggesting that upstream activators of wild-type RAS are important modulators of mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 mediates KRAS-driven proliferation, but little is understood about the role of SOS2. We found that RAS family members have a hierarchical requirement for the expression and activity of SOS2 to drive cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. <i>Sos2</i> deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent activation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation required the GEF activity of SOS2 and was restored in <i>Sos2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> MEFs by expression of constitutively activated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>SOS2</i> reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed phenotype of human <i>KRAS</i> mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains.

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> and then diffused into the liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> template.

The nanofiber arrays permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including adhesion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

An intrinsic S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint enforced by ATR

Here we show that cells transactivate the mitotic gene network as they exit the S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> through a CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1)–directed FOXM1 phosphorylation switch. During normal DNA replication, the checkpoint kinase ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is activated by ETAA1 to block this switch until the S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> ends. ATR inhibition prematurely activates FOXM1, deregulating the S/G<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion and leading to early mitosis, underreplicated DNA, and DNA damage. Thus, ATR couples DNA replication with mitosis and preserves genome integrity by enforcing an S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint.</p>

We report here that RNA critically regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation and the formation of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> difference called the Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>.

Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.</p>

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator

The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents.

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111).

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> nucleation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>).

The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state.

Quantum and isotope effects in lithium metal
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure of elements at zero pressure and temperature is the most fundamental information in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ed matter physics. For decades it has been believed that lithium, the simplest metallic element, has a complicated ground-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure. Using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells and multiscale simulations with density functional theory and molecular dynamics, we show that the previously accepted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">martensit</span></strong>ic ground state is metastable. The actual ground state is face-centered cubic (fcc). We find that isotopes of lithium, under similar thermal paths, exhibit a considerable difference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">martensit</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion temperature. Lithium exhibits nuclear quantum mechanical effects, serving as a metallic intermediate between helium, with its quantum effect–dominated structures, and the higher-mass elements. By disentangling the quantum kinetic complexities, we prove that fcc lithium is the ground state, and we synthesize it by decompression.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong spin-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s, this multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion by inhibiting expression of seed-specific genes during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including vegetative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and vegetative-to-reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in seedlings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell elongation, cell division, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of development to an adult vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of development before they enter the reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> change in Arabidopsis.</p>

Metastable ferroelectricity in optically strained SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>Fluctuating orders in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong>s are generally considered high-temperature precursors of broken symmetry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. However, in some cases, these fluctuations persist to zero temperature and prevent the emergence of long-range order. Strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) is a quantum paraelectric in which dipolar fluctuations grow upon cooling, although a long-range ferroelectric order never sets in. Here, we show that optical excitation of lattice vibrations can induce polar order. This metastable polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, observed up to temperatures exceeding 290 kelvin, persists for hours after the optical pump is interrupted. Furthermore, hardening of a low-frequency vibration points to a photoinduced ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion, with a spatial domain distribution suggestive of a photoflexoelectric coupling.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-separated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses.

The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA.

A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles
<p>Neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) form tight clusters at synapses. These clusters act as a reservoir from which SVs are drawn for exocytosis during sustained activity.

Here we found that synapsin can form a distinct liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate but were not necessary for its formation.

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-separated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-separated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals

The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport].

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid

Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease ductility. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">martensit</span></strong>e matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high ductility, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">martensit</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong></span></strong>ation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">martensit</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong></span></strong>ation and provides a pathway for the development of high-strength, high-ductility materials.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s of matter.</p>

Deterministic entanglement generation from driving through quantum phase transitions
<p>Many-body entanglement is often created through the system evolution, aided by nonlinear interactions between the constituting particles. These very dynamics, however, can also lead to fluctuations and degradation of the entanglement if the interactions cannot be controlled. Here, we demonstrate near-deterministic generation of an entangled twin-Fock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate of ~11,000 atoms by driving a<sub> </sub>arubidium-87 Bose-Einstein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate undergoing spin mixing through two consecutive quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions (QPTs). We directly observe number squeezing of 10.7 ± 0.6 decibels and normalized collective spin length of 0.99 ± 0.01. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> sensitivity of ~6 decibels beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of ~910 atoms. Our work highlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking advantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction
<sec><title>Hot Enough to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> Iron</title><p>Earth's core is divided into a fluid outer core and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solid</span></strong> inner core, both composed predominately of iron at extremely high pressures and temperatures.

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the lipids phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants balance the levels of these lipids to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the conversion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide production compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA production in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the conversion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing tolerance, acting by balancing TAG and PA production in Arabidopsis.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth rates during log <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth rate and the onset of the stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth rates in batch cultures during log <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, culminating with the onset of stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>.</p>

Developmental Changes in Scots Pine Transcriptome during Heartwood Formation
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) wood is desired in woodworking industries due to its favorable timber characteristics and natural durability that is contributed by heartwood extractives. It has been discussed whether the Scots pine heartwood extractives (mainly stilbenes and resin acids) are synthesized in the cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone between sapwood and heartwood, or if they are transported from the sapwood. Timing of heartwood formation during the yearly cycle has also not been unambiguously defined. We measured steady-state mRNA levels in Scots pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone and sapwood using RNA sequencing. Year-round expression profiles of selected transcripts were further investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. Differentially accumulating transcripts suggest that, of the Scots pine heartwood extractives, stilbenes are synthesized in situ in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone and gain their carbon-skeletons from Suc and triglycerides. Resin acids, on the other hand, are synthesized early in the spring mainly in the sapwood, meaning that they must be transported to the heartwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone. Heartwood formation is marked by programmed cell death that occurs during the summer months in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Light-Harvesting Antennae and State Transition in <i>chlorina</i> and cpSRP Mutants
<p>State <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions in photosynthesis provide for the dynamic allocation of a mobile fraction of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to photosystem II (PSII) in state I and to photosystem I (PSI) in state II. In the state I-to-state II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion, LHCII is phosphorylated by STN7 and associates with PSI to favor absorption cross-section of PSI. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with defects in chlorophyll (Chl) b biosynthesis or in the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) machinery to study the flexible formation of PS-LHC supercomplexes. Intriguingly, we found that impaired Chl b biosynthesis in <i>chlorina1-2</i> (<i>ch1-2</i>) led to preferentially stabilized LHCI rather than LHCII, while the contents of both LHCI and LHCII were equally depressed in the cpSRP43-deficient mutant (<i>chaos</i>). In view of recent findings on the modified state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions in LHCI-deficient mutants (Benson et al., 2015), the <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants were used to assess the influence of varying LHCI/LHCII antenna size on state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. Under state II conditions, LHCII-PSI supercomplexes were not formed in both <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> plants. LHCII phosphorylation was drastically reduced in <i>ch1-2</i>, and the inactivation of STN7 correlates with the lack of state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. In contrast, phosphorylated LHCII in <i>chaos</i> was observed to be exclusively associated with PSII complexes, indicating a lack of mobile LHCII in <i>chaos</i>. Thus, the comparative analysis of <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants provides new evidence for the flexible organization of LHCs and enhances our understanding of the reversible allocation of LHCII to the two photosystems.</p>

Furthermore, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase loss of function abolishes the induction of key inflammatory programs such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation of macrophages to a reparative phenotype, which results in enhanced repair and improved hemodynamic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal, for the first time, that the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase functions during cardiac ischemia as a pattern recognition receptor in the sterile immune response.

Whispering neurons fuel cortical highways
<p>The mammalian neocortex is one of the most intricate entities found in nature, both in terms of structure and function. It is the brain region responsible for the execution of high-order functions, including sensory perception, motor control, cognition, and speech. Its development is equally complex because it requires that millions to billions (depending on the species) of neurons assemble in distinct layers and connect with exquisite precision to perform complicated information processing operations. During embryonic development, formation of the cerebral cortex involves the migration of excitatory neurons generated in the ventricular zone toward the cortical plate, where they establish their final position in six well-defined horizontal layers consisting of different types of neurons and architecture. Along this migratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, developing neurons undergo a morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from multipolar shape to bipolar morphology. Bipolar neurons exhibit faster locomotion, quickly reaching their final destination. On page 313 of this issue, Ohtaka-Maruyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that this important switch to bipolar neurons is influenced by glutamate release from neurons located at the subplate, just beneath the cortical plate. Subplate neurons trigger this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation by making transient synaptic contacts with multipolar neurons in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong> to the cortical laminae. Understanding this process is important because disruption of neocortical migration results in several human neuro-developmental diseases.</p>

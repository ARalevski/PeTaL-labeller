Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e. D15 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

A selective insecticidal protein from <i>Pseudomonas</i> for controlling corn rootworms
<p>The coleopteran <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> western corn rootworm (WCR) (<i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> LeConte) is a devastating crop pest in North America and Europe. Although crop plants that produce <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (<i>Bt</i>) proteins can limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> infestation, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> populations have evolved resistance to <i>Bt</i> proteins. Here we describe an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>icidal protein, designated IPD072Aa, that is isolated from <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis.</i> Transgenic corn plants expressing IPD072Aa show protection from WCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> injury under field conditions. IPD072Aa leaves several lepidopteran and hemipteran <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> species unaffected but is effective in killing WCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e that are resistant to <i>Bt</i> proteins produced by currently available transgenic corn. IPD072Aa can be used to protect corn crops against WCRs.</p>

Increase in crop losses to insect pests in a warming climate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains—rice, maize, and wheat—but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider crop losses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of rice, maize, and wheat to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25% per degree of global mean surface warming. Crop losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong>s (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong> family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong>, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong>s.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e in the absence of detectable exchange with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e. Older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce contractions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced contractions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to contractions elicited in control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced contractions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic contractions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces contractions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body fluid, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

The projected effect on insects, vertebrates, and plants of limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C
<p>In the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United Nations is pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C, whereas earlier aspirations focused on a 2°C limit. With current pledges, corresponding to ~3.2°C warming, climatically determined geographic range losses of >50% are projected in ~49% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s, 44% of plants, and 26% of vertebrates. At 2°C, this falls to 18% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s, 16% of plants, and 8% of vertebrates and at 1.5°C, to 6% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s, 8% of plants, and 4% of vertebrates. When warming is limited to 1.5°C as compared with 2°C, numbers of species projected to lose >50% of their range are reduced by ~66% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s and by ~50% in plants and vertebrates.</p>

Human-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exoskeleton</span></strong>s and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded.

Optimized torque patterns from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exoskeleton</span></strong> worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exoskeleton</span></strong>s worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy.

Mass seasonal bioflows of high-flying insect migrants
<p>Migrating animals have an impact on ecosystems directly via influxes of predators, prey, and competitors and indirectly by vectoring nutrients, energy, and pathogens. Although linkages between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the effects of mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> “bioflows” have not been described. We quantified biomass flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying (>150 meters) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s and show that ~3.5 trillion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s (3200 tons of biomass) migrate above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s larger than 10 milligrams, which exploit seasonally beneficial tailwinds. Large seasonal differences in the southward versus northward transfer of biomass occur in some years, although flows were balanced over the 10-year period. Our long-term study reveals a major transport process with implications for ecosystem services, processes, and biogeochemistry.</p>

An Aphid Effector Targets Trafficking Protein VPS52 in a Host-Specific Manner to Promote Virulence
<p>Plant- and animal-feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s secrete saliva inside their hosts, containing effectors, which may promote nutrient release and suppress immunity. Although for plant pathogenic microbes it is well established that effectors target host proteins to modulate host cell processes and promote disease, the host cell targets of herbivorous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s remain elusive. Here, we show that the existing plant pathogenic microbe effector paradigm can be extended to herbivorous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s in that effector-target interactions inside host cells modify critical host processes to promote plant susceptibility. We showed that the effector Mp1 from <i>Myzus persicae</i> associates with the host Vacuolar Protein Sorting Associated Protein52 (VPS52). Using natural variants, we provide a strong link between effector virulence activity and association with VPS52, and show that the association is highly specific to <i>M</i>. <i>persicae</i>-host interactions. Also, coexpression of Mp1, but not Mp1-like variants, specifically with host VPS52s resulted in effector relocalization to vesicle-like structures that associate with prevacuolar compartments. We show that high VPS52 levels negatively impact virulence, and that aphids are able to reduce VPS52 levels during infestation, indicating that VPS52 is an important virulence target. Our work is an important step forward in understanding, at the molecular level, how a major agricultural pest promotes susceptibility during infestation of crop plants. We give evidence that an herbivorous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> employs effectors that interact with host proteins as part of an effective virulence strategy, and that these effectors likely function in a species-specific manner.</p>

Prolonged milk provisioning in a jumping spider
<p>Lactation is a mammalian attribute, and the few known nonmammal examples have distinctly different modalities. We document here milk provisioning in a jumping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong>, which compares functionally and behaviorally to lactation in mammals. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong>lings ingest nutritious milk droplets secreted from the mother’s epigastric furrow until the subadult stage. Milk is indispensable for offspring survival in the early stages and complements their foraging in later stages. Maternal care, as for some long-lived vertebrates, continues after the offspring reach maturity. Furthermore, a female-biased adult sex ratio is acquired only when the mother is present. These findings demonstrate that mammal-like milk provisioning and parental care for sexually mature offspring have also evolved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates, encouraging a reevaluation of their occurrence across the animal kingdom, especially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">invertebr</span></strong>ates.</p>

Topological and modality-specific representation of somatosensory information in the fly brain

Some sensory neurons innervate the ventral brain directly to form modality-specific and topological somatosensory maps. Ascending interneurons with dendrites in matching layers of the nerve cord send axons that converge to respective brain regions. Pathways arising from leg somatosensory neurons encode distinct qualities of leg movement information and play different roles in ground detection. Establishment of the ground pattern and genetic tools for neuronal manipulation should provide the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying somatosensation.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

An Arabidopsis TIR-Lectin Two-Domain Protein Confers Defense Properties against <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>
<p>Plant immunity depends on fast and specific transcriptional reprogramming triggered by the perception of biotic stresses. Numerous studies have been conducted to better understand the response of plants to the generalist herbivore two-spotted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong> mite (<i>Tetranychus urticae</i>). However, how plants perceive mites and how this perception is translated into changes in gene expression are largely unknown. In this work, we identified a gene induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong> mite attack that encodes a two-domain protein containing predicted lectin and Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domains. The gene, previously named <i>PP2-A5</i>, belongs to the Phloem Protein2 family. Biotic assays showed that PP2-A5 confers tolerance to <i>T. urticae</i>. Overexpression or knockout of <i>PP2-A5</i> leads to transcriptional reprogramming that alters the balance of hormone accumulation and corresponding signaling pathways. The nucleocytoplasmic location of this protein supports a direct interaction with regulators of gene transcription, suggesting that the combination of two putative signaling domains in a single protein may provide a novel mechanism for regulating gene expression. Together, our results suggest that PP2-A5 improves the ability to defend against <i>T. urticae</i> by participating in the tight regulation of hormonal cross talk upon mite feeding. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism by which this two-domain protein functions and to clarify its molecular role in signaling following a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong> mite attack.</p>

Loliolide, a Carotenoid Metabolite, Is a Potential Endogenous Inducer of Herbivore Resistance
<p>Jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in the induction of herbivore resistance in many plants. However, JA-independent herbivore resistance has been suggested. An herbivore-resistance-inducing substance was isolated from <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-infected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) leaves in which a hypersensitive response (HR) was induced and identified as loliolide, which has been identified as a β-carotene metabolite. When applied to tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves, loliolide decreased the survival rate of the two-spotted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong> mite, <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>, egg deposition by the same pest, and the survival rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e of the common cutworm <i>Spodoptera litura</i> without exhibiting toxicity against these herbivores. Endogenous loliolide levels increased not only with an infestation by <i>S</i>. <i>litura</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e, but also with the exogenous application of their oral secretions in tomato. A microarray analysis identified cell-wall–associated defense genes as loliolide-responsive tomato genes, and exogenous JA application did not induce the expression of these genes. <i>Suppressor of zeaxanthin</i>-<i>less</i> (<i>szl</i>), an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutant with a point mutation in a key gene of the β-carotene metabolic pathway, exhibited the decreased accumulation of endogenous loliolide and increased susceptibility to infestation by the western flower thrip (<i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i>). A pretreatment with loliolide decreased susceptibility to thrips in the JA-insensitive Arabidopsis mutant <i>coronatine</i>-<i>insensitive1</i>. Exogenous loliolide did not restore reduced electrolyte leakage in <i>szl</i> in response to a HR-inducing bacterial strain. These results suggest that loliolide functions as an endogenous signal that mediates defense responses to herbivores, possibly independently of JA, at least in tomato and Arabidopsis plants.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant viruses are spread from plant to plant by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s.</p>

<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> performance.</p>

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p>Female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s of diverse orders bore into substrates to deposit their eggs. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the forces required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard substrates.</p>

Can bees see at a glance?
<p>Primates can analyse visual scenes extremely rapidly, making accurate decisions for presentation times of only 20 ms. We asked whether bumblebees, despite having potentially more limited processing power, could similarly detect and discriminate visual patterns presented for durations of 100 ms or less. Bumblebees detected stimuli and discriminated between differently oriented and coloured stimuli when presented as briefly as 25 ms but failed to identify ecologically relevant shapes (predatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong>s on flowers) even when presented for 100 ms. This suggests an important difference between primate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> visual processing, so that while primates can capture entire visual scenes ‘at a glance’, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s might have to rely on continuous online sampling of the world around them, using a process of active vision, which requires longer integration times.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Hyperactive locomotion in a <i>Drosophila</i> model is a functional readout for the synaptic abnormalities underlying fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual disability and autism and affects ~1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. The discovery of effective treatments for FXS has been hampered by the lack of effective animal models and phenotypic readouts for drug screening. FXS ensues from the epigenetic silencing or loss-of-function mutation of the <i>fragile X mental retardation 1</i> (<i>FMR1</i>) gene, which encodes an RNA binding protein that associates with and represses the translation of target mRNAs. We previously found that the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) downstream of augmented synthesis of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 2 receptor (BMPR2) promotes aberrant synaptic development in mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> models of FXS and that these molecular and cellular markers were correlated in patients with FXS. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l locomotion is augmented in a <i>Drosophila</i> FXS model. Genetic or pharmacological intervention on the BMPR2-LIMK pathway ameliorated the synaptic abnormality and locomotion phenotypes of FXS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e, as well as hyperactivity in an FXS mouse model. Our study demonstrates that (i) the BMPR2-LIMK pathway is a promising therapeutic target for FXS and (ii) the locomotion phenotype of FXS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e is a quantitative functional readout for the neuromorphological phenotype associated with FXS and is amenable to the screening novel FXS therapeutics.</p>

Transgenic <i>Metarhizium</i> rapidly kills mosquitoes in a malaria-endemic region of Burkina Faso
<p>Malaria control efforts require implementation of new technologies that manage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>icide resistance. <i>Metarhizium pingshaense</i> provides an effective, mosquito-specific delivery system for potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>-selective toxins. A semifield trial in a MosquitoSphere (a contained, near-natural environment) in Soumousso, a region of Burkina Faso where malaria is endemic, confirmed that the expression of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>-specific toxin (Hybrid) increased fungal lethality and the likelihood that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>icide-resistant mosquitoes would be eliminated from a site. Also, as Hybrid-expressing <i>M. pingshaense</i> is effective at very low spore doses, its efficacy lasted longer than that of the unmodified <i>Metarhizium</i>. Deployment of transgenic <i>Metarhizium</i> against mosquitoes could (subject to appropriate registration) be rapid, with products that could synergistically integrate with existing chemical control strategies to avert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>icide resistance.</p>

Plant iron acquisition strategy exploited by an insect herbivore
<p>Insect herbivores depend on their host plants to acquire macro- and micronutrients. Here we asked how a specialist herbivore and damaging maize pest, the western corn rootworm, finds and accesses plant-derived micronutrients. We show that the root-feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e use complexes between iron and benzoxazinoid secondary metabolites to identify maize as a host, to forage within the maize root system, and to increase their growth. Maize plants use these same benzoxazinoids for protection against generalist herbivores and, as shown here, for iron uptake. We identify an iron transporter that allows the corn rootworm to benefit from complexes between iron and benzoxazinoids. Thus, foraging for an essential plant-derived complex between a micronutrient and a secondary metabolite shapes the interaction between maize and a specialist herbivore.</p>

Unnaturally aglow with a bright inner light
<p>Bioluminescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s, fungi, and sea creatures must have seemed mysterious and supernatural to the people of antiquity. It was not until the late 19th century that science began to displace the magic by demonstrating that bioluminescence in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s, such as the firefly (<i>Photinus pyralis</i>), is a chemical reaction that requires a protein (a luciferase) and substrates [adenosine triphosphate (ATP), O<sub>2</sub>, and a luciferin, <sc>d</sc>-luciferin] (<i>1</i>). Understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of bioluminescence has grown over the past century, as has appreciation of its widespread prevalence in nature. Since cloning the gene for firefly luciferase (<i>2</i>), researchers have sought to exploit this molecular lightbulb for bioanalysis applications and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) in model animals (<i>3</i>). On page 935 of this issue, Iwano <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) report the development of a luciferase-luciferin pair that, due to its brightness and red-colored glow, opens the door to a range of biomedical applications, such as detection of single cells deep within tissue, that were not previously feasible with BLI.</p>

Identification of Functional Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Affecting Leaf Hair Number in <i>Brassica rapa</i>
<p>Leaf traits affect plant agronomic performance; for example, leaf hair number provides a morphological indicator of drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> resistance. <i>Brassica rapa</i> crops have diverse phenotypes, and many <i>B. rapa</i> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified and used as molecular markers for plant breeding. However, which SNPs are functional for leaf hair traits and, therefore, effective for breeding purposes remains unknown. Here, we identify a set of SNPs in the <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinenesis</i> candidate gene <i>BrpHAIRY LEAVES1</i> (<i>BrpHL1</i>) and a number of SNPs of <i>BrpHL1</i> in a natural population of 210 <i>B. rapa</i> accessions that have hairy, margin-only hairy, and hairless leaves. <i>BrpHL1</i> genes and their orthologs and paralogs have many SNPs. By intensive mutagenesis and genetic transformation, we selected the functional SNPs for leaf hairs by the exclusion of nonfunctional SNPs and the orthologous and paralogous genes. The residue tryptophan-92 of BrpHL1a was essential for direct interaction with GLABROUS3 and, thus, necessary for the formation of leaf hairs. The accessions with the functional SNP leading to substitution of the tryptophan-92 residue had hairless leaves. The orthologous <i>BrcHL1b</i> from <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i> regulates hair formation on leaf margins rather than leaf surfaces. The selected SNP for the hairy phenotype could be adopted as a molecular marker for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> resistance in <i>Brassica</i> spp. crops. Moreover, the procedures optimized here can be used to explain the molecular mechanisms of natural variation and to facilitate the molecular breeding of many crops.</p>

A Mucin-Like Protein of Planthopper Is Required for Feeding and Induces Immunity Response in Plants
<p>The brown planthopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>, is a pest that threatens rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. While feeding on rice plants, planthoppers secrete saliva, which plays crucial roles in nutrient ingestion and modulating plant defense responses, although the specific functions of salivary proteins remain largely unknown. We identified an <i>N. lugens</i>-secreted mucin-like protein (NlMLP) by transcriptome and proteome analyses and characterized its function, both in brown planthopper and in plants. <i>NlMLP</i> is highly expressed in salivary glands and is secreted into rice during feeding. Inhibition of <i>NlMLP</i> expression in planthoppers disturbs the formation of salivary sheaths, thereby reducing their performance. In plants, NlMLP induces cell death, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition. These defense responses are related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the MEK2 MAP kinase and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. The active region of NlMLP that elicits plant responses is located in its carboxyl terminus. Our work provides a detailed characterization of a salivary protein from a piercing-sucking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> other than aphids. Our finding that the protein functions in plant immune responses offers new insights into the mechanism underlying interactions between plants and herbivorous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were detected weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage.

The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Learning can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the learnt odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of learnability across odour intensities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>e were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">larva</span></strong>l <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate intensity learning, and discuss how they may be implemented in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong> brain.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p>Females of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females.</p>

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome
<p>The red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, follows an XX (female) and XY (male) sex determination system. Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insect</span></strong>s to follow the female pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates male sex determination in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic females (XX) that are fertile. The virgin females mated with these masculinized genetic females produced all female progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for male sex determination is present on the Y chromosome. These data also suggest that the Y chromosome in <i>T. castaneum</i> is not required for male fertility.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spider</span></strong> <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

VASCULAR PLANT ONE-ZINC FINGER1 (VOZ1) and VOZ2 Interact with CONSTANS and Promote Photoperiodic Flowering Transition
<p>In plants, endogenous and environmental signals such as light control the timing of the transition to flowering. Two phytochrome B-interacting transcription factors, VASCULAR PLANT ONE-ZINC FINGER1 (VOZ1) and VOZ2, redundantly promote flowering in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In the <i>voz1 voz2</i> mutant, the expression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) was up-regulated and that of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>) was down-regulated, which was proposed to be the cause of late flowering in <i>voz1 voz2</i>. However, the detailed mechanism by which the <i>VOZ</i> genes promote flowering is not well understood. Here, we show that neither the reduced <i>FT</i> expression nor the late-flowering phenotype of <i>voz1 voz2</i> is suppressed in the <i>voz1 voz2 flc</i> triple mutant. Genetic interaction experiments between <i>voz1 voz2</i> and <i>constans-2</i> (<i>co-2</i>) mutants reveal that the <i>VOZs</i> and <i>CO</i> work in the same genetic pathway. Using in vitro pull-down, electrophoretic mobility shift, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we show that VOZ1 and VOZ2 interact with CO. The <i>voz1 voz2 35S</i>::<i>CO</i>:<i>YFP</i> plants show suppression of the early-flowering phenotype induced by <i>CO</i> overexpression, suggesting that CO requires VOZ for the induction of flowering. Determination of the VOZ consensus-binding site followed by genome-wide sequence analysis failed to identify any VOZ-binding sites near known flowering time genes. Together, these results indicate that the <i>VOZ</i> genes regulate flowering primarily through the photoperiod pathway, independent of <i>FLC</i>, and suggest that VOZs modulate CO function to promote flowering.</p>

Transcription Factor WRKY75 Interacts with DELLA Proteins to Affect Flowering
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time is tightly controlled by both endogenous and exogenous signals. Although several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of WRKY transcription factors in floral initiation, the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways involved remain elusive. Here, we newly identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) WRKY DNA binding protein75 (WRKY75) as a positive regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing initiation. Mutation of <i>WRKY75</i> resulted in a delay in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing, whereas overexpression of <i>WRKY75</i> significantly accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing in Arabidopsis. Gene expression analysis showed that the transcript abundance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time integrator gene <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>) was lower in <i>wrky75</i> mutants than in the wild type, but greater in <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that WRKY75 directly binds to the promoter of <i>FT</i>. Both in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrated that WRKY75 interacts with DELLA proteins. We found that both REPRESSOR OF <i>ga1-3</i> (RGA) RGA-LIKE1 (RGL1) and GA INSENSITIVE (GAI) can repress the activation ability of WRKY75, thereby attenuating expression of its regulon. Genetic analyses indicated that <i>WRKY75</i> positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing in a FT-dependent manner and overexpression of <i>RGL1</i> or gain-of-function of <i>GAI</i> could partially rescue the early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing phenotype of <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that WRKY75 may function as a new component of the GA-mediated signaling pathway to positively regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing in Arabidopsis.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering time were identified. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> VOZ (Vascular plant One-Zinc finger) transcription factors are required for proper regulation of flowering time
<p>Transition to flowering in plants is tightly controlled by environmental cues, which regulate the photoperiod and vernalization pathways, and endogenous signals, which mediate the autonomous and gibberellin pathways. In this work, we investigated the role of two Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger transcription factors, the paralogues AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2, in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> flowering. Single <i>atvoz1-1</i> and <i>atvoz2-1</i> mutants showed no significant phenotypes as compared to wild type. However, <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> double mutant plants exhibited several phenotypes characteristic of flowering-time mutants. The double mutant displayed a severe delay in flowering, together with additional pleiotropic phenotypes. Late flowering correlated with elevated expression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>), which encodes a potent floral repressor, and decreased expression of its target, the floral promoter <i>FD</i>. Vernalization rescued delayed flowering of <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> and reversed elevated <i>FLC</i> levels. Accumulation of <i>FLC</i> transcripts in <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> correlated with increased expression of several <i>FLC</i> activators, including components of the PAF1 and SWR1 chromatin-modifying complexes. Additionally, AtVOZs were shown to bind the promoter of <i>MOS3/SAR3</i> and directly regulate expression of this nuclear pore protein, which is known to participate in the regulation of flowering time, suggesting that AtVOZs exert at least some of their flowering regulation by influencing the nuclear pore function. Complementation of <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> with AtVOZ2 reversed all double mutant phenotypes, confirming that the observed morphological and molecular changes arise from the absence of functional AtVOZ proteins, and validating the functional redundancy between AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2.</p>

ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 Coordinates CONSTANS to Delay Flowering by Recruiting the Transcriptional Corepressor TPR2
<p>ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 (AFP2) negatively regulates the abscisic acid signal by accelerating ABI5 degradation during seed germination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The abscisic acid signal is reported to delay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing by up-regulating <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing Locus C</i> expression, but the role of AFP2 in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time is unknown. Here, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time was markedly delayed and <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) expression was reduced in a transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing <i>AFP2</i> under LD conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function <i>afp2</i> mutant showed slightly earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing, with higher <i>CO</i> expression. These data suggest that <i>AFP2</i> negatively regulates photoperiod-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time by modulating the CO signal. We then found that <i>AFP2</i> exhibited circadian expression rhythms that peaked during the night. Furthermore, the C-terminus of AFP2 interacted with CO, while its N-terminal ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motif interacted with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS-related protein2 (TPR2). Thus, AFP2 bridges CO and TPR2 to form the CO-AFP2-TPR2 complex. Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that AFP2 mediated CO degradation during the night. AFP2 also recruited histone deacetylase activity at <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing Locus T</i> chromatin through its interaction with TPR2. Taken together, our results reveal an elaborate mechanism by which AFP2 modulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time through coordinating the activity and stability of CO.</p>

Night-Break Experiments Shed Light on the Photoperiod1-Mediated Flowering
<p>Plants utilize variation in day length (photoperiod) to anticipate seasonal changes. They respond by modulating their growth and development to maximize seed production, which in cereal crops is directly related to yield. In wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the acceleration of flowering under long days (LD) is dependent on the light induction of <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>PPD1</i>) by phytochromes. Under LD, <i>PPD1</i> activates <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> (<i>FT1</i>), a mobile signaling protein that travels from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem to promote flowering. Here, we show that the interruption of long nights by short pulses of light (“night-break” [NB]) accelerates wheat flowering, suggesting that the duration of the night is critical for wheat photoperiodic response. <i>PPD1</i> transcription was rapidly upregulated by NBs, and the magnitude of this induction increased with the length of darkness preceding the NB. Cycloheximide abolished the NB up-regulation of <i>PPD1</i>, suggesting that this process is dependent on active protein synthesis during darkness. While one NB was sufficient to induce <i>PPD1</i>, more than 15 NBs were required to induce high levels of <i>FT1</i> expression and a strong acceleration of flowering. Multiple NBs did not affect the expression of core circadian clock genes. The acceleration of flowering by NB disappeared in <i>ppd1-</i>null mutants, demonstrating that this response is mediated by <i>PPD1</i>. The acceleration of flowering was strongest when NBs were applied in the middle of the night, suggesting that in addition to <i>PPD1</i>, other circadian-controlled factors are required for the up-regulation of <i>FT1</i> expression and the acceleration of flowering.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Temporal-Specific Interaction of NF-YC and CURLY LEAF during the Floral Transition Regulates Flowering
<p>The flowering time of higher plants is controlled by environmental cues and intrinsic signals. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), flowering is accelerated by exposure to long-day conditions via the key photoperiod-induced factor FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Nuclear Factor-Y subunit C (NF-YC) proteins function as important mediators of epigenetic marks in different plant developmental stages and play an important role in the regulation of <i>FT</i> transcription, but the mechanistic details of this remain unknown. In this study, we show that Arabidopsis NF-YC homologs temporally interact with the histone methyltransferase CURLY LEAF (CLF) during the flowering transition. The binding of NF-YC antagonizes the association of CLF with chromatin and the CLF-dependent deposition of H3 lysine-27 trimethylation, thus relieving the repression of <i>FT</i> transcription and facilitating flowering under long-day conditions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of NF-YC/CLF-mediated epigenetic regulation of <i>FT</i> activation in photoperiod-induced flowering and, consequently, contribute to our understanding of how plants control developmental events in a temporal-specific regulatory manner.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain vegetative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and vegetative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain vegetative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many preproteins that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast preproteins contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> through the chloroplast envelope membranes for proteins containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of soluble proteins through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast proteins affect protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of TMD-containing proteins.</p>

The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-based VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-based VIF did not cause transgenerational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing. We showed that the PVX-based VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-based VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-based VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing temperatures during spring. The warm winters of recent years interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral induction in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network controlling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting temperature conditions, low and high. The start of reproductive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and induction of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes potentially involved in floral induction, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight potential flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient temperatures, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of potential flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

DNA Topoisomerase Iα Affects the Floral Transition
<p>DNA topoisomerases modulate DNA topology to maintain chromosome superstructure and genome integrity, which is indispensable for DNA replication and RNA transcription. Their function in plant development still remains largely unknown. Here, we report a hitherto unidentified role of Topoisomerase Iα (TOP1α) in controlling flowering time in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Loss of function of <i>TOP1α</i> results in early flowering under both long and short days. This is attributed mainly to a decrease in the expression of a central flowering repressor, <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>), and its close homologs, <i>MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4</i> (<i>MAF4</i>) and <i>MAF5</i>, during the floral transition. TOP1α physically binds to the genomic regions of <i>FLC</i>, <i>MAF4</i>, and <i>MAF5</i> and promotes the association of RNA polymerase II complexes to their transcriptional start sites. These correlate with the changes in histone modifications but do not directly affect nucleosome occupancy at these loci. Our results suggest that TOP1α mediates DNA topology to facilitate the recruitment of RNA polymerase II at <i>FLC</i>, <i>MAF4</i>, and <i>MAF5</i> in conjunction with histone modifications, thus facilitating the expression of these key flowering repressors to prevent precocious flowering in Arabidopsis.</p>

The nuclear translocation of the kinases p38 and JNK promotes inflammation-induced cancer
<p>The stimulated nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of signaling proteins, such as MAPKs, is a necessity for the initiation and regulation of their physiological functions. Previously, we determined that nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated peptide targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY peptide specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong>, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY peptide reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY peptide substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. The PERY peptide more effectively prevented colon cancer development than did a commercial p38 inhibitor. In vivo analysis further suggested that this effect was mediated by PERY peptide–induced prevention of the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of p38 in macrophages. Together, these results support the use of the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of p38 and JNK as a novel drug target to treat various cancers and inflammation-induced diseases.</p>

A regulatory circuit conferring varied flowering response to cold in annual and perennial plants
<p>The reproductive strategies of plants are highly variable. Short-lived annuals flower abundantly soon after germination, whereas longer-lived perennials postpone and spatially restrict flowering. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and interspecies gene transfer to understand divergence in reproductive patterns between annual and perennial crucifers. We show that in perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i>, flowering in response to winter cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of reproduction in annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct flowering pathways acting in parallel.</p>

Gibberellin Acts Positively Then Negatively to Control Onset of Flower Formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<sec><title>One Hormone, Two Phases</title><p>The switch from vegetative growth to flowering in the plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> involves two phases—inflorescence branching and flowering. <bold>Yamaguchi <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 638) examined how the phytohormone gibberellin regulates each phase differently. First, gibberellin levels increase and stimulate production of key flowering factors, one of which degrades gibberellin. As gibberellin levels then fall, the next phase of flowering factors is released from gibberellin repression. By regulating inflorescence branching separately from flowering, this system determines overall seed yield.</p></sec>

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

Tetrahydrofolate Modulates Floral Transition through Epigenetic Silencing
<p>Folates, termed from tetrahydrofolate (THF) and its derivatives, function as coenzymes in one-carbon transfer reactions and play a central role in synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids. Dysfunction of cellular folate metabolism leads to serious defects in plant development; however, the molecular mechanisms of folate-mediated cellular modifications and physiological responses in plants are still largely unclear. Here, we reported that THF controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time by adjusting DNA methylation-regulated gene expression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type seedlings supplied with THF as well as the high endogenous THF content mutant <i>dihydrofolate synthetase folypoly-Glu synthetase homolog B</i> exhibited significant up-regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing repressor of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing Wageningen</i> and thereby delaying floral transition in a dose-dependent manner. Genome-wide transcripts and DNA methylation profiling revealed that THF reduces DNA methylation so as to manipulate gene expression activity. Moreover, in accompaniment with elevated cellular ratios between monoglutamylated and polyglutamylated folates under increased THF levels, the content of <i>S</i>-adenosylhomo-Cys, a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases, was obviously higher, indicating that enhanced THF accumulation may disturb cellular homeostasis of the concerted reactions between folate polyglutamylation and folate-dependent DNA methylation. In addition, we found that the loss-of-function mutant of CG DNA methyltransferase MET1 displayed much less responsiveness to THF-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time alteration. Taken together, our studies revealed a novel regulatory role of THF on epigenetic silencing, which will shed lights on the understanding of interrelations in folate homeostasis, epigenetic variation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing control in plants.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target in patients with various cancers. Unfortunately, resistance to EGFR-targeted therapeutics is common. Previous studies identified two mechanisms of resistance to the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of EGFR bypasses the inhibitory effects of cetuximab, and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates cetuximab resistance by maintaining EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that AXL mediated the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of EGFR in the setting of cetuximab resistance. Cetuximab-resistant clones of non–small cell lung cancer in culture and patient-derived xenografts in mice had increased abundance of AXL and nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Cellular fractionation analysis, super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that genetic loss of AXL reduced the accumulation of nEGFR. SRC family kinases (SFKs) and HER family ligands promote the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of EGFR. We found that AXL knockdown reduced the expression of the genes encoding the SFK family members YES and LYN and the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). AXL knockdown also decreased the interaction between EGFR and the related receptor HER3 and accumulation of HER3 in the nucleus. Overexpression of LYN and NRG1 in cells depleted of AXL resulted in accumulation of nEGFR, rescuing the deficit induced by lack of AXL. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unrecognized role for AXL in regulating the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of EGFR and suggest that AXL-mediated SFK and <i>NRG1</i> expression promote this process.</p>

Fusion oncogenes—genetic musical chairs
<p>The cytogenetic definitions of many cancers predate the genome sequencing era. Indeed, some classes of cancers (largely subtypes of sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias) have long been defined by simple and distinct patterns of chromosomal changes, or karyotypes, that, in many cases, feature a single pathognomonic somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> of two genomic regions that creates a fusion oncogene (for example, the Philadelphia chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> in chronic myelogenous leukemia results in the <i>BCR-ABL1</i> fusion oncogene) (<i>1</i>). Whereas many common cancers display genomic complexity consistent with multistep oncogenesis, such as carcinomas of breast and lung, cancers that are defined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong>s typically display simple karyotypes, suggesting that they were shaped by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong>. However, the cytogenetic simplicity of these cancers may mask more complex genomic events. On page 891 of this issue, Anderson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), an aggressive sarcoma that is defined by fusion between the EWS RNA binding protein 1 (<i>EWSR1</i>) gene on chromosome 22 and an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factor gene, either <i>FLI1</i> at 11q24 or <i>ERG</i> at 21q11 (<i>3</i>). Anderson <i>et al.</i> show that ∼40% of <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> fusions and all <i>EWSR1-ERG</i> fusions arise via a complex rearrangement pattern called chromoplexy, which was first identified in prostate cancer (<i>4</i>). They suggest that chromoplexy “bursts” may be early initiating events in Ewing sarcomagenesis and mark a more aggressive form of the disease.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time
<p>Plants integrate seasonal signals, including temperature and day length, to optimize the timing of developmental transitions. Seasonal sensing requires the activity of two proteins, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), that control certain developmental transitions in plants. During reproductive development, the mother plant uses FLC and FT to modulate progeny seed dormancy in response to temperature. We found that for regulation of seed dormancy, <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> function in opposite configuration to how those same genes control time to flowering. For seed dormancy, FT regulates seed dormancy through <i>FLC</i> gene expression and regulates chromatin state by activating antisense <i>FLC</i> transcription. Thus, in <i>Arabidopsis</i> the same genes controlled in opposite format regulate flowering time and seed dormancy in response to the temperature changes that characterize seasons.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

The Role of Auxin in the Pattern Formation of the Asteraceae Flower Head (Capitulum)
<p>Nature often creates complex structures by rearranging pre-existing units. One such example is the flower head (capitulum) in daisies, where a group of flowers (florets) and phyllaries (modified bracts) are arranged to superficially mimic a single flower. The capitulum is a key taxonomical innovation that defines the daisy family (Asteraceae), the largest flowering plant group. However, patterning mechanisms underlying its structure remain elusive. Here, we show that auxin, a plant hormone, provides a developmental patterning cue for the capitulum. During capitulum development, a temporal auxin gradient occurs, regulating the successive and centripetal formation of distinct florets and phyllaries. Disruption of the endogenous auxin gradient led to homeotic conversions of florets and phyllaries in the capitulum. Furthermore, auxin regulates floral meristem identity genes, such as <i>Matricaria inodora RAY2</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>inodora LEAFY</i>, which determine floret and phyllary identity. This study reveals the mechanism of capitulum patterning and highlights how common developmental tools, such as hormone gradients, have independently evolved in plants and animals.</p>

Enhancer-Promoter Interaction of <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> Shapes Photoperiod Adaptation
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a major vegetable fruit grown and consumed worldwide. Modern cultivated tomatoes are derived from their wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, a short-day plant that originated from the Andean region of South America. The molecular underpinnings of the regional adaptation and expansion of domesticated tomato remain largely unclear. In this study, we examined flowering time in wild and cultivated tomatoes under both long-day and short-day conditions. Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we identified <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> (<i>SP5G</i>) as a major locus influencing daylength adaptation in tomato. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the genomic region harboring <i>SP5G</i> shows signatures of a domestication sweep. We found that a 52-bp sequence within the 3′ untranslated region of <i>SP5G</i> is essential for the enhanced expression of this gene, leading to delayed flowering time in tomatoes through a promoter-enhancer interaction that occurs only under long-day conditions. We further demonstrate that the absence of the 52-bp sequence attenuates the promoter-enhancer interaction and reduces <i>SP5G</i> expression in cultivated tomatoes, making their flowering time insensitive to daylength. Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation at the enhancer region of the <i>SP5G</i> 3′ untranslated region confers reduced photoperiodic response in cultivated tomatoes, uncovering a regulatory mechanism that could potentially be used to manipulate flowering time in tomato through novel biotechnological approaches.</p>

The COMPASS-Like Complex Promotes Flowering and Panicle Branching in Rice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing time (heading date) and panicle branch number are important agronomic traits that determine yield in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing requires histone methylation, but the roles of trimethylation of Lys 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) in modulating heading date and panicle development are unclear. Here, we showed that the COMPASS-like complex promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing and panicle branching. The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) WD40 protein OsWDR5a interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1/SET domain group protein 723 (SDG723) to form the core components of the COMPASS-like complex. Plants in which <i>OsWDR5a</i> or <i>OsTrx1</i> expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of <i>OsWDR5a</i> function resulted in embryo lethality. OsWDR5a binds to <i>Early heading date 1</i> to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels. Together, our results show that the COMPASS-like complex promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Flower</span></strong>ing and panicle development and suggest that modulation of H3K4me3 levels by the COMPASS-like complex is critical for rice development.</p>

The Transcription Factor COL12 Is a Substrate of the COP1/SPA E3 Ligase and Regulates Flowering Time and Plant Architecture<sup>1</sup>
<p>The ambient light environment controls many aspects of plant development throughout a plant’s life cycle. Such complex control is achieved because a key repressor of light signaling, the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COP1/SPA E3 ubiquitin ligase causes the degradation of multiple regulators of endogenous developmental pathways. This includes the CONSTANS (CO) transcription factor that is responsible for photoperiodic control of flowering time. There are 16 CO-like proteins whose functions are only partly understood. Here, we show that 14 CO-like (COL) proteins bind CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A-105 (SPA)1 in vitro. We subsequently focused on COL12 and show that COL12 binds COP1 and SPA proteins in vivo. The COL12 protein is degraded in darkness in a COP1-dependent fashion, indicating that COL12 is a substrate of the COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of COL12 causes late flowering specifically in long day conditions by decreasing the expression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i>. This phenotype is genetically dependent on <i>CO.</i> Consistent with this finding, COL12 physically interacts with CO in vivo, suggesting that COL12 represses flowering by inhibiting CO protein function. We show that COL12 overexpression did not alter CO protein stability. It is therefore likely that COL12 represses the activity of CO rather than CO levels. Overexpression of COL12 also affects plant architecture by increasing the number of rosette branches and reducing inflorescence height. These phenotypes are <i>CO</i> independent. Hence, we suggest that COL12 affects plant development through CO-dependent and CO-independent mechanisms.</p>

A Flowering Locus C Homolog Is a Vernalization-Regulated Repressor in <i>Brachypodium</i> and Is Cold Regulated in Wheat
<p>Winter cereals require prolonged cold to transition from vegetative to reproductive development. This process, referred to as vernalization, has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In Arabidopsis, a key flowering repressor called <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) quantitatively controls the vernalization requirement. By contrast, in cereals, the vernalization response is mainly regulated by the <i>VERNALIZATION</i> genes, <i>VRN1</i> and <i>VRN2</i>. Here, we characterize <i>ODDSOC2</i>, a recently identified <i>FLC</i> ortholog in monocots, knowing that it belongs to the <i>FLC</i> lineage. By studying its expression in a diverse set of <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions, we find that it is a good predictor of the vernalization requirement. Analyses of transgenics demonstrated that <i>BdODDSOC2</i> functions as a vernalization-regulated flowering repressor. In most <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions <i>BdODDSOC2</i> is down-regulated by cold, and in one of the winter accessions in which this down-regulation was evident, <i>BdODDSOC2</i> responded to cold before <i>BdVRN1.</i> When stably down-regulated, the mechanism is associated with spreading H3K27me3 modifications at the <i>BdODDSOC2</i> chromatin. Finally, homoeolog-specific gene expression analyses identify <i>TaAGL33</i> and its splice variant <i>TaAGL22</i> as the <i>FLC</i> orthologs in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) behaving most similar to <i>Brachypodium ODDSOC2</i>. Overall, our study suggests that <i>ODDSOC2</i> is not only phylogenetically related to <i>FLC</i> in eudicots but also functions as a flowering repressor in the vernalization pathway of <i>Brachypodium</i> and likely other temperate grasses. These insights could prove useful in breeding efforts to refine the vernalization requirement of temperate cereals and adapt varieties to changing climates.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous hormone ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a pathogenesis-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the hormonal regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. Silencing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene silencing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and silencing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Structure of the posttranslational Sec protein-translocation channel complex from yeast

We determined a structure of the Sec complex (Sec61-Sec63-Sec71-Sec72) from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> by cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure shows that Sec63 tightly associates with Sec61 through interactions in cytosolic, transmembrane, and ER-luminal domains, prying open Sec61’s lateral gate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> pore and thus activating the channel for substrate engagement.

Is ungulate migration culturally transmitted? Evidence of social learning from translocated animals
<p>Ungulate migrations are assumed to stem from learning and cultural transmission of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance.</p>

Translocation of a gut pathobiont drives autoimmunity in mice and humans

Hepatocyte–<i>E. gallinarum</i> cocultures induced autoimmune-promoting factors. Pathobiont <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> in monocolonized and autoimmune-prone mice induced autoantibodies and caused mortality, which could be prevented by an intramuscular vaccine targeting the pathobiont. <i>E. gallinarum</i>–specific DNA was recovered from liver biopsies of autoimmune patients, and cocultures with human hepatocytes replicated the murine findings; hence, similar processes apparently occur in susceptible humans. These discoveries show that a gut pathobiont can translocate and promote autoimmunity in genetically predisposed hosts.</p>

Ratchet-like polypeptide translocation mechanism of the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104
<p>Hsp100 polypeptide translocases are conserved members of the AAA+ family (adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities) that maintain proteostasis by unfolding aberrant and toxic proteins for refolding or proteolytic degradation. The Hsp104 disaggregase from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> solubilizes stress-induced amorphous aggregates and amyloids. The structural basis for substrate recognition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> is unknown. Using a model substrate (casein), we report cryo–electron microscopy structures at near-atomic resolution of Hsp104 in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> states. Substrate interactions are mediated by conserved, pore-loop tyrosines that contact an 80-angstrom-long unfolded polypeptide along the axial channel. Two protomers undergo a ratchet-like conformational change that advances pore loop–substrate interactions by two amino acids. These changes are coupled to activation of specific nucleotide hydrolysis sites and, when transmitted around the hexamer, reveal a processive rotary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> mechanism and substrate-responsive flexibility during Hsp104-catalyzed disaggregation.</p>

Down-regulation of the Sucrose Transporter <i>CsSUT1</i> Causes Male Sterility by Altering Carbohydrate Supply
<p>In plants, male sterility is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop male sterility, but it remains unclear whether Suc transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-affinity Suc-H<sup>+</sup> symporter. <i>CsSUT1</i> is expressed in male flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen, and companion cells of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments, and pedicel. The male flowers of <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNA interference (RNAi) lines exhibited a decrease in Suc, hexose, and starch content, relative to those of the wild type, during the later stages of male flower development, a finding that was highly associated with male sterility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport, and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most <i>myeloblastosis</i> (<i>MYB</i>) transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNAi lines relative to wild type. Our findings demonstrate that male sterility can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <i>CsSUT1</i> expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific <i>MYB</i> transcription factors. This knowledge provides a new approach for bioengineering male sterility in crop plants.</p>

A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-Distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation
<p>Root nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant’s nitrogen demand for growth. Here, we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) roots to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. <i>OsMADS57</i> is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, <i>osmads57</i> mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had 2-fold higher levels. Shoot-root <sup>15</sup>N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression lines. Rapid NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> root influx experiments showed that mutation of <i>OsMADS57</i> did not affect root nitrate uptake. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis of <i>OsNRT2</i> nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> (a vascular-specific high-affinity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional <i>NRT2</i> genes (<i>OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4</i>). Conversely, in the overexpression lines, four <i>NRT2</i> genes had much higher expression profiles at all time points tested. As previously reported, <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> functions in nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong>, indicating the possible interaction between <i>OsMADS57</i> and <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif (CATTTTATAG) within the <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> promoter. Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in <i>osmads57</i> mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to root tips of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> from root to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) transporters to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong>, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong>, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Pivotal Roles of Cryptochromes 1a and 2 in Tomato Development and Physiology
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-containing blue/UVA light photoreceptors that regulate various plant light-induced physiological processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cryptochromes mediate de-etiolation, photoperiodic control of flowering, entrainment of the circadian clock, cotyledon opening and expansion, anthocyanin accumulation, and root growth. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), cryptochromes are encoded by a multigene family, comprising <i>CRY1a</i>, <i>CRY1b</i>, <i>CRY2</i>, and <i>CRY3</i>. We have previously reported the phenotypes of tomato <i>cry1a</i> mutants and <i>CRY2</i> overexpressing plants. Here, we report the isolation by targeting induced local lesions in genomes, of a tomato <i>cry2</i> knock-out mutant, its introgression in the indeterminate Moneymaker background, and the phenotypes of <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> single and double mutants. The <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> mutant showed phenotypes similar to its Arabidopsis counterpart (long hypocotyls in white and blue light), but also several additional features such as increased seed weight and internode length, enhanced hypocotyl length in red light, inhibited primary root growth under different light conditions, anticipation of flowering under long-day conditions, and alteration of the phase of circadian leaf movements. Both cry1a and cry2 control the levels of photosynthetic pigments in leaves, but cry2 has a predominant role in fruit pigmentation. Metabolites of the sterol, tocopherol, quinone, and sugar classes are differentially accumulated in <i>cry1a</i> and <i>cry2</i> leaves and fruits. These results demonstrate a pivotal role of cryptochromes in controlling tomato development and physiology. The manipulation of these photoreceptors represents a powerful tool to influence important agronomic traits such as flowering time and fruit quality.</p>

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited genomic resources. We used comparative chromosome painting to identify the extent of chromosomal collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid genomes (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress genomes originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) genome, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> chromosomes (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong> in watercress, both genomes are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental subgenomes might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress genomes. The subgenome stasis, apart from the single-chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translocation</span></strong>, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid genomes. The octoploid genome of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress genomes, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cytogenomic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-genome sequencing efforts and genetic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>PIRL6</i> Is Essential for Male and Female Gametogenesis and Is Regulated by Alternative Splicing
<p>Plant intracellular Ras-group leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins (PIRLs) are related to Ras-interacting animal LRR proteins that participate in developmental cell signaling. Systematic knockout analysis has implicated some members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>PIRL</i> family in pollen development. However, for <i>PIRL6</i>, no bona fide knockout alleles have been recovered, suggesting that it may have an essential function in both male and female gametophytes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated <i>PIRL6</i> expression and induced knockdown by RNA interference. Knockdown triggered defects in gametogenesis, resulting in abnormal pollen and early developmental arrest in the embryo sac. Consistent with this, <i>PIRL6</i> was expressed in gametophytes: functional transcripts were detected in wild-type flowers but not in <i>sporocyteless</i> (<i>spl</i>) mutant flowers, which do not produce gametophytes. A genomic PIRL6-GFP fusion construct confirmed expression in both pollen and the embryo sac. Interestingly, <i>PIRL6</i> is part of a convergent overlapping gene pair, a scenario associated with an increased likelihood of alternative splicing. We detected multiple alternative <i>PIRL6</i> mRNAs in vegetative organs and <i>spl</i> mutant flowers, tissues that lacked the functionally spliced transcript. cDNA sequencing revealed that all contained intron sequences and premature termination codons. These alternative mRNAs accumulated in the nonsense-mediated decay mutant <i>upf3</i>, indicating that they are normally subjected to degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that <i>PIRL6</i> is required in both male and female gametogenesis and suggest that sporophytic expression is negatively regulated by unproductive alternative splicing. This posttranscriptional mechanism may function to minimize PIRL6 protein expression in sporophyte tissues while allowing the overlapping adjacent gene to remain widely transcribed.</p>

Mobility of Antiflorigen and PEBP mRNAs in Tomato-Tobacco Heterografts
<p>Photoperiodic floral induction is controlled by the leaf-derived and antagonistic mobile signals florigen and antiflorigen. In response to photoperiodic variations, florigen and antiflorigen are produced in leaves and translocated through phloem to the apex, where they counteract floral initiation. Florigen and antiflorigen are encoded by a pair of homologs belonging to <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>)- or <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>)-like clades in the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding domain protein (PEBP) family. The PEBP gene family contains <i>FT</i>-, <i>TFL1</i>-, and <i>MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1</i> (<i>MFT</i>)-like clades. Evolutionary analysis suggests that <i>FT</i>- and <i>TFL1</i>-like clades arose from an ancient <i>MFT</i>-like clade. The protein movement of the PEBP family is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in many plants; however, the mRNA movement of the PEBP family remains controversial. Here, we examined the mRNA movement of PEBP genes in different plant species. We identified a tobacco (<i>Nicotiana sylvestris</i>) <i>CENTRORADIALIS-like1</i> gene, denoted <i>NsCET1</i>, and showed that <i>NsCET1</i> is an ortholog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) antiflorigen <i>ATC</i>. In tobacco, <i>NsCET1</i> acts as a mobile molecule that non-cell-autonomously inhibits flowering. Grafting experiments showed that endogenous and ectopically expressed <i>NsCET1</i> mRNAs move long distances in tobacco and Arabidopsis. Heterografts of tobacco and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) showed that, in addition to <i>NsCET1</i>, multiple members of the <i>FT</i>-, <i>TFL1</i>-, and <i>MFT</i>-like clades of tobacco and tomato PEBP gene families are mobile mRNAs. Our results suggest that the mRNA mobility is a common feature of the three clades of PEBP-like genes among different plant species.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the biological functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Characterization of Multiple C2 Domain and Transmembrane Region Proteins in Arabidopsis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic organisms and may function as signaling molecules that mediate trafficking of other regulators. Although there are a large number of MCTPs found in the plant lineage, biological information on most plant MCTPs remains unknown. Here, we report systematic characterization of 16 members in the entire Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MCTP family. Using GUS and GFP reporter assays, we reveal their distinct or overlapping patterns of gene expression and protein localization in developing Arabidopsis plants and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf epidermal cells. We further analyze in vivo effects of three C2 domains on the regulatory role of MCTP1 (FTIP1) in flowering time control in Arabidopsis, demonstrating that these C2 domains may be cooperative to mediate FTIP1 function during the floral transition. Through examining all available T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis <i>MCTPs</i>, we further reveal that <i>mctp6-1</i> significantly enhances the late-flowering phenotype of <i>ftip1-1</i> possibly through affecting FLOWERING LOCUS T in different manners, exemplifying that different MCTPs additively regulate a specific plant developmental process. Taken together, our results suggest functional divergence or redundancy of MCTP members in Arabidopsis and provide a community resource for further understanding various MCTP functions in plant development.</p>

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), control the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the control of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL control the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to control the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

<i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> Redundancy Fine-Tunes Photoperiod Sensitivity
<p>Three pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) loci controlling photoperiod sensitivity, <i>HIGH RESPONSE</i> (<i>HR</i>), <i>DIE NEUTRALIS</i> (<i>DNE</i>), and <i>STERILE NODES</i> (<i>SN</i>), have recently been shown to correspond to orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian clock genes <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>), <i>ELF4</i>, and <i>LUX ARRHYTHMO</i>, respectively. A fourth pea locus, <i>PHOTOPERIOD</i> (<i>PPD</i>), also contributes to the photoperiod response in a similar manner to <i>SN</i> and <i>DNE</i>, and recessive <i>ppd</i> mutants on a spring-flowering <i>hr</i> mutant background show early, photoperiod-insensitive flowering. However, the molecular identity of <i>PPD</i> has so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the <i>PPD</i> locus also has a role in maintenance of diurnal and circadian gene expression rhythms and identify <i>PPD</i> as an <i>ELF3</i> co-ortholog, termed <i>ELF3b</i>. Genetic interactions between pea <i>ELF3</i> genes suggest that loss of <i>PPD</i> function does not affect flowering time in the presence of functional <i>HR</i>, whereas <i>PPD</i> can compensate only partially for the lack of <i>HR</i>. These results provide an illustration of how gene duplication and divergence can generate potential for the emergence of more subtle variations in phenotype that may be adaptively significant.</p>

Atypical Protein Phosphatase 2A Gene Families Do Not Expand via Paleopolyploidization
<p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) presents unique opportunities for analyzing molecular mechanisms of functional divergence between gene family members. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. Genes encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multigene families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Genes encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit gene families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-genome duplications followed by nonrandom gene loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit gene family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of gene dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-genome duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A gene families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

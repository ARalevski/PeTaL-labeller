<i>MtNODULE ROOT1</i> and <i>MtNODULE ROOT2</i> Are Essential for Indeterminate Nodule Identity
<p>Symbiotic interactions between legume plants and rhizobia result in the formation of nitrogen-fixing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, but the molecular actors and the mechanisms allowing for the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity are poorly understood. <i>Medicago truncatula <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>E ROOT1</i> (<i>MtNOOT1</i>), <i>Pisum sativum COCHLEATA1</i> (<i>PsCOCH1</i>), and <i>Lotus japonicus NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE1</i> (<i>LjNBCL1</i>) are orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtBLADE-ON-PETIOLE1/2</i> and are members of the <i>NBCL</i> gene family, which has conserved roles in plant development and is essential for indeterminate and determinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity in legumes. The loss of function of <i>MtNOOT1</i>, <i>PsCOCH1</i>, and <i>LjNBCL1</i> triggers a partial loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity characterized by the development of ectopic roots arising from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e vascular meristems. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a second gene involved in regulating indeterminate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity in <i>M. truncatula</i>, <i>MtNOOT2</i>. <i>MtNOOT2</i> is the paralog of <i>MtNOOT1</i> and belongs to a second legume-specific <i>NBCL</i> subclade, the <i>NBCL2</i> clade. <i>MtNOOT2</i> expression was induced during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e formation, and it was expressed primarily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e central meristem. <i>Mtnoot2</i> mutants did not present any particular symbiotic phenotype; however, the loss of function of both <i>MtNOOT1</i> and <i>MtNOOT2</i> resulted in the complete loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity and was accompanied by drastic changes in the expression of symbiotic, defense, and root apical meristem marker genes. <i>Mtnoot1 noot2</i> double mutants developed only nonfixing root-like structures that were no longer able to host symbiotic rhizobia. This study provides original insights into the molecular basis underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e identity in legumes forming indeterminate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es.</p>

<i>INCREASING NODULE SIZE1</i> Expression Is Required for Normal Rhizobial Symbiosis and Nodule Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation is crucial for biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in legumes, but the molecular mechanisms underlying BNF have remained elusive. Here, we cloned a candidate gene underlying a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation quantitative trait locus in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), <i>INCREASING <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>E SIZE1</i> (<i>GmINS1</i>). <i>GmINS1</i> encodes a cell wall β-expansin and is expressed primarily in vascular bundles, along with cortical and parenchyma cells of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinguishing the two parents were found in the <i>GmINS1</i> promoter region. Among them, single-nucleotide polymorphism A/C has a significant effect on <i>GmINS1</i> expression in the parental genotype P2, based on β-glucuronidase activity and promoter deletion analysis. The expression of <i>GmINS1</i> and the P2 genotype promoter was strongly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development, not only in the parents but also in 40 progeny lines and 40 genotypes selected from a soybean core collection. Overexpression of <i>GmINS1</i> resulted in increases in the number, biomass, infection cell abundance, and nitrogenase activity of large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es and subsequently changed the nitrogen content and biomass of soybean plants. <i>GmINS1</i> suppression via RNA interference had the opposite effect. Double suppression of <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> dramatically inhibited soybean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation. Our results reveal that <i>GmINS1</i> is a critical gene in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and that <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> synergistically control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation in soybean. Our findings shed light on the genetic basis of soybean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation and provide a candidate gene for optimizing BNF capacity through molecular breeding in soybean.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone auxin into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral roots. To test the role of auxin influx in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation we used the auxin influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of auxin influx transporters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e primordia, the vasculature of developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and at the apex of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several auxin response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root gravitropism, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and auxin resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS auxin reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots developed fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early auxin responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of auxin during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

The MicroRNA390/TAS3 Pathway Mediates Symbiotic Nodulation and Lateral Root Growth
<p>Legume roots form two types of postembryonic organs, lateral roots and symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e formation is the result of the interaction of legumes with rhizobia and requires the mitotic activation and differentiation of root cells as well as an independent, but coordinated, program that allows infection by rhizobia. MicroRNA390 (miR390) is an evolutionarily conserved microRNA that targets the <i>Trans-Acting Short Interference RNA3</i> (<i>TAS3</i>) transcript. Cleavage of <i>TAS3</i> by ARGONAUTE7 results in the production of trans-acting small interference RNAs, which target mRNAs encoding AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2 (ARF2), ARF3, and ARF4. Here, we show that activation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> regulatory module by overexpression of miR390 in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> promotes lateral root growth but prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e organogenesis, rhizobial infection, and the induction of two key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation genes, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation Signaling Pathway1</i> (<i>NSP1</i>) and <i>NSP2</i>. Accordingly, inactivation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> module, either by expression of a miR390 target mimicry construct or mutations in <i>ARGONAUTE7</i>, enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation and rhizobial infection, alters the spatial distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and increases the percentage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es with multiple meristems. Our results revealed a key role of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> pathway in legumes as a modulator of lateral root organs, playing opposite roles in lateral root and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development.</p>

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and transport within and between plant tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e-specific citrate transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 transported citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate transport into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e numbers.</p>

Bacterial Biosensors for in Vivo Spatiotemporal Mapping of Root Secretion
<p>Plants engineer the rhizosphere to their advantage by secreting various nutrients and secondary metabolites. Coupling transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) rhizosphere, a suite of bioreporters has been developed in <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv <i>viciae</i> strain 3841, and these detect metabolites secreted by roots in space and time. Fourteen bacterial <i>lux</i> fusion bioreporters, specific for sugars, polyols, amino acids, organic acids, or flavonoids, have been validated in vitro and in vivo. Using different bacterial mutants (<i>nodC</i> and <i>nifH</i>), the process of colonization and symbiosis has been analyzed, revealing compounds important in the different steps of the rhizobium-legume association. Dicarboxylates and sucrose are the main carbon sources within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es; in ineffective (<i>nifH</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, particularly low levels of sucrose were observed, suggesting that plant sanctions affect carbon supply to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. In contrast, high <i>myo</i>-inositol levels were observed prior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e formation and also in <i>nifH</i> senescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Amino acid biosensors showed different patterns: a γ-aminobutyrate biosensor was active only inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, whereas the phenylalanine bioreporter showed a high signal also in the rhizosphere. The bioreporters were further validated in vetch (<i>Vicia hirsuta</i>), producing similar results. In addition, vetch exhibited a local increase of <i>nod</i> gene-inducing flavonoids at sites where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es developed subsequently. These bioreporters will be particularly helpful in understanding the dynamics of root exudation and the role of different molecules secreted into the rhizosphere.</p>

<i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> HtpG Interaction with nsLTP AsE246 Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation
<p>Plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are involved in a number of biological processes including root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e symbiosis. However, the role of nsLTPs in legume-rhizobium symbiosis remains poorly understood, and no rhizobia proteins that interact with nsLTPs have been reported to date. In this study, we used a bacteria two-hybrid system and identified the high temperature protein G (HtpG) from <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> that interacts with the nsLTP AsE246. The interaction between HtpG and AsE246 was confirmed by far-Western blotting and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Our results indicated that the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) domain of HtpG mediates the HtpG-AsE246 interaction. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HtpG was colocalized with AsE246 in infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e cells and symbiosome membranes. Expression of the <i>htpG</i> gene was relatively higher in young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es and was highly expressed in the infection zones. Further investigation showed that <i>htpG</i> expression affects lipid abundance and profiles in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es and plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and nitrogen fixation. Our findings provide further insights into the functional mechanisms behind the transport of symbiosome lipids via nsLTPs in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es.</p>

NIN Acts as a Network Hub Controlling a Growth Module Required for Rhizobial Infection
<p>The symbiotic infection of root cells by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation requires the transcription factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e Inception (NIN). Our root hair transcriptomic study extends NIN’s regulon to include <i>Rhizobium Polar Growth</i> and genes involved in cell wall modification, gibberellin biosynthesis, and a comprehensive group of nutrient (N, P, and S) uptake and assimilation genes, suggesting that NIN’s recruitment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation was based on its role as a growth module, a role shared with other NIN-Like Proteins. The expression of jasmonic acid genes in <i>nin</i> suggests the involvement of NIN in the resolution of growth versus defense outcomes. We find that the regulation of the growth module component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation Pectate Lyase by NIN, and its function in rhizobial infection, are conserved in hologalegina legumes, highlighting its recruitment as a major event in the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation Pectate Lyase is secreted to the infection chamber and the lumen of the infection thread. Gene network analysis using the transcription factor mutants for <i>ERF Required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation1</i> and <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> confirms hierarchical control of NIN over <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> and shows that ERF Required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation1 acts independently to control infection. We conclude that while NIN shares functions with other NIN-Like Proteins, the conscription of key infection genes to NIN’s control has made it a central regulatory hub for rhizobial infection.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e senescence.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation via MtNIN, plays an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation homeostasis.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detection system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene production increased as early as 6 hours after inoculation with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod factor production by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation mutants showed that perception of Nod factor was required for ethylene emission, while downstream transcription factors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. Activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation signaling pathway in spontaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene production. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes act redundantly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this redundancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of nitrogen fixation, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced nitrogen fixation. These results demonstrate that ethylene production is an early and sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation response that acts at multiple stages to regulate infection, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e organogenesis, and nitrogen fixation in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

DELLA1-Mediated Gibberellin Signaling Regulates Cytokinin-Dependent Symbiotic Nodulation
<p>In legume plants, low-nitrogen soils promote symbiotic interactions with rhizobial bacteria, leading to the formation of nitrogen-fixing root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Among critical signals regulating this developmental process are bacterial Nod Factors (NFs) and several plant hormones, including cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs). Here, we show in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that GA signaling mediated by DELLA1 decreases the amount of bioactive CKs in roots and negatively impacts the Cytokinin Response1 (CRE1)-dependent NF activation of a subset of CK-signaling genes as well as of the CK-regulated <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation Signaling Pathway2</i> and <i>Ethylene Response Factor Required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation1</i> early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation genes. Consistently, a dominant-active DELLA1 protein can partially rescue the reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation of the <i>cre1</i> mutant and triggers the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e-like structures when expressed in the root cortex or in the root epidermis. This suggests a model where the DELLA1-mediated GA signaling interplays with the CRE1-dependent CK pathway to regulate early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation in response to both NF and CK signals critical for this symbiotic interaction.</p>

The phenotypic characterization carried out in independent <i>L. japonicus</i> LORE1 insertion lines indicates a positive role of LjNPF8.6 on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e functioning, as knockout mutants display N-fixation deficiency (25%) and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ar superoxide content.

In <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, the expression of two thiamine biosynthesis genes, <i>THI1</i> and <i>THIC</i>, was enhanced by inoculation with rhizobia but not by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. <i>THIC</i> and <i>THI2</i> (a <i>THI1</i> paralog) were expressed in uninoculated leaves. <i>THI2</i>-knockdown plants and the transposon insertion mutant <i>thiC</i> had chlorotic leaves. This typical phenotype of thiamine deficiency was rescued by an exogenous supply of thiamine. In wild-type plants, <i>THI1</i> was expressed mainly in roots and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and the <i>thi1</i> mutant had green leaves even in the absence of exogenous thiamine. <i>THI1</i> was highly expressed in actively dividing cells of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e primordia. The <i>thi1</i> mutant had small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es, and this phenotype was rescued by exogenous thiamine and by <i>THI1</i> complementation. Exogenous thiamine increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e diameter, but the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization was unaffected in the <i>thi1</i> mutant or by exogenous thiamine. Expression of symbiotic marker genes was induced normally, implying that mainly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e growth was delayed in the <i>thi1</i> mutant. Furthermore, this mutant formed many immature seeds with reduced seed weight. These results indicate that thiamine biosynthesis mediated by THI1 enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e enlargement and is required for seed development in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The genetic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin biosynthesis is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several biosynthesis families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin biosynthesis pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. These results show the importance of cytokinin biosynthesis in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the ability of legumes to associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation. We show that SLs promote infection thread formation, as a null SL-deficient pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infection threads than wild-type plants, and this reduction can be overcome by the application of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the plant before or after infection thread formation, since SL-deficient plants displayed a similar ability to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es appear to fix nitrogen at a similar rate to those of wild-type plants. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infection thread formation or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudation or the ability of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infection thread formation was accompanied by reduced expression of some early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation genes. Importantly, SL synthesis is down-regulated by mutations in genes of the Nod LCO signaling pathway, and this requires the downstream transcription factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the expression of certain SL biosynthesis genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL biosynthesis. SLs appear to influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation independently of ethylene action, as SL-deficient and ethylene-insensitive double mutant plants display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene synthesis or vice versa.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e structure.</p>

A Legume TOR Protein Kinase Regulates <i>Rhizobium</i> Symbiosis and Is Essential for Infection and Nodule Development
<p>The target of rapamycin (<i>TOR</i>) protein kinase regulates metabolism, growth, and life span in yeast, animals, and plants in coordination with nutrient status and environmental conditions. The nutrient-dependent nature of <i>TOR</i> functionality makes this kinase a putative regulator of symbiotic associations involving nutrient acquisition. However, <i>TOR</i>’s role in these processes remains to be understood. Here, we uncovered the role of <i>TOR</i> during the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>)-<i>Rhizobium tropici</i> (<i>Rhizobium</i>) symbiotic interaction. <i>TOR</i> was expressed in all tested bean tissues, with higher transcript levels in the root meristems and senesced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. We showed <i>TOR</i> promoter expression along the progressing infection thread and in the infected cells of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es. Posttranscriptional gene silencing of <i>TOR</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) showed that this gene is involved in lateral root elongation and root cell organization and also alters the density, size, and number of root hairs. The suppression of <i>TOR</i> transcripts also affected infection thread progression and associated cortical cell divisions, resulting in a drastic reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e numbers. <i>TOR</i>-RNAi resulted in reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and altered <i>CyclinD1</i> and <i>CyclinD3</i> expression, which are crucial factors for infection thread progression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e organogenesis. Enhanced expression of <i>TOR</i>-regulated <i>ATG</i> genes in <i>TOR</i>-RNAi roots suggested that <i>TOR</i> plays a role in the recognition of <i>Rhizobium</i> as a symbiont. Together, these data suggest that <i>TOR</i> plays a vital role in the establishment of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e symbiosis in the common bean.</p>

Phylogenomics reveals multiple losses of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis
<p>The root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria affects global nitrogen cycles and food production but is restricted to a subset of genera within a single clade of flowering plants. To explore the genetic basis for this scattered occurrence, we sequenced the genomes of 10 plant species covering the diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e morphotypes, bacterial symbionts, and infection strategies. In a genome-wide comparative analysis of a total of 37 plant species, we discovered signatures of multiple independent loss-of-function events in the indispensable symbiotic regulator <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>E INCEPTION</i> in 10 of 13 genomes of non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ating species within this clade. The discovery that multiple independent losses shaped the present-day distribution of nitrogen-fixing root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e symbiosis in plants reveals a phylogenetically wider distribution in evolutionary history and a so-far-underestimated selection pressure against this symbiosis.</p>

ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 Is Required for <i>M. truncatula</i> CLE12, But Not CLE13, Peptide Signaling through the SUNN Receptor Kinase
<p>The combinatorial interaction of a receptor kinase and a modified CLE peptide is involved in several developmental processes in plants, including autoregulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation (AON), which allows legumes to limit the number of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es formed based on available nitrogen and previous rhizobial colonization. Evidence supports the modification of CLE peptides by enzymes of the hydroxyproline <i>O</i>-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT/RDN) family. Here, we show by grafting and genetic analysis in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that, in the AON pathway, RDN1, functioning in the root, acts upstream of the receptor kinase SUNN, functioning in the shoot. As expected for a glycosyltransferase, we found that RDN1 and RDN2 proteins are localized to the Golgi, as was shown previously for AtHPAT1. Using composite plants with transgenic hairy roots, we show that <i>RDN1</i> and <i>RDN2</i> orthologs from dicots as well as a related <i>RDN</i> gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) can rescue the phenotype of <i>rdn1-2</i> when expressed constitutively, but the less related <i>MtRDN3</i> cannot. The timing of the induction of <i>MtCLE12</i> and <i>MtCLE13</i> peptide genes (negative regulators of AON) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ating roots is not altered by the mutation of <i>RDN1</i> or <i>SUNN</i>, although expression levels are higher. Plants with transgenic roots constitutively expressing <i>MtCLE12</i> require both RDN1 and SUNN to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e formation, while plants constitutively expressing <i>MtCLE13</i> require only SUNN, suggesting that the two CLEs have different requirements for function. Combined with previous work, these data support a model in which RDN1 arabinosylates MtCLE12, and this modification is necessary for the transport and/or reception of the AON signal by the SUNN kinase.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e expression. We found statistically significant effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>e production occur through processes not previously connected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Genome-Wide Identification of <i>Medicago</i> Peptides Involved in Macronutrient Responses and Nodulation
<p>Growing evidence indicates that small, secreted peptides (SSPs) play critical roles in legume growth and development, yet the annotation of SSP-coding genes is far from complete. Systematic reannotation of the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> genome identified 1,970 homologs of established SSP gene families and an additional 2,455 genes that are potentially novel SSPs, previously unreported in the literature. The expression patterns of known and putative SSP genes based on 144 RNA sequencing data sets covering various stages of macronutrient deficiencies and symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and mycorrhiza were investigated. Focusing on those known or suspected to act via receptor-mediated signaling, 240 nutrient-responsive and 365 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation-responsive Signaling-SSPs were identified, greatly expanding the number of SSP gene families potentially involved in acclimation to nutrient deficiencies and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation.

New dimensions for brain mapping
<p>The representation of memory in the brain is one of the unresolved questions in neuroscience. A key feature of learning and memory is the process of neuroplasticity—the ability of the brain to remodel structurally and functionally as a result of cognitive experience. Although the neurobiological basis of this process (that is, synaptic plasticity) is well established, the system level dynamics of neuroplasticity are still unclear. Recently, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), which can be carried out noninvasively in humans, provided a new approach to explore neuroplasticity. One of the parameters extracted from DW-MRI is mean diffusivity (MD) of water molecules, which is a biomarker of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>e (<i>1</i>). By probing changes in MD across the brain, areas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>al plasticity can be detected within hours of learning. On page 1045 of this issue, Brodt <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) used DW-MRI after an object-location memory task and found that brain plasticity occurs in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) rather than in the hippocampus. Furthermore, they demonstrated that localized DW-MRI changes follow the basic definition of a memory engram (the physical manifestation of memories stored in the brain). These observations go beyond the understanding of memory representation in the brain. Probing MD with DW-MRI appears to provide a detailed and comprehensive monitoring of brain microanatomy, revealing uncharted relations between brain structure and function.</p>

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media

The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque.

Here, we report an optical experiment demonstrating that the mean path length of light is invariant with respect to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>e of the medium it scatters through. Using colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path length is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in scattering strength.

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p>Chloroplasts are multifunctional organelles whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid membranes has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of chloroplast under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand RNA ((+)RNA) virus, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) to observe chloroplast structural changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the chloroplast membranes, characterized by the clustering of outer membrane-invaginated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spherul</span></strong>es in inner membrane-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of cytoplasmic invaginations (CIs) were evident with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spherul</span></strong>es at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the cytoplasm. Immunoelectron microscopy of these viral components verified that the aberrant membrane structures were sites for BSMV replication. The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the chloroplasts and played a prominent role in eliciting chloroplast membrane rearrangements. In sum, our results have revealed the 3D structure of the chloroplasts induced by BSMV infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of chloroplast morphological changes under stress conditions and during assembly of plant (+)RNA virus replication complexes.</p>

Architecture of the complete oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ two-component signal transduction system
<p>The symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i> is critical to the agro-industrial production of soybean because it enables the production of high yields of soybeans with little use of nitrogenous fertilizers. The FixL and FixJ two-component system (TCS) of this bacterium ensures that nitrogen fixation is only stimulated under conditions of low oxygen. When it is not bound to oxygen, the histidine kinase FixL undergoes autophosphorylation and transfers phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the response regulator FixJ, which, in turn, stimulates the expression of genes required for nitrogen fixation. We purified full-length <i>B. japonicum</i> FixL and FixJ proteins and defined their structures individually and in complex using small-angle x-ray scattering, crystallographic, and in silico modeling techniques. Comparison of active and inactive forms of FixL suggests that intramolecular signal transduction is driven by local changes in the sensor domain and in the coiled-coil region connecting the sensor and histidine kinase domains. We also found that FixJ exhibits conformational plasticity not only in the monomeric state but also in tetrameric complexes with FixL during phosphotransfer. This structural characterization of a complete TCS contributes both a mechanistic and evolutionary understanding to TCS signal relay, specifically in the context of the control of nitrogen fixation in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>es.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-strength aluminum alloys are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-strength aluminum alloys require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of solute clusters. This results in better material strength and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>es formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones.

The resulting 2D COFs are isolated as single-crystalline, micrometer-sized particles. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the dispersed COF nanoparticles revealed improvement in signal quality by two to three orders of magnitude relative to polycrystalline powder samples, and suggests exciton diffusion over longer length scales than those obtained through previous approaches.

The local increase of solute concentration enhances premelting, which controls the engulfment of droplets by the front and the evolution of grain boundaries. Freezing emulsions may be a good analog of many solidification systems where objects interact with a solidification interface.</p>

Three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials with a twist
<p>Rationally designed artificial materials enable mechanical properties that are inaccessible with ordinary materials. Pushing on an ordinary linearly elastic bar can cause it to be deformed in many ways. However, a twist, the counterpart of optical activity in the static case, is strictly zero. The unavailability of this degree of freedom hinders applications in terms of mode conversion and the realization of advanced mechanical designs using coordinate transformations. Here, we aim at realizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>ed three-dimensional elastic chiral mechanical metamaterials that overcome this limitation. On overall millimeter-sized samples, we measure twists per axial strain exceeding 2°/%. Scaling up the number of unit cells for fixed sample dimensions, the twist is robust due to metamaterial stiffening, indicating a characteristic length scale and bringing the aforementioned applications into reach.</p>

Controlled growth and form of precipitating microsculptures
<p>Controlled self-assembly of three-dimensional shapes holds great potential for fabrication of functional materials. Their practical realization requires a theoretical framework to quantify and guide the dynamic sculpting of the curved structures that often arise in accretive mineralization. Motivated by a variety of bioinspired coprecipitation patterns of carbonate and silica, we develop a geometrical theory for the kinetics of the growth front that leaves behind thin-walled complex structures. Our theory explains the range of previously observed experimental patterns and, in addition, predicts unexplored assembly pathways. This allows us to design a number of functional base shapes of optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>es, which we synthesize to demonstrate their light-guiding capabilities. Overall, our framework provides a way to understand and control the growth and form of functional precipitating microsculptures.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels
<p>Fatigue failures create enormous risks for all engineered structures, as well as for human lives, motivating large safety factors in design and, thus, inefficient use of resources. Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue resistance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>es are hierarchical and laminated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response. The exceptional properties enabled by this strategy provide guidance for all fatigue-resistant alloy design efforts.</p>

Microstructural proliferation in human cortex is coupled with the development of face processing
<p>How does cortical tissue change as brain function and behavior improve from childhood to adulthood? By combining quantitative and functional magnetic resonance imaging in children and adults, we find differential development of high-level visual areas that are involved in face and place recognition. Development of face-selective regions, but not place-selective regions, is dominated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>al proliferation. This tissue development is correlated with specific increases in functional selectivity to faces, as well as improvements in face recognition, and ultimately leads to differentiated tissue properties between face- and place-selective regions in adulthood, which we validate with postmortem cytoarchitectonic measurements. These data suggest a new model by which emergent brain function and behavior result from cortical tissue proliferation rather than from pruning exclusively.</p>

Medicago LINC Complexes Function in Nuclear Morphology, Nuclear Movement, and Root Nodule Symbiosis
<p>Nuclear movement is involved in cellular and developmental processes across eukaryotic life, often driven by Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes, which bridge the nuclear envelope (NE) via the interaction of Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 Homology (KASH) and Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) LINC complexes are involved in nuclear movement and positioning in several cell types. Observations since the 1950s have described targeted nuclear movement and positioning during symbiosis initiation between legumes and rhizobia, but it has not been established whether these movements are functional or incidental. Here, we identify and characterize LINC complexes in the model legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. We show that LINC complex characteristics such as NE localization, dependence of KASH proteins on SUN protein binding for NE enrichment, and direct SUN-KASH binding are conserved between plant species. Using a SUN dominant-negative strategy, we demonstrate that LINC complexes are necessary for proper nuclear shaping and movement in <i>Medicago</i> root hairs, and are important for infection thread initiation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nodul</span></strong>ation.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>es. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in addition to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein tool kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic tool kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In addition, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Microstructural Impact of Ischemia and Bone Marrow–Derived Cell Therapy Revealed With Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tractography of the Heart In Vivo
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The arrangement of myofibers in the heart is highly complex and must be replicated by injected cells to produce functional myocardium. A novel approach to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>al response of the myocardium to ischemia and cell therapy, with the use of serial diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography of the heart in vivo, is presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Validation of the approach was performed in normal (n=6) and infarcted mice (n=6) as well as healthy human volunteers. Mice (n=12) were then injected with bone marrow mononuclear cells 3 weeks after coronary ligation. In half of the mice the donor and recipient strains were identical, and in half the strains were different. A positive response to cell injection was defined by a decrease in mean diffusivity, an increase in fractional anisotropy, and the appearance of new myofiber tracts with the correct orientation. A positive response to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was seen in 1 mouse. The response of the majority of mice to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was neutral (9/12) or negative (2/12). The in vivo tractography findings were confirmed with histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography was able to directly resolve the ability of injected cells to generate new myofiber tracts and provided a fundamental readout of their regenerative capacity. A highly novel and translatable approach to assess the efficacy of cell therapy in the heart is thus presented.</p></sec>

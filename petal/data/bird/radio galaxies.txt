Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blazar</span></strong>, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blazar</span></strong> and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blazar</span></strong> during an active phase suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blazar</span></strong>s may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

Neutrino emission from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 prior to the IceCube-170922A alert
<p>A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blazar</span></strong> TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blazar</span></strong>. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blazar</span></strong>s are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.</p>

Measurement of the small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium using close quasar pairs
<p>The distribution of diffuse gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) imprints a series of hydrogen absorption lines on the spectra of distant background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quasar</span></strong>s known as the Lyman-α forest. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that IGM density fluctuations are suppressed below a characteristic scale where thermal pressure balances gravity. We measured this pressure-smoothing scale by quantifying absorption correlations in a sample of close <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quasar</span></strong> pairs. We compared our measurements to hydrodynamical simulations, where pressure smoothing is determined by the integrated thermal history of the IGM. Our findings are consistent with standard models for photoionization heating by the ultraviolet radiation backgrounds that reionized the universe.</p>

[C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm emission from the host galaxies of damped Lyman-alpha systems
<p>Gas surrounding high-redshift galaxies has been studied through observations of absorption line systems toward background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quasar</span></strong>s for decades. However, it has proven difficult to identify and characterize the galaxies associated with these absorbers due to the intrinsic faintness of the galaxies compared with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quasar</span></strong>s at optical wavelengths. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, we report on detections of [C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm line and dust-continuum emission from two galaxies associated with two such absorbers at a redshift of <i>z</i> ~ 4. Our results indicate that the hosts of these high-metallicity absorbers have physical properties similar to massive star-forming galaxies and are embedded in enriched neutral hydrogen gas reservoirs that extend well beyond the star-forming interstellar medium of these galaxies.</p>

The multiple merger assembly of a hyperluminous obscured quasar at redshift 4.6
<p>Galaxy mergers and gas accretion from the cosmic web drove the growth of galaxies and their central black holes at early epochs. We report spectroscopic imaging of a multiple merger event in the most luminous known galaxy, WISE J224607.56−052634.9 (W2246−0526), a dust-obscured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quasar</span></strong> at redshift 4.6, 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang. Far-infrared dust continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246−0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of dust likely produced by the dynamical interaction. The detection of tidal dusty bridges shows that W2246−0526 is accreting its neighbors, suggesting that merger activity may be a dominant mechanism through which the most luminous galaxies simultaneously obscure and feed their central supermassive black holes.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion covering all major types of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion are species-specific, with signatures of balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in humans within its larger evolutionary context. The global map of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in our closest living relatives is available as an interactive browser at <ext-link>http://tinyurl.com/nf8qmzh</ext-link>.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for either an increase or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV proteins promote stomatal development and ectopically induce stomata beyond the epidermis
<p>The shoot epidermis of land plants serves as a crucial interface between plants and the atmosphere: pavement cells protect plants from desiccation and other environmental stresses, while stomata facilitate gas exchange and transpiration. Advances have been made in our understanding of stomatal patterning and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, and a set of ‘master regulatory’ transcription factors of stomatal development have been identified. However, they are limited to specifying stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation within the epidermis. Here, we report the identification of an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) protein, HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS2 (HDG2), as a key epidermal component promoting stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. HDG2 is highly enriched in meristemoids, which are transient-amplifying populations of stomatal-cell lineages. Ectopic expression of <i>HDG2</i> confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of stomata in internal mesophyll tissues and occasional multiple epidermal layers. Conversely, a loss-of-function <i>hdg2</i> mutation delays stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and, rarely but consistently, results in aberrant stomata. A closely related <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> gene, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1</i> (<i>AtML1</i>), shares overlapping function with <i>HDG2</i>: <i>AtML1</i> overexpression also triggers ectopic stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation in the mesophyll layer and <i>atml1</i> mutation enhances the stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation defects of <i>hdg2</i>. Consistently, HDG2 and AtML1 bind the same DNA elements, and activate transcription in yeast. Furthermore, HDG2 transactivates expression of genes that regulate stomatal development <i>in planta</i>. Our study highlights the similarities and uniqueness of these two <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> genes in the specification of protodermal identity and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation beyond predetermined tissue layers.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. As cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Induction of CD4 T cell memory by local cellular collectivity
<p>Cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is directed by signals driving progenitors into specialized cell types. This process can involve collective decision-making, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating cells determine their lineage choice by interacting with each other. We used live-cell imaging in microwell arrays to study collective processes affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into memory precursors. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of precursor memory T cells sharply increases above a threshold number of locally interacting cells. These homotypic interactions involve the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, which affect memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation orthogonal to their effect on proliferation and survival. Mathematical modeling suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation rate is continuously modulated by the instantaneous number of locally interacting cells. This cellular collectivity can prioritize allocation of immune memory to stronger responses.</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic oscillator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. We probed centriole amplification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic oscillator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, whereas excessive activity accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic oscillator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation.</p>

Microstructural proliferation in human cortex is coupled with the development of face processing
<p>How does cortical tissue change as brain function and behavior improve from childhood to adulthood? By combining quantitative and functional magnetic resonance imaging in children and adults, we find <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al development of high-level visual areas that are involved in face and place recognition. Development of face-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive regions, but not place-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive regions, is dominated by microstructural proliferation. This tissue development is correlated with specific increases in functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ivity to faces, as well as improvements in face recognition, and ultimately leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated tissue properties between face- and place-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive regions in adulthood, which we validate with postmortem cytoarchitectonic measurements.

Transcription Factors VND1-VND3 Contribute to Cotyledon Xylem Vessel Formation
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN1</i> (<i>VND1</i>) to <i>VND7</i> encode a group of NAC domain transcription factors that function as master regulators of xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. These transcription factors activate the transcription of genes required for secondary cell wall formation and programmed cell death, key events in xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Because constitutive overexpression of VND6 and VND7 induces ectopic xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, functional studies of VND proteins have largely focused on these two proteins. Here, we report the roles of VND1, VND2, and VND3 in xylem vessel formation in cotyledons. Using our newly established in vitro system in which excised Arabidopsis cotyledons are stimulated to undergo xylem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation by cytokinin, auxin, and brassinosteroid treatment, we found that ectopic xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation required VND1, VND2, and VND3 but not VND6 or VND7. The importance of VND1, VND2, and VND3 also was indicated in vivo; in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> seedlings, xylem vessel element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of secondary veins in cotyledons was inhibited under dark conditions. Furthermore, the light responsiveness of <i>VND</i> gene expression was disturbed in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> mutant, and <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> failed to recover lateral root development in response to the change of light conditions. These findings suggest that VND1 to VND3 have specific molecular functions, possibly linking light conditions to xylem vessel formation, during seedling development.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short reads from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides reliable allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest pressure remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a pressure on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressure. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressure had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. We investigated how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation increased cell mitochondrial activity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation was associated with an increase in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

Autocrine Wnt regulates the survival and genomic stability of embryonic stem cells
<p>Wnt signaling plays an important role in the self-renewal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of stem cells. The secretion of Wnt ligands requires Evi (also known as Wls). Genetically ablating Evi provides an experimental approach to studying the consequence of depleting all redundant Wnt proteins, and overexpressing Evi enables a nonspecific means of increasing Wnt signaling. We generated Evi-deficient and Evi-overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to analyze the role of autocrine Wnt production in self-renewal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Self-renewal was reduced in Evi-deficient ESCs and increased in Evi-overexpressing ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, which supports the self-renewal of ESCs. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of ESCs into cardiomyocytes was enhanced when Evi was overexpressed and teratoma formation and growth of Evi-deficient ESCs in vivo were impaired, indicating that autocrine Wnt ligands were necessary for ESC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and survival. ESCs lacking autocrine Wnt signaling had mitotic defects and showed genomic instability. Together, our study demonstrates that autocrine Wnt secretion is important for the survival, chromosomal stability, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, and tumorigenic potential of ESCs.</p>

Predator-driven natural selection on risk-taking behavior in anole lizards
<p>Biologists have long debated the role of behavior in evolution, yet understanding of its role as a driver of adaptation is hampered by the scarcity of experimental studies of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on behavior in nature. After showing that individual <i>Anolis sagrei</i> lizards vary consistently in risk-taking behaviors, we experimentally established populations on eight small islands either with or without <i>Leiocephalus carinatus</i>, a major ground predator. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion predictably favors different risk-taking behaviors under different treatments: Exploratory behavior is favored in the absence of predators, whereas avoidance of the ground is favored in their presence. On predator islands, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on behavior is stronger than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on morphology, whereas the opposite holds on islands without predators. Our field experiment demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion can shape behavioral traits, paving the way toward adaptation to varying environmental contexts.</p>

Silencing stemness in T cell differentiation
<p>Functional diversity in multicellular organisms is achieved through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of stem cells. During this process, stem cells must retain both the capacity for self-renewal and the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate into highly specialized cell types to produce a diverse array of tissues, each with distinct functions and organization. This plasticity is achieved through alterations to the epigenome, heritable and reversible modifications to DNA and histones that affect chromatin structure and gene transcription without altering the DNA sequence itself. Alterations to the epigenome enable cell type–specific transcriptional control that can change dynamically over the life of a cell. Such flexibility and responsiveness are instrumental in directing gene expression changes throughout cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and lineage specification. The acquisition of more specialized functions during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation requires not only that the epigenome turn “on” genes involved in lineage commitment, it also necessitates that genes associated with stemness are simultaneously turned “off” (<i>1</i>). On page 177 of this issue, Pace <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) demonstrate that this phenomenon exists in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, in which epigenetic repression of stemness-associated genes by the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 is required for T cell effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Understanding these mechanisms addresses important questions in immunology and is applicable to cancer immunotherapy.</p>

Coupling organelle inheritance with mitosis to balance growth and differentiation
<p>Balancing growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is essential to tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis.

To address this issue, we identified transcripts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed in mouse basal epidermal progenitors versus their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating progeny and those altered in cancers. We used an in vivo RNA interference screen to unveil candidates that altered the equilibrium between the basal proliferative layer and suprabasal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating layers forming the skin barrier. We found that epidermal progenitors deficient in the peroxisome-associated protein Pex11b failed to segregate peroxisomes properly and entered a mitotic delay that perturbed polarized divisions and skewed daughter fates. Together, our findings unveil a role for organelle inheritance in mitosis, spindle alignment, and the choice of daughter progenitors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate or remain stem-like.</p>

Cyst Nematode Parasitism Induces Dynamic Changes in the Root Epigenome
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic modifications can provide efficient, dynamic, and reversible cellular responses to a wide range of environmental stimuli. However, the significance of epigenetic modifications in plant-pathogen interactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of epigenome changes during the compatible interaction between the beet cyst nematode <i>Heterodera schachtii</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted to assess the dynamic changes in the methylome of Arabidopsis roots in response to <i>H. schachtii</i> infection. <i>H. schachtii</i> induced widespread hypomethylation of protein-coding genes and transposable elements (TEs), preferentially those adjacent to protein-coding genes. The abundance of 24-nt siRNAs was associated with hypermethylation of TEs and gene promoters, with influence observed for methylation context and infection time points. mRNA sequencing revealed a significant enrichment for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally methylated genes among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes, specifically those with functions corresponding to primary metabolic processes and responses to stimuli. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally methylated genes overlapped with more than one-fourth of the syncytium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes and are of functional significance. Together, our results provide intriguing insights into the potential regulatory role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al DNA methylation in shaping the biological interplay between cyst nematodes and host plants.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion framework, attempts to explicitly account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Selective Sweeps across Twenty Millions Years of Primate Evolution
<p>The contribution from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps to variation in genetic diversity has proven notoriously difficult to assess, in part because polymorphism data only allows detection of sweeps in the most recent few hundred thousand years. Here, we show how linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in ancestral species can be quantified across evolutionary timescales by analyzing patterns of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) along the genomes of closely related species. We show that sweeps in the human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors can be identified as depletions of ILS in regions in excess of 100 kb in length. Sweeps predicted in each ancestral species, as well as recurrent sweeps predicted in both species, often overlap sweeps predicted in humans. This suggests that many genomic regions experience recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps. By comparing the ILS patterns along the genomes of the closely related human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors, we are further able to quantify the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps relative to that of background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Compared with the human–orangutan ancestor, the human–chimpanzee ancestor shows a strong excess of regions depleted of ILS as well as a stronger reduction in ILS around genes. We conclude that sweeps play a strong role in reducing diversity along the genome and that sweeps have reduced diversity in the human–chimpanzee ancestor much more than in the human–orangutan ancestor.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and more widespread positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

Body size downgrading of mammals over the late Quaternary
<p>Since the late Pleistocene, large-bodied mammals have been extirpated from much of Earth. Although all habitable continents once harbored giant mammals, the few remaining species are largely confined to Africa. This decline is coincident with the global expansion of hominins over the late Quaternary. Here, we quantify mammalian extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ivity, continental body size distributions, and taxonomic diversity over five time periods spanning the past 125,000 years and stretching approximately 200 years into the future. We demonstrate that size-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive extinction was already under way in the oldest interval and occurred on all continents, within all trophic modes, and across all time intervals. Moreover, the degree of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ivity was unprecedented in 65 million years of mammalian evolution. The distinctive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ivity signature implicates hominin activity as a primary driver of taxonomic losses and ecosystem homogenization. Because megafauna have a disproportionate influence on ecosystem structure and function, past and present body size downgrading is reshaping Earth’s biosphere.</p>

Natural selection and the predictability of evolution in <i>Timema</i> stick insects
<p>Predicting evolution remains difficult. We studied the evolution of cryptic body coloration and pattern in a stick insect using 25 years of field data, experiments, and genomics. We found that evolution is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions than when it involves feedback loops that cause consistent back-and-forth fluctuations. Specifically, changes in color-morph frequencies are modestly predictable through time (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.14) and driven by complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive regimes and yearly fluctuations in climate. In contrast, temporal changes in pattern-morph frequencies are highly predictable due to negative frequency-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.86). For both traits, however, natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion drives evolution around a dynamic equilibrium, providing some predictability to the process.</p>

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Neuronal birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the neurons that constitute neural circuits. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual systems. Photoreceptors achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina neurons, with a secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between photoreceptors and lamina cells requires a signaling relay through glia. In response to photoreceptor-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating neuronal development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina neuron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

Winter storms drive rapid phenotypic, regulatory, and genomic shifts in the green anole lizard

Negative selection in humans and fruit flies involves synergistic epistasis
<p>Negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion against deleterious alleles produced by mutation influences within-population variation as the most pervasive form of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. However, it is not known whether deleterious alleles affect fitness independently, so that cumulative fitness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative fitness. Negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion with synergistic epistasis should produce negative linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles and, therefore, an underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function alleles in eight independent data sets from human and fly populations. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion against rare protein-disrupting alleles is characterized by synergistic epistasis, which may explain how human and fly populations persist despite high genomic mutation rates.</p>

The genomic landscape of rapid repeated evolutionary adaptation to toxic pollution in wild fish
<p>Atlantic killifish populations have rapidly adapted to normally lethal levels of pollution in four urban estuaries. Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–based signaling pathway as a shared target of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. This suggests evolutionary constraint on adaptive solutions to complex toxicant mixtures at each site. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to adaptive pathway modification among tolerant populations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion also targets other toxicity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance phenotypes and potentially compensatory adaptations. Molecular changes are consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on standing genetic variation. In killifish, high nucleotide diversity has likely been a crucial substrate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps to propel rapid adaptation.</p>

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit
<p>Knowledge of the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the RNA level is limited. Here, we used RNA sequencing analysis to compare representative sets of wild, landrace, and improved accessions of pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i>) to gain insight into the genetic changes associated with domestication and improvement. A close population relationship and similar nucleotide diversity was observed between the wild and landrace groups, whereas the improved group had substantially reduced nucleotide diversity. A total of 11.13 Mb of genome sequence was identified as bearing the signature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps that occurred during pear domestication, whereas a distinct and smaller set of genomic regions (4.04 Mb) was identified as being associated with subsequent improvement efforts. The expression diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed genes exhibited a 20.89% reduction from the wild group to the landrace group, but a 23.13% recovery was observed from the landrace to the improved group, showing a distinctly different pattern with variation of sequence diversity. Module-trait association analysis identified 16 distinct coexpression modules, six of which were highly associated with important fruit traits. The candidate trait-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed genes associated with stone cell formation, fruit size, and sugar content were identified in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed regions, and many of these could also be mapped to the previously reported quantitative trait loci. Thus, our study reveals the specific pattern of domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the transcriptome level, and provides valuable genetic sources of fruit traits that could contribute to pear breeding and improvement.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

<p>In disease dynamics, high immune gene diversity can confer a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin genes were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five genes showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these genes in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin gene (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this gene, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin genes allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune genes, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to invertebrate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong> pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
From shape to cells: mouse models reveal mechanisms altering palate development in Apert syndrome
<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by severe skull malformations and caused by one of two missense mutations, S252W and P253R, on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The molecular bases underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al Apert syndrome phenotypes are still poorly understood and it is unclear why cleft palate is more frequent in patients carrying the S252W mutation. Taking advantage of Apert syndrome mouse models, we performed a novel combination of morphometric, histological and immunohistochemical analyses to precisely quantify distinct palatal phenotypes in <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> and <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></i> mice. We localized regions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally altered FGF signaling and assessed local cell patterns to establish a baseline for understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al effects of these two <i>Fgfr2</i> mutations. Palatal suture scoring and comparative 3D shape analysis from high resolution μCT images of 120 newborn mouse skulls showed that <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> mice display relatively more severe palate dysmorphologies, with contracted and more separated palatal shelves, a greater tendency to fuse the maxillary-palatine sutures and aberrant development of the inter-premaxillary suture. These palatal defects are associated with suture-specific patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and apoptosis. The posterior region of the developing palate emerges as a potential target for therapeutic strategies in clinical management of cleft palate in Apert syndrome patients.</p>

The tissue-specific transcriptomic landscape of the mid-gestational mouse embryo
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al gene expression is a prerequisite for the formation of multiple cell types from the fertilized egg during embryogenesis. Understanding the gene regulatory networks controlling cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation requires the identification of crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ally expressed control genes and, ideally, the determination of the complete transcriptomes of each individual cell type. Here, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of six major tissues dissected from mid-gestational (TS12) mouse embryos. Approximately one billion reads derived by RNA-seq analysis provided extended transcript lengths, novel first exons and alternative transcripts of known genes. We have identified 1375 genes showing tissue-specific expression, providing gene signatures for each of the six tissues. In addition, we have identified 1403 novel putative long noncoding RNA gene loci, 439 of which show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>al expression. Our analysis provides the first complete transcriptome data for the mouse embryo. It offers a rich data source for the analysis of individual genes and gene regulatory networks controlling mid-gestational development.</p>

Ssrp1a controls organogenesis by promoting cell cycle progression and RNA synthesis
<p>Tightly controlled DNA replication and RNA transcription are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and tissue growth in multicellular organisms. Histone chaperones, including the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex, are central for these processes and act by mediating DNA access through nucleosome reorganisation. However, their roles in vertebrate organogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of zebrafish mutants for the gene encoding Structure specific recognition protein 1a (Ssrp1a), which, together with Spt16, forms the FACT heterodimer. Focussing on the liver and eye, we show that zygotic Ssrp1a is essential for proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation during organogenesis. Specifically, gene expression indicative of progressive organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation is disrupted and RNA transcription is globally reduced. Ssrp1a-deficient embryos exhibit DNA synthesis defects and prolonged S phase, uncovering a role distinct from that of Spt16, which promotes G<sub>1</sub> phase progression. Gene deletion/replacement experiments in <i>Drosophila</i> show that Ssrp1b, Ssrp1a and N-terminal Ssrp1a, equivalent to the yeast homologue Pob3, can substitute <i>Drosophila</i> Ssrp function. These data suggest that (1) Ssrp1b does not compensate for Ssrp1a loss in the zebrafish embryo, probably owing to insufficient expression levels, and (2) despite fundamental structural differences, the mechanisms mediating DNA accessibility by FACT are conserved between yeast and metazoans. We propose that the essential functions of Ssrp1a in DNA replication and gene transcription, together with its dynamic spatiotemporal expression, ensure organ-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and proportional growth, which are crucial for the forming embryo.</p>

Migration of <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal stem cells across organ boundaries
<p>All components of the <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal tract, including the endodermal midgut and ectodermal hindgut/Malpighian tubules, maintain populations of dividing stem cells. In the midgut and hindgut, these stem cells originate from within larger populations of intestinal progenitors that proliferate during the larval stage and form the adult intestine during metamorphosis. The origin of stem cells found in the excretory Malpighian tubules (‘renal stem cells’) has not been established. In this paper, we investigate the migration patterns of intestinal progenitors that take place during metamorphosis. Our data demonstrate that a subset of adult midgut progenitors (AMPs) move posteriorly to form the adult ureters and, consecutively, the renal stem cells. Inhibiting cell migration by AMP-directed expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 protein results in the absence of stem cells in the Malpighian tubules. As the majority of the hindgut progenitor cells migrate posteriorly and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate into hindgut enterocytes, a group of the progenitor cells, unexpectedly, invades anteriorly into the midgut territory. Consequently, these progenitor cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate into midgut enterocytes. The midgut determinant <i>GATAe</i> is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of midgut enterocytes derived from hindgut progenitors. Wingless signaling acts to balance the proportion of hindgut progenitors that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate as midgut versus hindgut enterocytes. Our findings indicate that a stable boundary between midgut and hindgut/Malpighian tubules is not established during early embryonic development; instead, pluripotent progenitor populations cross in between these organs in both directions, and are able to adopt the fate of the organ in which they come to reside.</p>

Rapid and widespread suppression of self-renewal by microRNA-203 during epidermal differentiation
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of stem cells. However, the precise dynamics of miRNA induction during stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation have not been visualized and molecular mechanisms through which miRNAs execute their function remain unclear. Using high-resolution <i>in situ</i> hybridization together with cell lineage and proliferation markers in mouse skin, we show that miR-203 is transcriptionally activated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ating daughter cells upon the asymmetric cell division of interfollicular progenitor cells. Once induced, miR-203 rapidly promotes the cell cycle exit within 6 hours and abolishes self-renewal of the progenitor cells. With an inducible mouse model, we identify numerous miR-203 <i>in vivo</i> targets that are highly enriched in regulation of cell cycle and cell division, as well as in response to DNA damage. Importantly, co-suppression of individual targets, including p63, Skp2 and Msi2 by miR-203 is required for its function of promoting the cell cycle exit and inhibiting the long-term proliferation. Together, our findings reveal the rapid and widespread impact of miR-203 on the self-renewal program and provide mechanistic insights into the potent role of miR-203 during the epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation. These results should also contribute to understanding the role of miR-203 in the development of skin cancer.</p>

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers.

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix gel substantially improved long-term survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and vessel-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Functional Definition of Progenitors Versus Mature Endothelial Cells Reveals Key SoxF-Dependent Differentiation Process

EVP cells arose from vascular-resident beds that could not be transferred by bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, EVP displayed progenitor-like status with a high proportion of cells in a quiescent cell cycle phase as assessed in wounds, tumors, and aorta. Only EVP cells and not TA and D cells had self-renewal capacity as demonstrated by colony-forming capacity in limiting dilution and by transplantation in Matrigel plugs in recipient mice. RNA sequencing revealed prominent gene expression differences between EVP and D cells. In particular, EVP cells highly expressed genes related to progenitor function including <i>Sox9</i>, <i>Il33</i>, <i>Egfr</i>, and <i>Pdfgrα.</i> Conversely, D cells highly expressed genes related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ated endothelium including <i>Ets1&2</i>, <i>Gata2</i>, <i>Cd31</i>, <i>Vwf</i>, and <i>Notch</i>.

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize patient management, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk patients. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">differenti</span></strong>ation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart failure, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart failure (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was analyzed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart failure was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles.

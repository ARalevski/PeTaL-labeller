High glucose–induced ROS activates TRPM2 to trigger lysosomal membrane permeabilization and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mitochondrial fission
<p>Diabetic stress increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation and dysfunction. We hypothesized that ROS-sensitive TRPM2 channels mediated diabetic stress–induced mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation. We found that chemical inhibitors, RNAi silencing, and genetic knockout of TRPM2 channels abolished the ability of high glucose to cause mitochondrial fission in endothelial cells, a cell type that is particularly vulnerable to diabetic stress. Similar to high glucose, increasing ROS in endothelial cells by applying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced mitochondrial fission. Ca<sup>2+</sup> that entered through TRPM2 induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization, which led to the release of lysosomal Zn<sup>2+</sup> and a subsequent increase in mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Zn<sup>2+</sup> promoted the recruitment of the fission factor Drp-1 to mitochondria to trigger their fission. This signaling pathway may operate in aging-associated illnesses in which excessive mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation plays a central role.</p>

Is the cell's garbage disposal sending messages?
<p>The cellular structure known as the proteasome breaks down unneeded and damaged proteins so their remains can be recycled. A new study suggests that the proteasome also has a surprising function—it allows neurons to transmit messages to other cells. Proteasomes normally remain in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, but the authors of the study identified proteasomes in neurons that are located at the cell membrane and release protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s into the cell’s surroundings.

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Loss of MCU prevents mitochondrial fusion in G<sub>1</sub>-S phase and blocks cell cycle progression and proliferation
<p>The role of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) in physiologic cell proliferation remains to be defined. Here, we demonstrated that the MCU was required to match mitochondrial function to metabolic demands during the cell cycle. During the G<sub>1</sub>-S transition (the cycle phase with the highest mitochondrial ATP output), mitochondrial fusion, oxygen consumption, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake increased in wild-type cells but not in cells lacking MCU. In proliferating wild-type control cells, the addition of the growth factors promoted the activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and the phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 at Ser<sup>616</sup>. The lack of the MCU was associated with baseline activation of CaMKII, mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation due to increased Drp1 phosphorylation, and impaired mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. The mitochondrial fission/fusion ratio and proliferation in MCU-deficient cells recovered after MCU restoration or inhibition of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation or of CaMKII in the cytosol. Our data highlight a key function for the MCU in mitochondrial adaptation to the metabolic demands during cell cycle progression.

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation rules of lipids into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s with conserved synteny and matched these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and drug-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and drug-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

Quantitative assay for TALEN activity at endogenous genomic loci
<p>Artificially designed nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) can induce a targeted DNA double-strand break at the specific target genomic locus, leading to the frameshift-mediated gene disruption. However, the assays for their activity on the endogenous genomic loci remain limited. Herein, we describe a versatile modified <i>lacZ</i> assay to detect frameshifts in the nuclease target site. Short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s of the genome DNA at the target or putative off-target loci were amplified from the genomic DNA of TALEN-treated or control embryos, and were inserted into the <i>lacZα</i> sequence for the conventional blue–white selection. The frequency of the frameshifts in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> can be estimated from the numbers of blue and white colonies.

The surface composition of asteroid 162173 Ryugu from Hayabusa2 near-infrared spectroscopy
<p>The near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu, the target of the Hayabusa2 sample-return mission, is thought to be a primitive carbonaceous object. We report reflectance spectra of Ryugu’s surface acquired with the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) on Hayabusa2, to provide direct measurements of the surface composition and geological context for the returned samples. A weak, narrow absorption feature centered at 2.72 micrometers was detected across the entire observed surface, indicating that hydroxyl (OH)–bearing minerals are ubiquitous there. The intensity of the OH feature and low albedo are similar to thermally and/or shock-metamorphosed carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. There are few variations in the OH-band position, which is consistent with Ryugu being a compositionally homogeneous rubble-pile object generated from impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s of an undifferentiated aqueously altered parent body.</p>

Functional degradation: A mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation by diverse pathogen enzymes
<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that initiate innate immunity by recruitment and activation of caspase-1. The NLRP1B inflammasome is activated upon direct cleavage by the anthrax lethal toxin protease. However, the mechanism by which cleavage results in NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we find that cleavage results in proteasome-mediated degradation of the amino-terminal domains of NLRP1B, liberating a carboxyl-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> that is a potent caspase-1 activator. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NLRP1B is both necessary and sufficient for NLRP1B activation. Consistent with our functional degradation model, we identify IpaH7.8, a <i>Shigella flexneri</i> ubiquitin ligase secreted effector, as an enzyme that induces NLRP1B degradation and activation. Our results provide a unified mechanism for NLRP1B activation by diverse pathogen-encoded enzymatic activities.</p>

Structures and operating principles of the replisome
<p>Visualization in atomic detail of the replisome that performs concerted leading– and lagging–DNA strand synthesis at a replication fork has not been reported. Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures up to 3.2-angstroms resolution of helicase translocating along DNA and of helicase-polymerase-primase complexes engaging in synthesis of both DNA strands. Each domain of the spiral-shaped hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-stranded DNA coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-strand polymerases are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> synthesis in tandem. A β hairpin from the leading-strand polymerase separates two parental DNA strands into a T-shaped fork, thus enabling the closely coupled helicase to advance perpendicular to the downstream DNA duplex.

E-C coupling structural protein junctophilin-2 encodes a stress-adaptive transcription regulator
<p>Junctophilin-2 (JP2) is a structural protein required for normal excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. After cardiac stress, JP2 is cleaved by the calcium ion–dependent protease calpain, which disrupts the E-C coupling ultrastructural machinery and drives heart failure progression. We found that stress-induced proteolysis of JP2 liberates an N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> (JP2NT) that translocates to the nucleus, binds to genomic DNA, and controls expression of a spectrum of genes in cardiomyocytes. Transgenic overexpression of JP2NT in mice modifies the transcriptional profile, resulting in attenuated pathological remodeling in response to cardiac stress. Conversely, loss of nuclear JP2NT function accelerates stress-induced development of hypertrophy and heart failure in mutant mice. These data reveal a self-protective mechanism in failing cardiomyocytes that transduce mechanical information (E-C uncoupling) into salutary transcriptional reprogramming in the stressed heart.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Pathogen blockade of TAK1 triggers caspase-8–dependent cleavage of gasdermin D and cell death
<p>Limited proteolysis of gasdermin D (GSDMD) generates an N-terminal pore-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> that controls pyroptosis in macrophages. GSDMD is processed via inflammasome-activated caspase-1 or -11. It is currently unknown whether macrophage GSDMD can be processed by other mechanisms. Here, we describe an additional pathway controlling GSDMD processing. The inhibition of TAK1 or IκB kinase (IKK) by the <i>Yersinia</i> effector protein YopJ elicits RIPK1- and caspase-8–dependent cleavage of GSDMD, which subsequently results in cell death. GSDMD processing also contributes to the NLRP3 inflammasome–dependent release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Thus, caspase-8 acts as a regulator of GSDMD-driven cell death. Furthermore, this study establishes the importance of TAK1 and IKK activity in the control of GSDMD cleavage and cytotoxicity.</p>

Heterobiaryl synthesis by contractive C–C coupling via P(V) intermediates
<p>Heterobiaryls composed of pyridine and diazine rings are key components of pharmaceuticals and are often central to pharmacological function. We present an alternative approach to metal-catalyzed cross-coupling to make heterobiaryls using contractive phosphorus C–C couplings, also termed phosphorus ligand coupling reactions. The process starts by regioselective phosphorus substitution of the C–H bonds para to nitrogen in two successive heterocycles; ligand coupling is then triggered via acidic alcohol solutions to form the heterobiaryl bond. Mechanistic studies imply that ligand coupling is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso position of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex drug-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent coupling of drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

Modeling the ecology and evolution of biodiversity: Biogeographical cradles, museums, and graves
<p>Individual processes shaping geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical models and traditional experiments. To meet this challenge, we built a spatially explicit, mechanistic simulation model implementing adaptation, range shifts, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation, speciation, dispersal, competition, and extinction, driven by modeled climates of the past 800,000 years in South America. Experimental topographic smoothing confirmed the impact of climate heterogeneity on diversification. The simulations identified regions and episodes of speciation (cradles), persistence (museums), and extinction (graves). Although the simulations had no target pattern and were not parameterized with empirical data, emerging richness maps closely resembled contemporary maps for major taxa, confirming powerful roles for evolution and diversification driven by topography and climate.</p>

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image wave-packet trajectories through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-photon and two-photon excitation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-photon channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear wave packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-photon channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> in multiple nuclear dimensions.

A radical approach to the copper oxidative addition problem: Trifluoromethylation of bromoarenes
<p>Transition metal–catalyzed arene functionalization has been widely used for molecular synthesis over the past century. In this arena, copper catalysis has long been considered a privileged platform due to the propensity of high-valent copper to undergo reductive elimination with a wide variety of coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s. However, the sluggish nature of oxidative addition has limited copper’s capacity to broadly facilitate haloarene coupling protocols. Here, we demonstrate that this copper oxidative addition problem can be overcome with an aryl radical–capture mechanism, wherein the aryl radical is generated through a silyl radical halogen abstraction. This strategy was applied to a general trifluoromethylation of aryl bromides through dual copper-photoredox catalysis. Mechanistic studies support the formation of an open-shell aryl species.</p>

Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by <i>Clostridium difficile</i> toxin B
<p><i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in developed countries. The major virulence factor, <i>C. difficile</i> toxin B (TcdB), targets colonic epithelia by binding to the frizzled (FZD) family of Wnt receptors, but how TcdB recognizes FZDs is unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of a TcdB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> in complex with the cysteine-rich domain of human FZD2 at 2.5-angstrom resolution, which reveals an endogenous FZD-bound fatty acid acting as a co-receptor for TcdB binding. This lipid occupies the binding site for Wnt-adducted palmitoleic acid in FZDs. TcdB binding locks the lipid in place, preventing Wnt from engaging FZDs and signaling. Our findings establish a central role of fatty acids in FZD-mediated TcdB pathogenesis and suggest strategies to modulate Wnt signaling.</p>

MFN2 agonists reverse mitochondrial defects in preclinical models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A
<p>Mitofusins (MFNs) promote fusion-mediated mitochondrial content exchange and subcellular trafficking. Mutations in <i>Mfn2</i> cause neurodegenerative Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A).

High-energy, high-fat lifestyle challenges an Arctic apex predator, the polar bear
<p>Regional declines in polar bear (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) populations have been attributed to changing sea ice conditions, but with limited information on the causative mechanisms. By simultaneously measuring field metabolic rates, daily activity patterns, body condition, and foraging success of polar bears moving on the spring sea ice, we found that high metabolic rates (1.6 times greater than previously assumed) coupled with low intake of fat-rich marine mammal prey resulted in an energy deficit for more than half of the bears examined. Activity and movement on the sea ice strongly influenced metabolic demands. Consequently, increases in mobility resulting from ongoing and forecasted declines in and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation of sea ice are likely to increase energy demands and may be an important factor explaining observed declines in body condition and survival.</p>

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex

We present crystal structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product integration complexes, as well as a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the full CRISPR locus integration complex, including the accessory protein IHF (integration host factor). The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates integration site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of integration. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR integrase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA structure to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale mold conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human mold pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

The determination of which asteroids of the remaining population are members of undiscovered families, or accreted as planetesimals from the protoplanetary disk, would constrain a critical phase of planetary formation by unveiling the unknown planetesimal size distribution. We discovered a 4-billion-year-old asteroid family extending across the entire inner part of the main belt whose members include most of the dark asteroids previously unlinked to families. This allows us to identify some original planetesimals, which are all larger than 35 kilometers, supporting the view of asteroids being born big. Their number matches the known distinct meteorite parent bodies.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)

Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids.

De novo design of a biologically active amyloid
<p>Most human proteins possess amyloidogenic segments, but only about 30 are associated with amyloid-associated pathologies, and it remains unclear what determines amyloid toxicity.

Vascin recapitulates key biophysical and biochemical characteristics of natural amyloids, penetrates cells, and seeds the aggregation of VEGFR2 through direct interaction. We found that amyloid toxicity is observed only in cells that both express VEGFR2 and are dependent on VEGFR2 activity for survival. Thus, amyloid toxicity here appears to be both protein-specific and conditional—determined by VEGFR2 loss of function in a biological context in which target protein function is essential.</p>

A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
<p>Inhibition or genetic deletion of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is protective against toxic insults in many organ systems. The molecular mechanisms underlying PARP-1–dependent cell death involve release of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and its translocation to the nucleus, which results in chromatinolysis. We identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a PARP-1–dependent AIF-associated nuclease (PAAN). AIF was required for recruitment of MIF to the nucleus, where MIF cleaves genomic DNA into large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s. Depletion of MIF, disruption of the AIF-MIF interaction, or mutation of glutamic acid at position 22 in the catalytic nuclease domain blocked MIF nuclease activity and inhibited chromatinolysis, cell death induced by glutamate excitotoxicity, and focal stroke. Inhibition of MIF’s nuclease activity is a potential therapeutic target for diseases caused by excessive PARP-1 activation.</p>

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their assembly in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels, selectively binds with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its assembly in complex. How SEC11 binding is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE binding site. Here, we identify a second binding motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 binding independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex assembly.</p>

The Largest Subunit of DNA Polymerase Delta Is Required for Normal Formation of Meiotic Type I Crossovers
<p>Meiotic recombination contributes to the maintenance of the association between homologous chromosomes (homologs) and ensures the accurate segregation of homologs during anaphase I, thus facilitating the redistribution of alleles among progeny. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double strand breaks, the repair of which requires DNA synthesis, but the role of DNA synthesis proteins during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the lagging strand-specific DNA Polymerase δ (POL δ) might be required for meiotic recombination, based on a previous analysis of DNA Replication Factor1 that suggested a role for lagging strand synthesis in meiotic recombination. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), complete mutation of the catalytic subunit of POL δ, encoded by <i>AtPOLD1</i>, leads to embryo lethality. Therefore, we used a meiocyte-specific knockdown strategy to test this hypothesis. Reduced expression of <i>AtPOLD1</i> in meiocytes caused decreased fertility and meiotic defects, including incomplete synapsis, the formation of multivalents, chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation, and improper segregation. Analysis of meiotic crossover (CO) frequencies showed that <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> plants had significantly fewer interference-sensitive COs than the wild type, indicating that AtPOL δ participates in type I CO formation. <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup> atpol2a</i> double mutant meiocytes displayed more severe meiotic phenotypes than those of either single mutant, suggesting that the function of AtPOLD1 and AtPOL2A is not identical in meiotic recombination. Given that POL δ is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we hypothesize that the described role of POL δ here in meiotic recombination likely exists widely in eukaryotes.</p>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become positioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear positioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear positioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the positioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear positioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ed and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant positioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear positioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear positioning in leaf cells.</p>

The Photosystem II Repair Cycle Requires FtsH Turnover through the EngA GTPase
<p>Specific degradation of photodamaged D1, the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein, is a crucial step in the PSII repair cycle to maintain photosynthesis activity. Processive proteolysis by the FtsH protease is fundamental to cooperative D1 degradation. Here, we attempted to purify the FtsH complex to elucidate its regulation mechanisms and substrate recognition in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Unlike previously reported prokaryotic and mitochondrial FtsHs, the Arabidopsis chloroplastic FtsH does not appear to form a megacomplex with prohibition-like proteins but instead accumulates as smaller complexes. The copurified fraction was enriched with a partial PSII intermediate presumably undergoing repair, although its precise properties were not fully clarified. In addition, we copurified a bacteria-type GTPase localized in chloroplasts, EngA, and confirmed its interaction with FtsH by subsequent pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. While the <i>engA</i> mutation is embryo lethal, the transgenic lines overexpressing EngA (EngA-OX) showed leaf variegation reminiscent of the variegated mutant lacking FtsH2. EngA-OX was revealed to accumulate more cleaved D1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s and reactive oxygen species than the wild type, indicative of compromised PSII repair. Based on these results and the fact that FtsH becomes more stable in EngA-OX, we propose that EngA negatively regulates FtsH stability. We demonstrate that proper FtsH turnover is crucial for PSII repair in the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis. Consistent with the increased turnover of FtsH under high-light conditions in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, our findings underline the rapid turnover of not only D1 but also FtsH proteases in the PSII repair cycle.</p>

Physio-Genetic Dissection of Dark-Induced Leaf Senescence and Timing Its Reversal in Barley
<p>Barley crop model was analyzed for early and late events during the dark-induced leaf senescence (DILS) as well as for deciphering critical time limit for reversal of the senescence process. Chlorophyll fluorescence vitality index Rfd was determined as the earliest parameter that correlated well with the cessation of photosynthesis prior to microautophagy symptoms, initiation of DNA degradation, and severalfold increase in the endonuclease <i>BNUC1.</i> DILS was found characterized by up-regulation of processes that enable recycling of degraded macromolecules and metabolites, including increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> remobilization, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and partial up-regulation of glyoxylate and tricarboxylate acid cycles. The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-affinity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin condensation, more DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent.

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-terminal domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a folded segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric site revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation.

The myeloblastosis (MYB)-type transcription factors PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE1 (PHL1) were identified to bind to <i>P5CS1</i> regulatory sequences in the first intron, which carries a conserved PHR1-binding site (P1BS) motif. Binding of PHR1 and PHL1 factors to P1BS was confirmed by Y1H, electrophoretic mobility assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Phosphate starvation led to gradual increase in Pro content in wild-type Arabidopsis plants as well as transcriptional activation of <i>P5CS1</i> and PRO DEHYDROGENASE2 genes. Induction of <i>P5CS1</i> transcription and Pro accumulation during phosphate deficiency was considerably reduced by <i>phr1</i> and <i>phl1</i> mutations and was impaired in the ABA-deficient <i>aba2-3</i> and ABA-insensitive <i>abi4-1</i> mutants. Growth and viability of <i>phr1phl1</i> double mutant was significantly reduced in phosphate-depleted medium, while growth was only marginally affected in the <i>aba2-3</i> mutants, suggesting that ABA is implicated in growth retardation in such nutritional stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between Pro metabolism and phosphate nutrition and show that Pro biosynthesis is target of cross talk between ABA signaling and regulation of phosphate homeostasis through PHR1- and PHL1-mediated transcriptional activation of the <i>P5CS1</i> gene.</p>

GmILPA1, Encoding an APC8-like Protein, Controls Leaf Petiole Angle in Soybean<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf petiole angle (LPA) is an important plant architectural trait that affects canopy coverage, photosynthetic efficiency, and ultimately productivity in many legume crops. However, the genetic basis underlying this trait remains unclear. Here, we report the identification, isolation, and functional characterization of <i>Glycine max Increased Leaf Petiole Angle1</i> (<i>GmILPA1</i>), a gene encoding an APC8-like protein, which is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). A gamma ray-induced deletion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong> involving the fourth exon of <i>GmILPA1</i> and its flanking sequences led to extension of the third exon and formation of, to our knowledge, a novel 3′UTR from intronic and intergenic sequences. Such changes are responsible for enlarged LPAs that are associated with reduced motor cell proliferation in the <i>Gmilpa1</i> mutant. <i>GmILPA1</i> is mainly expressed in the basal cells of leaf primordia and appears to function by promoting cell growth and division of the pulvinus that is critical for its establishment. GmILPA1 directly interacts with GmAPC13a as part of the putative anaphase-promoting complex. <i>GmILPA1</i> exhibits variable expression levels among varieties with different degrees of LPAs, and expression levels are correlated with the degrees of the LPAs. Together, these observations revealed a genetic mechanism modulating the plant petiole angle that could pave the way for modifying soybean plant architecture with optimized petiole angles for enhanced yield potential.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein EMB2654 Is Essential for Trans-Splicing of a Chloroplast Small Ribosomal Subunit Transcript
<p>We report the partial complementation and subsequent comparative molecular analysis of two nonviable mutants impaired in chloroplast translation, one (<i>emb2394</i>) lacking the RPL6 protein, and the other (<i>emb2654</i>) carrying a mutation in a gene encoding a P-class pentatricopeptide repeat protein. We show that EMB2654 is required for the trans-splicing of the plastid <i>rps12</i> transcript and that therefore the <i>emb2654</i> mutant lacks Rps12 protein and fails to assemble the small subunit of the plastid ribosome, explaining the loss of plastid translation and consequent embryo-lethal phenotype. Predictions of the EMB2654 binding site match a small RNA “footprint” located on the 5′ half of the trans-spliced intron that is almost absent in the partially complemented mutant. EMB2654 binds sequence specifically to this target sequence in vitro. Altered patterns in nuclease-protected small RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>s in <i>emb2654</i> show that EMB2654 binding must be an early step in, or prior to, the formation of a large protein-RNA complex covering the free ends of the two <i>rps12</i> intron halves.</p>

Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice
<p><i>Phosphate overaccumulator2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in rice protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the “WCGPC” motif of Trxhs were required for the interaction. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts confirmed the interaction of OsPHO2 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and PHOSPHATE1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and rice seedlings. Characterization of rice <i>pho2</i> complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic <i>OsPHO2</i> or <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> (a constitutively reduced form) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>, indicated that <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native <i>OsPHO2</i>. Moreover, the suppression of <i>OsTrxh1</i> (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which fine-tune its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in rice.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ed hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex neuronal and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-based mechanisms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to rodents. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor neuron loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in neurons and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor neurons, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor neurons, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor neurons versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore sleep as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of sleep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fragment</span></strong></span></strong>ation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested mechanism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor neurons and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular mechanisms, which will be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p>

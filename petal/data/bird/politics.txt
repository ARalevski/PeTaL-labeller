Emergent simplicity in microbial community assembly
<p>A major unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the complex taxonomic architectures observed in surveys of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es can be explained and predicted by fundamental, quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es are highly predictable and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the assembly of large microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.</p>

The Global Cardiovascular Risk Transition
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>It is commonly assumed that cardiovascular disease risk factors are associated with affluence and Westernization. We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, and serum total cholesterol with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income, Western diet, and, for BMI, urbanization in 1980 and 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Country-level risk factor estimates for 199 countries between 1980 and 2008 were from a previous systematic analysis of population-based data. We analyzed the associations between risk factors and per capita <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income, a measure of Western diet, and, for BMI, the percentage of the population living in urban areas. In 1980, there was a positive association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and population mean BMI, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol. By 2008, the slope of the association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and systolic blood pressure became negative for women and zero for men. Total cholesterol was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and Western diet in both 1980 and 2008. In 1980, BMI rose with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and then flattened at ≈Int$7000; by 2008, the relationship resembled an inverted U for women, peaking at middle-income levels. BMI had a positive relationship with the percentage of urban population in both 1980 and 2008. Fasting plasma glucose had weaker associations with these country macro characteristics, but it was positively associated with BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The changing associations of metabolic risk factors with macroeconomic variables indicate that there will be a global pandemic of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, together with high blood pressure in low-income countries, unless effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are implemented.</p></sec>

Ocean biogeochemistry modeled with emergent trait-based genomics
<p>Marine ecosystem models have advanced to incorporate metabolic pathways discovered with genomic sequencing, but direct comparisons between models and “omics” data are lacking. We developed a model that directly simulates metagenomes and metatranscriptomes for comparison with observations. Model microbes were randomly assigned genes for specialized functions, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es of 68 species were simulated in the Atlantic Ocean. Unfit organisms were replaced, and the model self-organized to develop community genomes and transcriptomes. Emergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es from simulations that were initialized with different cohorts of randomly generated microbes all produced realistic vertical and horizontal ocean nutrient, genome, and transcriptome gradients. Thus, the library of gene functions available to the community, rather than the distribution of functions among specific organisms, drove community assembly and biogeochemical gradients in the model ocean.</p>

Structure, spatial dynamics, and stability of novel seed dispersal mutualistic networks in Hawai<bold></bold>i
<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species interactions. To investigate how such changes affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal networks on Oahu, Hawaii. Networks consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es. Furthermore, the structure and stability of the novel networks were similar to native-dominated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es worldwide. Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex network structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and environment. Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel networks, making restoration of native ecosystems more challenging than previously thought.</p>

Autonomous vehicles: No driver…no regulation?

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Agriculturally dominated landscapes reduce bee phylogenetic diversity and pollination services
<p>Land-use change threatens global biodiversity and may reshape the tree of life by favoring some lineages over others.

We address this knowledge gap using extensive genomic, community, and crop datasets to examine relationships among land use, pollinator phylogenetic structure, and crop production. Pollinator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es in highly agricultural landscapes contain 230 million fewer years of evolutionary history; this loss was strongly associated with reduced crop yield and quality. Our study links landscape–mediated changes in the phylogenetic structure of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es to the disruption of ecosystem services. Measuring conservation success by species counts alone may fail to protect ecosystem functions and the full diversity of life from which they are derived.</p>

Plio-Pleistocene decline of African megaherbivores: No evidence for ancient hominin impacts
<p>It has long been proposed that pre-modern hominin impacts drove extinctions and shaped the evolutionary history of Africa’s exceptionally diverse large mammal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es, but this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. We analyzed eastern African herbivore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es spanning the past 7 million years—encompassing the entirety of hominin evolutionary history—to test the hypothesis that top-down impacts of tool-bearing, meat-eating hominins contributed to the demise of megaherbivores prior to the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We document a steady, long-term decline of megaherbivores beginning ~4.6 million years ago, long before the appearance of hominin species capable of exerting top-down control of large mammal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es and predating evidence for hominin interactions with megaherbivore prey.

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>es (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that strategies that promote student interactions and cognitively engage students with content (<i>1</i>) lead to gains in learning and attitudinal outcomes for students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Many educational and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>mental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>).

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Improving refugee integration through data-driven algorithmic assignment
<p>Developed democracies are settling an increased number of refugees, many of whom face challenges integrating into host societies. We developed a flexible data-driven algorithm that assigns refugees across resettlement locations to improve integration outcomes. The algorithm uses a combi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> of supervised machine learning and optimal matching to discover and leverage synergies between refugee characteristics and resettlement sites. The algorithm was tested on historical registry data from two countries with different assignment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>es and refugee populations, the United States and Switzerland. Our approach led to gains of roughly 40 to 70%, on average, in refugees’ employment outcomes relative to current assignment practices. This approach can provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ments with a practical and cost-efficient policy tool that can be immediately implemented within existing institutional structures.</p>

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory
<p>In common with many strongly correlated electron systems, intermediate valence compounds are believed to display a crossover from a high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e of incoherently fluctuating local moments to a low-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e of coherent hybridized bands. We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-electron bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-electron coherence.</p>

How the news media activate public expression and influence national agendas
<p>We demonstrate that exposure to the news media causes Americans to take public stands on specific issues, join <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al policy conversations, and express themselves publicly—all key components of democratic politics—more often than they would otherwise. After recruiting 48 mostly small media outlets, we chose groups of these outlets to write and publish articles on subjects we approved, on dates we randomly assigned. We estimated the causal effect on proximal measures, such as website pageviews and Twitter discussion of the articles’ specific subjects, and distal ones, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Twitter conversation in broad policy areas. Our intervention increased discussion in each broad policy area by ~62.7% (relative to a day’s volume), accounting for 13,166 additional posts over the treatment week, with similar effects across population subgroups.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries
<p>Resonant cavities are essential building blocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing many wave-based phenomena, but their geometry and reciprocity fundamentally limit the integration of optical devices. We report, at telecommunication wavelengths, geometry-independent and integrated nonreciprocal topological cavities that couple stimulated emission from one-way photonic edge states to a selected waveguide output with an isolation ratio in excess of 10 decibels. Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants. Our experimental demonstration of lasing from topological cavities provides the opportunity to develop complex topological circuitry of arbitrary geometries for the integrated and robust generation and transport of photons in classical and quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>es.</p>

NIH quietly shelves gun research program
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) wasn't coy when it responded to a call from then-President Barack Obama for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ment agencies to do firearm research. The president's plea came on the heels of a gunman's murder of 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012. Nine months later, the huge biomedical research agency issued three notices encouraging scientists to apply to do research on violence and its prevention, particularly firearm research. NIH has since spent $18 million funding 22 projects. But the agency has now let the gun research program lapse, <i>Science</i> has learned. It stopped taking applications in January, despite a written plea from a score of scientists, and the last new awards are now being launched. Last week, an agency spokesperson said that renewal of the program "is still under consideration," but gave no timeline for when the agency would reach a decision.</p>

A prominent glycyl radical enzyme in human gut microbiomes metabolizes <i>trans</i>-4-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-proline
<p>The human microbiome encodes vast numbers of uncharacterized enzymes, limiting our functional understanding of this community and its effects on host health and disease. By incorporating information about enzymatic chemistry into quantitative metagenomics, we determined the abundance and distribution of individual members of the glycyl radical enzyme superfamily among the microbiomes of healthy humans. We identified many uncharacterized family members, including a universally distributed enzyme that enables commensal gut microbes and human pathogens to dehydrate <i>trans</i>-4-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-proline, the product of the most abundant human posttranslational modification. This “chemically guided functional profiling” workflow can therefore use ecological context to facilitate the discovery of enzymes in microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es.</p>

Transverse Demagnetization Dynamics of a Unitary Fermi Gas
<sec><title>Untwisting the Spin Spiral</title><p>Ultracold Fermi gases in the so-called unitary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e—where the diverging interactions between atoms make their thermodynamics universal—are an excellent test bed for an array of strongly interacting matter systems.

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>es. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>es. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>e, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regim</span></strong>es.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Cytosolic DNA Sensing Promotes Macrophage Transformation and Governs Myocardial Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardium irreversibly injured by ischemic stress must be efficiently repaired to maintain tissue integrity and contractile performance. Macrophages play critical roles in this process. These cells transform across a spectrum of phenotypes to accomplish diverse functions ranging from mediating the initial inflammatory responses that clear damaged tissue to subsequent reparative functions that help rebuild replacement tissue. Although macrophage transformation is crucial to myocardial repair, events <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing this transformation are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we set out to determine whether innate immune responses triggered by cytoplasmic DNA play a role.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report that ischemic myocardial injury, along with the resulting release of nucleic acids, activates the recently described cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Animals lacking cyclic GMP-AMP synthase display significantly improved early survival after myocardial infarction and diminished pathological remodeling, including ventricular rupture, enhanced angiogenesis, and preserved ventricular contractile function. Furthermore, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase loss of function abolishes the induction of key inflammatory programs such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes the transformation of macrophages to a reparative phenotype, which results in enhanced repair and improved hemodynamic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal, for the first time, that the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase functions during cardiac ischemia as a pattern recognition receptor in the sterile immune response. Furthermore, we report that this pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>s macrophage transformation, thereby regulating postinjury cardiac repair. Because modulators of this pathway are currently in clinical use, our findings raise the prospect of new treatment options to combat ischemic heart disease and its progression to heart failure.</p></sec>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health and Nutrition Exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables.

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05).

Genetic Predisposition, Clinical Risk Factor Burden, and Lifetime Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term probability of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) considering genetic predisposition and clinical risk factor burden is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the lifetime risk of AF in individuals from the community-based Framingham Heart Study. Polygenic risk for AF was derived using a score of ≈1000 AF-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Clinical risk factor burden was calculated for each individual using a validated risk score for incident AF comprised of height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking status, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of heart failure. We estimated the lifetime risk of AF within tertiles of polygenic and clinical risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 4606 participants without AF at 55 years of age, 580 developed incident AF (median follow-up, 9.4 years; 25th–75th percentile, 4.4–14.3 years). The lifetime risk of AF >55 years of age was 37.1% and was substantially influenced by both polygenic and clinical risk factor burden. Among individuals free of AF at 55 years of age, those in low-polygenic and clinical risk tertiles had a lifetime risk of AF of 22.3% (95% confidence interval, 15.4−9.1), whereas those in high-risk tertiles had a risk of 48.2% (95% confidence interval, 41.3−55.1). A lower clinical risk factor burden was associated with later AF onset after adjusting for genetic predisposition (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In our community-based cohort, the lifetime risk of AF was 37%. Estimation of polygenic AF risk is feasible and together with clinical risk factor burden explains a substantial gradient in long-term AF risk.</p></sec>

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure remains significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term survival is not well understood. We hypothesized that an optimal interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P survival exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set was used. Transplant-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The risk-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors. In patients with multiple risk factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the optimal timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few risk factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS. Early S2P did not rescue patients with greater risk factor burdens. Instead, referral for heart transplantation may offer their best chance at long-term survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prolonged, Uninterrupted Sedentary Behavior and Glycemic Biomarkers Among US Hispanic/Latino Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>s and is associated with deleterious health outcomes. Few studies have examined whether the manner in which sedentary time is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries any clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior with glycemic biomarkers in a cohort of US Hispanic/Latino adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 12 083 participants from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos), a population-based study of Hispanic/Latino adults 18 to 74 years of age. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured from a fasting blood sample, and 2-hour glucose was measured after an oral glucose tolerance test. Sedentary time was objectively measured with a hip-mounted accelerometer. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjustment for potential confounders and moderate to vigorous physical activity, longer sedentary bout duration was dose-dependently associated with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001) and 2-hour glucose levels (<i>P</i> for trend=0.015). These associations were not independent of total sedentary time; however, a significant interaction between sedentary bout duration and total sedentary time was observed. Evaluation of the joint association of total sedentary time and sedentary bout duration showed that participants in the upper quartile for both sedentary characteristics (ie, high total sedentary time and high sedentary bout duration) had the highest levels of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i><0.001 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics) and 2-hour glucose (<i>P</i>=0.002 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics). High total sedentary time or high sedentary bout duration alone were not associated with differences in any glycemic biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Accruing sedentary time in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts may be deleteriously associated with biomarkers of glucose regulation.</p></sec>

Our goal was to evaluate the degree of agreement of electronic data research networks in comparison with data collected by standardized research approaches in a cohort study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked individual-level data from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a community-based cohort, with HealthLNK, a 2006 to 2012 database of electronic health records from 6 Chicago health systems. To evaluate the correlation and agreement of blood pressure in HealthLNK in comparison with in-person MESA exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>s, and body mass index in HealthLNK in comparison with MESA, we used Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots.

We also identified potential myocardial infarctions, strokes, and heart failure events in HealthLNK and compared them with adjudicated events in MESA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 1164 MESA participants enrolled at the Chicago Field Center, 802 (68.9%) participants had data in HealthLNK. The correlation was low for systolic blood pressure (0.39; <i>P</i><0.0001). In comparison with MESA, HealthLNK overestimated systolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 4.2–7.8). There was a high correlation between body mass index in MESA and HealthLNK (0.94; <i>P</i><0.0001). HealthLNK underestimated body mass index by 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval, –0.4 to –0.1). With the use of <i>Inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data, the sensitivity and specificity of HealthLNK queries for hypertension were 82.4% and 59.4%, for obesity were 73.0% and 89.8%, and for diabetes mellitus were 79.8% and 93.3%. In comparison with adjudicated cardiovascular events in MESA, the concordance rates for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure were, respectively, 41.7% (5/12), 61.5% (8/13), and 62.5% (10/16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings illustrate the limitations and strengths of electronic data repositories in comparison with information collected by traditional standardized epidemiological approaches for the ascertainment of cardiovascular risk factors and events.</p></sec>

However, little is known about the current prevalence, incidence, and mortality of stroke at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al level, and the trend in the past 30 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 2013, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>ally representative door-to-door survey was conducted in 155 urban and rural centers in 31 provinces in China, totaling 480 687 adults aged ≥20 years. All stroke survivors were considered as prevalent stroke cases at the prevalent time (August 31, 2013). First-ever strokes that occurred during 1 year preceding the survey point-prevalent time were considered as incident cases. According to computed tomography/MRI/autopsy findings, strokes were categorized into ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke of undetermined type.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 480 687 participants, 7672 were diagnosed with a prevalent stroke (1596.0/100 000 people) and 1643 with incident strokes (345.1/100 000 person-years). The age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates were 1114.8/100 000 people, 246.8 and 114.8/100 000 person-years, respectively. Pathological type of stroke was documented by computed tomography/MRI brain scanning in 90% of prevalent and 83% of incident stroke cases. Among incident and prevalent strokes, ischemic stroke constituted 69.6% and 77.8%, intracerebral hemorrhage 23.8% and 15.8%, subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.4% and 4.4%, and undetermined type 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Age-specific stroke prevalence in men aged ≥40 years was significantly greater than the prevalence in women (<i>P</i><0.001). The most prevalent risk factors among stroke survivors were hypertension (88%), smoking (48%), and alcohol use (44%). Stroke prevalence estimates in 2013 were statistically greater than those reported in China 3 decades ago, especially among rural residents (<i>P</i>=0.017). The highest annual incidence and mortality of stroke was in Northeast (365 and 159/100 000 person-years), then Central areas (326 and 154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest incidence was in Southwest China (154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest mortality was in South China (65/100 000 person-years) (<i>P</i><0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Stroke burden in China has increased over the past 30 years, and remains particularly high in rural areas. There is a north-to-south gradient in stroke in China, with the greatest stroke burden observed in the northern and central regions.</p></sec>

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Health and Nutrition Exami<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> Survey and linked with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year.

Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-effective. AP was even more cost-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk. These findings support the cost-effectiveness of guidelines recommending AP use in high-risk individuals.</p></sec>

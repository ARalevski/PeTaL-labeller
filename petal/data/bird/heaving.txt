Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position measurement alters the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of an object being measured. This quantum measurement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we measure the beam’s thermally driven vibrations and perturb its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> with optical force fluctuations at a level dictated by the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance uncertainty relation. We demonstrate a cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> from thermally driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is determined by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

A valley valve and electron beam splitter
<p>Developing alternative paradigms of electronics beyond silicon technology requires the exploration of fundamentally new physical mechanisms, such as the valley-specific phenomena in hexagonal two-dimensional materials. We realize ballistic valley Hall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> states in bilayer graphene and demonstrate gate-controlled current transmission in a four-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> router device. The operations of a waveguide, a valve, and a tunable electron beam splitter are demonstrated. The valley valve exploits the valley-momentum locking of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> states and reaches an on/off ratio of 8 at zero magnetic field. A magnetic field enables a full-range tunable coherent beam splitter. These results pave a path to building a scalable, coherent quantum transportation network based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong> states.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are learned through trial and error by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ed auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ed syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ion probability. Thus, dopaminergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learned for reward and are instead learned by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, with particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Variation in functional pelvic tilt in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pelvis rotates in the sagittal plane during daily activities.   These rotations have a direct effect on the functional orientation   of the acetabulum.

Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, over the branches of this fixed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to estimates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for each family is unresolved.

Dynamic response and hydrodynamics of polarized crowds
<p>Modeling crowd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> is central to situations as diverse as risk prevention in mass events and visual effects rendering in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> picture industry. The difficulty of performing quantitative measurements in model experiments has limited our ability to model pedestrian flows. We use tens of thousands of road-race participants in starting corrals to elucidate the flowing behavior of polarized crowds by probing its response to boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>. We establish that speed information propagates over system-spanning scales through polarized crowds, whereas orientational fluctuations are locally suppressed. Building on these observations, we lay out a hydrodynamic theory of polarized crowds and demonstrate its predictive power. We expect this description of human groups as active continua to provide quantitative guidelines for crowd management.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode corrosion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most corrosion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit corrosion by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in corrosion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Asymmetric distribution and spatial switching of dynein activity generates ciliary motility
<p>Motile cilia and flagella are essential, highly conserved organelles, and their motility is driven by the coordinated activities of multiple dynein isoforms. The prevailing “switch-point” hypothesis posits that dyneins are asymmetrically activated to drive flagellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing. To test this model, we applied cryo–electron tomography to visualize activity states of individual dyneins relative to their locations along beating flagella of sea urchin sperm cells. As predicted, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing was generated by the asymmetric distribution of dynein activity on opposite sides of the flagellum. However, contrary to predictions, most dyneins were in their active state, and the smaller population of conformationally inactive dyneins switched flagellar sides relative to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing direction. Thus, our data suggest a “switch-inhibition” mechanism in which force imbalance is generated by inhibiting, rather than activating, dyneins on alternating sides of the flagellum.</p>

Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks
<p>Subcellular membraneless assemblies are a reinvigorated area of study in biology, with spirited scientific discussions on the forces between the low-complexity protein domains within these assemblies. To illuminate these forces, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless assemblies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong>ed β sheets that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong>ed sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kink</span></strong>ed structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless assemblies.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong> angle of the flagellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong> angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Detecting nanometric displacements with optical ruler metrology
<p>We introduce the optical ruler, an electromagnetic analog of a physical ruler, for nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement metrology. The optical ruler is a complex electromagnetic field in which singularities serve as the marks on the scale. It is created by the diffraction of light on a metasurface, with singularity marks then revealed by high-magnification interferometric observation. Using a Pancharatnam-Berry phase metasurface, we demonstrate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement resolving power of better than 1 nanometer (λ/800, where λ is the wavelength of light) at a wavelength of 800 nanometers. We argue that a resolving power of ~λ/4000, the typical size of an atom, may be achievable. An optical ruler with dimensions of only a few tens of micrometers offers applications in nanometrology, nanomonitoring, and nanofabrication, particularly in the demanding and confined environment of future smart manufacturing tools.</p>

The entorhinal cognitive map is attracted to goals
<p>Grid cells with their rigid hexagonal firing fields are thought to provide an invariant metric to the hippocampal cognitive map, yet environmental geometrical features have recently been shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong> the grid structure. Given that the hippocampal role goes beyond space, we tested the influence of nonspatial information on the grid organization.

Many grid fields moved toward goal location, leading to long-lasting deformations of the entorhinal map. Therefore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ions in the grid structure contribute to goal representation during both learning and recall, which demonstrates that grid cells participate in mnemonic coding and do not merely provide a simple metric of space.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural transformations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid transformation) with first order (isomerization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid transformations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal
<p>Design of the gas-diffusion process in a porous material is challenging because a contracted pore aperture is a prerequisite, whereas the channel traffic of guest molecules is regulated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ible and dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s of nanochannels. Here, we present the rational design of a diffusion-regulatory system in a porous coordination polymer (PCP) in which flip-flop molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s within the framework structure provide kinetic gate functions that enable efficient gas separation and storage. The PCP shows substantial temperature-responsive adsorption in which the adsorbate molecules are differentiated by each gate-admission temperature, facilitating kinetics-based gas separations of oxygen/argon and ethylene/ethane with high selectivities of ~350 and ~75, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the long-lasting physical encapsulation of ethylene at ambient conditions, owing to strongly impeded diffusion in distinctive nanochannels.</p>

Directional control of a processive molecular hopper
<p>Intrigued by the potential of nanoscale machines, scientists have long attempted to control molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>. We monitored the individual 0.7-nanometer steps of a single molecular hopper as it moved in an electric field along a track in a nanopore controlled by a chemical ratchet. The hopper demonstrated characteristics desired in a moving molecule: defined start and end points, processivity, no chemical fuel requirement, directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, and external control. The hopper was readily functionalized to carry cargos. For example, a DNA molecule could be ratcheted along the track in either direction, a prerequisite for nanopore sequencing.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The explosive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that magnetic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the magnetic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of paramagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonparamagnetic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by magnetic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and magnetism.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The structural mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The structures reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s and convert these pistonlike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s into helical rotations. Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can open and close, and it has been assumed that the open RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA melting. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the open RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s control the promoter search and drive DNA melting in the absence of external energy sources.</p>

Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics

Lateral electrochemical undergrowth of a sacrificial SiO<i><sub>x</sub></i> layer was achieved by photoelectrochemically oxidizing silicon under light irradiation. A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet resistance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in resistance after 4000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing cycles. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ible organic light-emitting diode based on tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) that was spin-coated on a foil exploited the transmittance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ibility of the gold foil.

Distortion of histone octamer core promotes nucleosome mobilization by a chromatin remodeler
<p>Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential biological roles by mobilizing nucleosomal DNA. Yet, how DNA is mobilized despite the steric constraints placed by the histone octamer remains unknown. Using methyl transverse relaxation–optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 450-kilodalton complex, we show that the chromatin remodeler, SNF2h, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>s the histone octamer. Binding of SNF2h in an activated ATP state changes the dynamics of buried histone residues. Preventing octamer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ion by site-specific disulfide linkages inhibits nucleosome sliding by SNF2h while promoting octamer eviction by the SWI-SNF complex, RSC. Our findings indicate that the histone core of a nucleosome is more plastic than previously imagined and that octamer deformation plays different roles based on the type of chromatin remodeler. Octamer plasticity may contribute to chromatin regulation beyond ATP-dependent remodeling.</p>

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns
<p>Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong> but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong> regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges.

Structural basis for the gating mechanism of the type 2 ryanodine receptor RyR2

Structural comparison reveals a breathing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the overall cytoplasmic region resulted from the interdomain movements of amino-terminal domains (NTDs), Helical domains, and Handle domains, whereas almost no intradomain shifts are observed in these armadillo repeats–containing domains.

Molecular force spectroscopy with a DNA origami–based nanoscopic force clamp
<p>Forces in biological systems are typically investigated at the single-molecule level with atomic force microscopy or optical and magnetic tweezers, but these techniques suffer from limited data throughput and their requirement for a physical connection to the macroscopic world. We introduce a self-assembled nanoscopic force clamp built from DNA that operates autonomously and allows massive parallelization. Single-stranded DNA sections of an origami structure acted as entropic springs and exerted controlled tension in the low piconewton range on a molecular system, whose conformational transitions were monitored by single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. We used the conformer switching of a Holliday junction as a benchmark and studied the TATA-binding protein–induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing of a DNA duplex under tension. The observed suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing above 10 piconewtons provides further evidence of mechanosensitivity in gene regulation.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>ing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong> propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and animals, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and correlated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not animals. The correlation of sequence and structural data suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> by mouth suction.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic force; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic force. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of force created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic force was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>s out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bend</span></strong>s into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the force in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous force in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

The objective of this study was to   test this hypothesis with propriety hydroxyapatite, peri-apatite,   coated tibial components using component migration measured with radiostereometric   analysis over two years as an indicator of long-term fixation.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients at two centres received uncemented PA-coated   tibial components and were followed for two years with radiostereometric   analysis exams to quantify the migration of the component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>While there was significant variation in individual migration   patterns, the overall migration of the tibial component in the study   group demonstrated a pattern of initial migration followed by stabilisation   after one year, with mean maximum total point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> (MTPM) of 0.02   mm (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 0.20) between one and two years   post-operatively.

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distort</span></strong>ion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

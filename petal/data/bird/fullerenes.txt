Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> and helium isotopes from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> isotope composition of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. The fractional burial of organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> is lower than traditionally determined from a global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> isotope mass balance and may have varied over geological time, modulated by supercontinent formation and breakup.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p>Soil is the largest terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sink by 2100, yet the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide dynamics.</p>

A Nanoparticle-Based Combination Chemotherapy Delivery System for Enhanced Tumor Killing by Dynamic Rewiring of Signaling Pathways
<sec><title>Timing the One-Two Punch</title><p>Morton <i>et al</i>. developed a dual-drug, time-delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e delivery system for treating cancer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es contained two drugs (one in the membrane and one in the center) and were coated to target the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es to cancer cells. Cancer cells took up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es. The first drug quickly escaped the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e, sensitizing the cells to the second drug, which escaped more slowly. In mice, tumors from cells that respond to the first drug were reduced when the mice were treated with the dual-drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es, but the tumors continued to grow in mice receiving only single-drug therapy. This time-delayed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e-mediated drug delivery may avoid the resistance that cancer cells develop to chemotherapy.</p></sec>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that soil warming results in a four-phase pattern of soil organic matter decay and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>s lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient metabolism alongside the fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño
<p>The 2015–2016 El Niñño led to historically high temperatures and low precipitation over the tropics, while the growth rate of atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was the largest on record. Here we quantify the response of tropical net biosphere exchange, gross primary production, biomass burning, and respiration to these climate anomalies by assimilating column CO<sub>2</sub>, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide observations from multiple satellites. Relative to the 2011 La Niññña, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 ± 0.34 gigatons more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into the atmosphere in 2015, consisting of approximately even contributions from three tropical continents but dominated by diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> exchange processes. The heterogeneity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-exchange processes indicated here challenges previous studies that suggested that a single dominant process determines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle interannual variability.</p>

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world’s tropical forests are a net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> source of 425.2<bold> </bold>± 92.0 teragrams of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> per year (Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). This net release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> consists of losses of 861.7 ± 80.2 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup> and gains of 436.5 ± 31.0 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>. Gains result from forest growth; losses result from deforestation and from reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> density within standing forests (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses.</p>

Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the device research community to reduce the transistor footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel transistor scaled to such an extremely small dimension. Built on one semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon technologies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show transistors with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon devices under the same overdrive, without any normalization. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e source, and self-assembly to pack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Quantitative 3D evolution of colloidal nanoparticle oxidation in solution

Faster Decomposition Under Increased Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Limits Soil Carbon Storage

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e layer, resulting in a moiré superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus-obtained twisted bilayer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e (TBG). We studied the propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway for controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e and other atomically layered van der Waals materials, eliminating the need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.</p>

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bond-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-sulfur (C–S) bond in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> (Fe–C) bond between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM enzymes reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> of the SAM C–S bond being cleaved is positioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster. Our results explain how selective C–S bond cleavage is achieved in this radical SAM enzyme.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transition metal is not required, and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> centers.</p>

Carbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Photosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation mechanisms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green alga that can grow using various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative mechanisms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability.</p>

<p>The synthesis of ultrasmall supported bimetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es (between 1 and 3 nanometers in diameter) with well-defined stoichiometry and intimacy between constituent metals remains a substantial challenge. We synthesized 10 different supported bimetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es via surface inorganometallic chemistry by decomposing and reducing surface-adsorbed heterometallic double complex salts, which are readily obtained upon sequential adsorption of target cations and anions on a silica substrate. For example, adsorption of tetraamminepalladium(II) [Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup>] followed by adsorption of tetrachloroplatinate [PtCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] was used to form palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es. These supported bimetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es show enhanced catalytic performance in acetylene selective hydrogenation, which clearly demonstrates a synergistic effect between constituent metals.</p>

Entropy-driven stability of chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes
<p>Single-walled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es are hollow cylinders that can grow centimeters long via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> incorporation at the interface with a catalyst. They display semiconducting or metallic characteristics, depending on their helicity, which is determined during their growth. To support the quest for a selective synthesis, we develop a thermodynamic model that relates the tube-catalyst interfacial energies, temperature, and the resulting tube chirality. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es can grow chiral because of the configurational entropy of their nanometer-sized edge, thus explaining experimentally observed temperature evolutions of chiral distributions. Taking the chemical nature of the catalyst into account through interfacial energies, we derive structural maps and phase diagrams that will guide a rational choice of a catalyst and growth parameters toward a better selectivity.</p>

Interrupted carbonyl-olefin metathesis via oxygen atom transfer

Synthesis of ultrasmall, homogeneously alloyed, bimetallic nanoparticles on silica supports
<p>Supported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es containing more than one metal have a variety of applications in sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. Common synthesis techniques for this type of material often result in large, unalloyed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es that lack the interactions between the two metals that give the particles their desired characteristics. We demonstrate a relatively simple, effective, generalizable method to produce highly dispersed, well-alloyed bimetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es. Ten permutations of noble and base metals (platinum, palladium, copper, nickel, and cobalt) were synthesized with average particle sizes from 0.9 to 1.4 nanometers, with tight size distributions.

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean’s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite oxidation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite oxidation may have a greater impact on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle than previously assumed.</p>

Tunable porous nanoallotropes prepared by post-assembly etching of binary nanoparticle superlattices
<p>Self-assembly of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>es has been used to prepare hundreds of different colloidal crystals, but almost invariably with the restriction that the particles must be densely packed. Here, we show that non–close-packed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e arrays can be fabricated through the selective removal of one of two components comprising binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanoparticl</span></strong>e superlattices.

Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the particular role of the liquid in templating the formation of superlattices not achievable through self-assembly in bulk solution. Second, upon stabilization, all of these binary superlattices could be transformed into distinct “nanoallotropes”—nanoporous materials having the same chemical composition but differing in their nanoscale architectures.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide plus water yields dihydrogen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations. This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low working temperature. Potential application in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the working temperature of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units. We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS reaction. Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low temperatures.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses.

The HHG in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate secretion by the intestine generates luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Reversibility of citrate synthase allows autotrophic growth of a thermophilic bacterium

Here we show that the sulfur-reducing anaerobic deltaproteobacterium <i>Desulfurella acetivorans</i> is capable of both acetate oxidation and autotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation, with the tricarboxylic acid cycle operating either in the oxidative or reductive direction, respectively. Under autotrophic conditions, the enzyme citrate synthase cleaves citrate adenosine triphosphate independently into acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate, a reaction that has been regarded as impossible under physiological conditions. Because this overlooked, energetically efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation pathway lacks key enzymes, it may function unnoticed in many organisms, making bioinformatical predictions difficult, if not impossible.</p>

These regio- and diastereoselective processes enable convergent construction of type II polyketide substructures.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and constructed from all sp<sup>2</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>s by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a paramagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> structure with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> framework induces ferromagnetic phase transition to develop spin-spin coherence and align spins unidirectionally across the material.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase. Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e device applications.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing ion diffusion limitations in thicker electrodes. We report the design of a three-dimensional (3D) holey-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e/niobia (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass loading (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid ion transport. By systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applications.</p>

Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt
<p>The synthesis of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> nanobelt, comprising a closed loop of fully fused edge-sharing benzene rings, has been an elusive goal in organic chemistry for more than 60 years. Here we report the synthesis of one such compound through iterative Wittig reactions followed by a nickel-mediated aryl-aryl coupling reaction. The cylindrical shape of its belt structure was confirmed by x-ray crystallography, and its fundamental optoelectronic properties were elucidated by ultraviolet-visible absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopic studies, as well as theoretical calculations. This molecule could potentially serve as a seed for the preparation of structurally well-defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming
<p>Soil organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> harbors three times as much <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> as Earth’s atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral soil, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all soil depths increased with 4°C warming; annual soil respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface soil) and models.</p>

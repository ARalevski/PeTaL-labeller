The image-forming mirror in the eye of the scallop
<p>Scallops possess a visual system comprising up to 200 eyes, each containing a concave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong> rather than a lens to focus light. The hierarchical organization of the multilayered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong> is controlled for image formation, from the component guanine crystals at the nanoscale to the complex three-dimensional morphology at the millimeter level. The layered structure of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong> is tuned to reflect the wavelengths of light penetrating the scallop’s habitat and is tiled with a mosaic of square guanine crystals, which reduces optical aberrations. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong> forms images on a double-layered retina used for separately imaging the peripheral and central fields of view. The tiled, off-axis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong> of the scallop eye bears a striking resemblance to the segmented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>s of reflecting telescopes.</p>

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical surfaces as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong> properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the surface. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical surfaces as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with acoustic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong> properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

Widespread control of calcium signaling by a family of SERCA-inhibiting micropeptides
<p>Micropeptides function as master regulators of calcium-dependent signaling in muscle. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA), the membrane pump that promotes muscle relaxation by taking up Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is directly inhibited by three muscle-specific micropeptides: myoregulin (MLN), phospholamban (PLN), and sarcolipin (SLN). The widespread and essential function of SERCA across diverse cell types has raised questions as to how SERCA is regulated in cells that lack MLN, PLN, and SLN. We identified two transmembrane micropeptides, endoregulin (ELN) and another-regulin (ALN), that share key amino acids with their muscle-specific counterparts and function as direct inhibitors of SERCA pump activity. The distribution of transcripts encoding ELN and ALN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ed that of SERCA isoform-encoding transcripts in nonmuscle cell types. Our findings identify additional members of the SERCA-inhibitory micropeptide family, revealing a conserved mechanism for the control of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in both muscle and nonmuscle cell types.</p>

Oncogenic RAS isoforms show a hierarchical requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS2 to mediate cell transformation
<p>About a third of tumors have activating mutations in <i>HRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, or <i>KRAS</i>, genes encoding guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS family. In these tumors, wild-type RAS cooperates with mutant RAS to promote downstream effector activation and cell proliferation and transformation, suggesting that upstream activators of wild-type RAS are important modulators of mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 mediates KRAS-driven proliferation, but little is understood about the role of SOS2. We found that RAS family members have a hierarchical requirement for the expression and activity of SOS2 to drive cellular transformation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, transformation. <i>Sos2</i> deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent activation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular transformation that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ed the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven transformation required the GEF activity of SOS2 and was restored in <i>Sos2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> MEFs by expression of constitutively activated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>SOS2</i> reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the transformed phenotype of human <i>KRAS</i> mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven transformation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.</p>

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator

There exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal symmetries, captured by the 17 “wallpaper groups.” Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described topological crystalline insulators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a topological insulating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem.

Supporting recovery from brain injury
<p>The beauty and intricacy of the human brain is unfortunately also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ed by its vulnerability. Damage to the brain is typically permanent. Because cells of the adult brain, apart from rare exceptions, no longer divide, there is essentially no regrowth of damaged brain tissue. Acquired brain injury in the majority of cases occurs directly through traumatic events such as an accident involving a blow to the head or indirectly through interruption of the blood supply, namely a stroke. Brain injury is a major burden, with an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffering a traumatic brain injury and nearly 800,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, current treatment options for such brain injuries are still limited and are focused on the first hours after the insult. On page 50 of this issue, Abe <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a new approach in mouse and primate models that aims to enhance the ability of the brain to regain functionality in the days and weeks after brain injury.</p>

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas
<p>Subwavelength, high–refractive index semiconductor nanostructures support optical resonances that endow them with valuable antenna functions. Control over the intrinsic properties, including their complex refractive index, size, and geometry, has been used to manipulate fundamental light absorption, scattering, and emission processes in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. In this study, we harness the electric and magnetic resonances of such antennas to achieve a very strong dependence of the optical properties on the external environment. Specifically, we illustrate how the resonant scattering wavelength of single silicon nanowires is tunable across the entire visible spectrum by simply moving the height of the nanowires above a metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>. We apply this concept by using a nanoelectromechanical platform to demonstrate active tuning.</p>

A genetic signature of the evolution of loss of flight in the Galapagos cormorant

We studied wing and pectoral skeleton reduction leading to flightlessness in the Galapagos cormorant (<i>Phalacrocorax harrisi</i>). We sequenced and de novo assembled the genomes of four cormorant species and applied a predictive and comparative genomics approach to find candidate variants that may have contributed to the evolution of flightlessness. These analyses and cross-species experiments in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and in chondrogenic cell lines implicated variants in genes necessary for transcriptional regulation and function of the primary cilium.

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited genomic resources. We used comparative chromosome painting to identify the extent of chromosomal collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid genomes (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress genomes originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) genome, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation chromosomes (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal chromosome translocation in watercress, both genomes are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental subgenomes might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress genomes. The subgenome stasis, apart from the single-chromosome translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid genomes. The octoploid genome of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ing the tetraploid horseradish and watercress genomes, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cytogenomic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-genome sequencing efforts and genetic improvement of both crop species.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem transport and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin glucoside, is recognized by Suc transporters, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal tool for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal tool for in vivo studies of phloem transport. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the velocity of phloem transport. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem velocity rapidly, supporting the pressure-flow model of phloem transport. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem velocity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ed changes in the expression of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem transport velocity.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ed by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

Chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluxes into and across Thylakoids Revealed by Thylakoid-Targeted Aequorin Probes
<p>Chloroplasts require a fine-tuned control of their internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is crucial for many aspects of photosynthesis and for other chloroplast-localized processes. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium regulation within chloroplasts also may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in the cytosol. To investigate the involvement of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and in the modulation of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, we targeted the bioluminescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin as a YFP fusion to the lumen and the stromal surface of thylakoids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the dark, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid lumen were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different intrachloroplast subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid lumen) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique kinetic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid lumen. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ing transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for dark-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-dark-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside chloroplasts. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within chloroplasts and plant cells.</p>

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Phosphate starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type phosphatases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the induction of molecular markers related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>s the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the phosphate starvation response.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Contribution of neural cell death to depressive phenotypes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice
<p>Major depression disorder (MDD) or depression is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetes, and the depressive symptoms are more severe and less responsive to antidepressant therapies in these patients. The underlying mechanism is little understood. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of comorbid depression was more complex than that proposed for MDD and that neural cell death played a role in the disease severity. To test this hypothesis, we generated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. These mice had blood glucose levels threefold above controls and exhibited depressive phenotypes as judged by a battery of behavioral tests, thus confirming the comorbidity in mice. Immunohistological studies showed markedly increased TUNEL-positive cells in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the comorbid mice, indicating apoptosis. This finding was supported by increased caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 proteins in these brain regions. In addition, the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level of comorbid mice was reduced compared with controls, further supporting the neurodegenerative change. Mechanistic analyses showed an increased expression of mitochondrial fission genes fission protein 1 (<i>Fis1</i>) and dynamin-related protein 1 (<i>Drp1</i>), and a decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion genes mitofusin 1 (<i>Mfn1</i>), mitofusin 2 (<i>Mfn2</i>) and optical atrophy 1 (<i>Opa1</i>). Representative assessment of the proteins Drp1 and Mfn2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mirror</span></strong>ed the mRNA changes. The data demonstrated that neural cell death was associated with the depressive phenotype of comorbid mice and that a fission-dominant expression of genes and proteins mediating mitochondrial dynamics played a role in the hyperglycemia-induced cell death. The study provides new insight into the disease mechanism and could aid the development of novel therapeutics aimed at providing neuroprotection by modulating mitochondrial dynamics to treat comorbid depression with diabetes.</p>

These beneficial effects of lovastatin in mice were abrogated by in vivo miR-133a overexpression or GCH1 knockdown.

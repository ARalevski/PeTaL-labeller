An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in ORGANELLE RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing interacting protein/multiple organellar RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic pentatricopeptide repeat protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>osomes. While some plastid RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing, like the essential site-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that plastid RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ed forms of plastid genes.</p>

‘CAMERA’ records cell action with new CRISPR tricks
<p>Biologists long have devised ways to track the inner working of cells, tagging genes with fluorescent proteins and the like to better understand diseases, embryology, and environmental impacts. With the advent of CRISPR, best known as a genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing tool, many groups have tried to fashion novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing devices. In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that float around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er one to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which works in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>or to alter the DNA in a "safe harbor" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe harbor gene's sequence can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed region were required for <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

The RNA Editing Factor SlORRM4 Is Required for Normal Fruit Ripening in Tomato
<p>RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing plays a key posttranscriptional role in gene expression. Existing studies on cytidine-to-uridine RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing in plants have focused on maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the importance and regulation of RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing in several critical agronomic processes are not well understood, a notable example of which is fruit ripening. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of 33 RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing factors and identified 11 putative tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit ripening-related factors. A rapid virus-induced gene silencing assay indicated that the organelle RNA recognition motif-containing protein SlORRM4 affected tomato fruit ripening. Knocking out SlORRM4 expression using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing strategy delayed tomato fruit ripening by lowering respiratory rate and ethylene production. Additionally, the expression of numerous genes associated with fruit ripening and mitochondrial functions changed significantly when <i>SlORRM4</i> was knocked out. Moreover, the loss of <i>SlORRM4</i> function significantly reduced RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing of many mitochondrial transcripts, leading to low-level expression of some core subunits that are critical for mitochondrial complex assembly (i.e. Nad3, Cytc1, and COX II). Taken together, these results indicate that SlORRM4 is involved in RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing of transcripts in ripening fruit that influence mitochondrial function and key aspects of fruit ripening.</p>

Opposing Actions of Fibroblast and Cardiomyocyte Smad3 Signaling in the Infarcted Myocardium

The effects of cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smad-independent actions in isolated cardiac fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mice with fibroblast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused infarction and exhibited an increased incidence of late rupture after nonreperfused infarction.

Polarized light microscopy in Sirius red–stained sections demonstrated that the changes in fibroblast morphology were associated with perturbed organization of the collagenous matrix in the infarcted area. In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin expression by infarct myofibroblasts was not affected by Smad3 loss. Smad3 critically regulated fibroblast function, activating integrin-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase–2 (NOX-2) expression. Smad3 loss in cardiomyocytes attenuated remodeling and dysfunction after infarction.

Cytosine base editor generates substantial off-target single-nucleotide variants in mouse embryos

However, it is difficult to determine off-target effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing due to single-nucleotide polymorphism in individuals.

Control of Cognate Sense mRNA Translation by cis-Natural Antisense RNAs
<p>Cis-Natural Antisense Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding genes and are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, constitute an important group of noncoding RNAs. Whereas several examples of cis-NATs regulating the expression of their cognate sense gene are known, most cis-NATs function by altering the steady-state level or structure of mRNA via changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or splicing, and very few cases involve the regulation of sense mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion. This study was designed to systematically search for cis-NATs influencing cognate sense mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Establishment of a pipeline relying on sequencing of total polyA<sup>+</sup> and polysomal RNA from Arabidopsis grown under various conditions (i.e. nutrient deprivation and phytohormone treatments) allowed the identification of 14 cis-NATs whose expression correlated either positively or negatively with cognate sense mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion. With use of a combination of cis-NAT stable over-expression in transgenic plants and transient expression in protoplasts, the impact of cis-NAT expression on mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion was confirmed for 4 out of 5 tested cis-NAT:sense mRNA pairs. These results expand the number of cis-NATs known to regulate cognate sense mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion and provide a foundation for future studies of their mode of action. Moreover, this study highlights the role of this class of noncoding RNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion regulation.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or decay. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are released from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion recovery and SG dissociation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were released and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these released mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient release of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil.

Design and evaluation of engineered protein biosensors for live-cell imaging of EGFR phosphorylation
<p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy is broadly applied to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell signaling, but the availability of intracellular biosensors is limited. A biosensor based on the tandem SH2 domains from phospholipase C–γ1 (PLCγ1), tSH2-WT, has been used to measure phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we found that tSH2-WT lacked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity for phosphorylated EGFR, consistent with the known promiscuity of SH2 domains. Further, EGF-stimulated membrane recruitment of tSH2-WT differed qualitatively from the expected kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation. Analysis of a mathematical model suggested, and experiments confirmed, that the high avidity of tSH2-WT resulted in saturation of its target and interference with EGFR endocytosis. To overcome the apparent target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and saturation issues, we implemented two protein engineering strategies. In the first approach, we screened a combinatorial library generated by random mutagenesis of the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of PLCγ1 and isolated a mutant form (mSH2) with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity for phosphorylated Tyr<sup>992</sup> (pTyr<sup>992</sup>) of EGFR. A biosensor based on mSH2 closely reported the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation but retained cross-reactivity similar to tSH2-WT. In the second approach, we isolated a pTyr<sup>992</sup>-binding protein (SPY992) from a combinatorial library generated by mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein scaffold. Compared to tSH2-WT and mSH2, SPY992 exhibited superior performance as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic, moderate-affinity biosensor. We extended this approach to isolate a biosensor for EGFR pTyr<sup>1148</sup> (SPY1148). This approach of integrating theoretical considerations with protein engineering strategies can be generalized to design and evaluate suitable biosensors for various phospho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic targets.</p>

Unbiased detection of CRISPR off-targets in vivo using DISCOVER-Seq

Current off-target discovery methods work using purified DNA or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic cellular models but are incapable of direct detection in vivo. We developed DISCOVER-Seq (discovery of in situ Cas off-targets and verification by sequencing), a universally applicable approach for unbiased off-target identification that leverages the recruitment of DNA repair factors in cells and organisms. Tracking the precise recruitment of MRE11 uncovers the molecular nature of Cas activity in cells with single-base resolution. DISCOVER-Seq works with multiple guide RNA formats and types of Cas enzymes, allowing characterization of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing tools. Off-targets can be identified in cell lines and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and during adenoviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing of mice, paving the way for in situ off-target discovery within individual patient genotypes during therapeutic genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing.</p>

Cap-specific terminal <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II–associated methyltransferase
<p><i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), a major modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), plays critical roles in RNA metabolism and function. In addition to the internal m<sup>6</sup>A, <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>, 2′-<i>O</i>-dimethyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of capped mRNAs in vertebrates.

Locally translated mTOR controls axonal local translation in nerve injury
<p>How is protein synthesis initiated locally in neurons? We found that mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) was activated and then up-regulated in injured axons, owing to local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion of mTOR messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA was transported into axons by the cell size–regulating RNA-binding protein nucleolin. Furthermore, mTOR controlled local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion in injured axons. This included regulation of its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion and that of retrograde injury signaling molecules such as importin β1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Deletion of the mTOR 3′ un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed region (3′UTR) in mice reduced mTOR in axons and decreased local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion after nerve injury. Both pharmacological inhibition of mTOR in axons and deletion of the mTOR 3′UTR decreased proprioceptive neuronal survival after nerve injury. Thus, mRNA localization enables spatiotemporal control of mTOR pathways regulating local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion and long-range intracellular signaling.</p>

Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium
<p>Asymmetric messenger RNA (mRNA) localization facilitates efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion in cells such as neurons and fibroblasts. However, the extent and importance of mRNA polarization in epithelial tissues are unclear. Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular polarization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in polarization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic boost in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion. This led to increased protein production, required for efficient nutrient absorption. These findings reveal a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism involving dynamic polarization of mRNA and polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion.</p>

Architecture of a transcribing-translating expressome
<p>DNA transcription is functionally coupled to messenger RNA (mRNA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion in bacteria, but how this is achieved remains unclear. Here we show that RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the ribosome of <i>Escherichia coli</i> can form a defined transcribing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ing “expressome” complex. The cryo–electron microscopic structure of the expressome reveals continuous protection of ~30 nucleotides of mRNA extending from the RNAP active center to the ribosome decoding center. The RNAP-ribosome interface includes the RNAP subunit α carboxyl-terminal domain, which is required for RNAP-ribosome interaction in vitro and for pronounced cell growth defects upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion inhibition in vivo, consistent with its function in transcription-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion coupling.

The structure of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome
<p>Mitochondria have specialized ribosomes (mitoribosomes) dedicated to the expression of the genetic information encoded by their genomes. Here, using electron cryomicroscopy, we have determined the structure of the 75-component yeast mitoribosome to an overall resolution of 3.3 angstroms. The mitoribosomal small subunit has been built de novo and includes 15<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 34 proteins, including 14 without homologs in the evolutionarily related bacterial ribosome.

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ing polysomes, and free ribonuclear particles, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ionally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ing monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regions.</p>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and plastids. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to heat. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plastid EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion, heat-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of heat-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in heat tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced heat tolerance. Compromised heat tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion under heat stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised heat-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the heat tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the plastid protein EF-Tu is heat sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant heat stress responses, primarily functioning in plastid protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear heat-responsive gene expression.</p>

Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are homologs of a yeast ribosome biogenesis factor that participates in late cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited growth of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> promoter, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its yeast homologs, REIL1 also was present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ing ribosome fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion machinery when grown at 10°C by accumulating cytosolic ribosome subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic ribosomal RNA, ribosomal genes, ribosome biogenesis factors, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited growth were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during growth at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant ribosome remodeling and enhance the accumulation of cytosolic ribosome subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ing ribosome fraction.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNA in early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos reveals hundreds of conserved translated sORFs
<p>There is growing recognition that small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding peptides shorter than 100 amino acids are an important class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome, with several already identified to play critical roles in growth, development, and disease. However, our understanding of their biological importance has been hindered owing to the significant technical challenges limiting their annotation. Here we combined ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs with rigorous conservation analysis to identify a comprehensive population of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed sORFs during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis. In total, we identify 399 sORFs, including those previously annotated but without evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional capacity, those found within transcripts previously classified as non-coding, and those not previously known to be transcribed. Further, we find, for the first time, evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion of many sORFs with different isoforms, suggesting their regulation is as complex as longer ORFs. Furthermore, many sORFs are found not associated with ribosomes in late-stage <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, suggesting that many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed sORFs may have stage-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic functions during embryogenesis. These results thus provide the first comprehensive annotation of the sORFs present during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis, a necessary basis for a detailed delineation of their function in embryogenesis and other biological processes.</p>

Validation included epigenetic and cellular assays. In terms of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity, we established an in vitro invasion-differentiation trophoblast model.

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Making Epidermal Bladder Cells Bigger: Developmental- and Salinity-Induced Endopolyploidy in a Model Halophyte
<p>Endopolyploidy occurs when DNA replication takes place without subsequent mitotic nuclear division, resulting in cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic ploidy levels within tissues. In plants, endopolyploidy plays an important role in sustaining growth and development, but only a few studies have demonstrated a role in abiotic stress response. In this study, we investigated the function of ploidy level and nuclear and cell size in leaf expansion throughout development and tracked cell type-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic ploidy in the halophyte <i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i>. In addition to developmental endopolyploidy, we examined the effects of salinity stress on ploidy level. We focused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically on epidermal bladder cells (EBC), which are modified balloon-like trichomes, due to their large size and role in salt accumulation. Our results demonstrate that ploidy increases as the leaves expand in a similar manner for each leaf type, and ploidy levels up to 512C were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed for nuclei in EBC of leaves of adult plants. Salt treatment led to a significant increase in ploidy levels in the EBC, and these cells showed spatially related differences in their ploidy and nuclear and cell size depending on the positions on the leaf and stem surface. Transcriptome analysis highlighted salinity-induced changes in genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, endoreduplication, and trichome development in EBC. The increase in cell size and ploidy observed in <i>M. crystallinum</i> under salinity stress may contribute to salt tolerance by increasing the storage capacity for sodium sequestration brought about by higher metabolic activity driving rapid cell enlargement in the leaf tissue and EBC.</p>

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ing fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer resistance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic activation response, including extreme resistance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type resistance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus resistance in the leaves into mild nematode resistance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate resistance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing screening tools in plant biology has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of biologically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ed DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>ing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 biology.</p>

Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regulators of phosphate starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed Phosphate starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in promoter-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in phosphate status and growth responses to phosphate availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of phosphate supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain growth under low phosphate supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot phosphate accumulation did not strictly correlate with organ growth. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of phosphate homeostasis, <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i>PHOSPHATE2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative growth responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly correlated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant growth under abiotic stress.</p>

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed germination relies on the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of germination. Study of 5′ un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed region features of these transcripts revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and germination. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in seeds (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the germination process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of germination and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subsets of mRNA.</p>

The IQD Family of Calmodulin-Binding Proteins Links Calcium Signaling to Microtubules, Membrane Subdomains, and the Nucleus
<p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential processes for the coordination and control of plant cell shape and cell growth. Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal sensors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular sites, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subcellular sites for precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic MT patterns, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell shape, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function, shape, and growth.</p>

Carotenogenesis Is Regulated by 5′UTR-Mediated Translation of Phytoene Synthase Splice Variants
<p>Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the highly regulated, frequently rate-limiting synthesis of the first biosynthetically formed carotene. While <i>PSY</i> constitutes a small gene family in most plant taxa, the Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), predominantly possess a single <i>PSY</i> gene. This monogenic situation is compensated by the differential expression of two alternative splice variants (ASV), which differ in length and in the exon/intron retention of their 5′UTRs. ASV1 contains a long 5′UTR (un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ed region) and is involved in developmentally regulated carotenoid formation, such as during deetiolation. ASV2 contains a short 5′UTR and is preferentially induced when an immediate increase in the carotenoid pathway flux is required, such as under salt stress or upon sudden light intensity changes. We show that the long 5′UTR of ASV1 is capable of attenuating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional activity in response to high carotenoid pathway fluxes. This function resides in a defined 5′UTR stretch with two predicted interconvertible RNA conformations, as known from riboswitches, which might act as a flux sensor. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ion-inhibitory structure is absent from the short 5′UTR of ASV2 allowing to bypass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional inhibition under conditions requiring rapidly increased pathway fluxes. The mechanism is not found in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>PSY1</i> 5′UTR, consistent with the prevalence of transcriptional control mechanisms in taxa with multiple <i>PSY</i> genes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">translat</span></strong>ional control mechanism identified is interpreted in terms of flux adjustments needed in response to retrograde signals stemming from intermediates of the plastid-localized carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity in this emerging model system.</p>

Vascular Smooth Muscle–Specific Progerin Expression Accelerates Atherosclerosis and Death in a Mouse Model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome

Patients who have HGPS exhibit ubiquitous progerin expression, accelerated aging and atherosclerosis, and die in their early teens, mainly of myocardial infarction or stroke.

Cardiovascular alterations were determined by immunofluorescence and histology in male mice fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. In vivo low-density lipoprotein retention was assessed by intravenous injection of fluorescently labeled human low-density lipoprotein. Cardiac electric defects were evaluated by electrocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice with ubiquitous progerin expression exhibited a premature aging phenotype that included failure to thrive and shortened survival. In addition, high-fat diet–fed <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice developed a severe vascular pathology, including medial VSMC loss and lipid retention, adventitial fibrosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis, thus resembling most aspects of cardiovascular disease observed in patients with HGPS.

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased. Modifications of the rule-in and rule-out thresholds did not improve the safety or overall efficacy of the 0/1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte metabolism and function.</p></sec>

Effect of Distinct Lifestyle Interventions on Mobilization of Fat Storage Pools
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We aimed to assess whether distinct lifestyle strategies can differentially affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic body adipose depots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an 18-month randomized controlled trial among 278 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity (75%) or dyslipidemia in an isolated workplace with a monitored provided lunch. Participants were randomized to isocaloric low-fat or M<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">edit</span></strong>erranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet+28 g walnuts/day with/without added moderate physical activity (PA; 80% aerobic; supervised/free gym membership). Overall primary outcome was body fat redistribution, and the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic end point was visceral adipose tissue (VAT). We further followed the dynamics of different fat depots (deep and superficial subcutaneous, liver, pericardial, muscle, pancreas, and renal sinus) by magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 278 participants (age, 48 years, 89% men, body mass index, 30.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 86% completed the trial with good adherence. The low-fat group preferentially decreased reported fat intake (−21.0% versus −11.5% for the MED/LC; <i>P</i><0.001), and the MED/LC group decreased reported carbohydrates intake (−39.5% versus −21.3% for the low-fat group; <i>P</i><0.001). The PA<sup>+</sup> groups significantly increased the metabolic equivalents per week versus the PA<sup>−</sup> groups (19.0 versus 2.1; <i>P</i>=0.009). Whereas final moderate weight loss was indifferent, exercise attenuated the waist circumference rebound with the greatest effect in the MED/LC<sup>PA+</sup> group (<i>P</i><0.05). VAT (−22%), intrahepatic (−29%), and intrapericardial (−11%) fats declines were higher than pancreatic and femur intermuscular fats (1% to 2%) loss. Independent of weight loss, PA<sup>+</sup> with either diet had a significantly greater effect on decreasing VAT (mean of difference, −6.67cm<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, −14.8 to −0.45) compared with PA<sup>−</sup>. The MED/LC diet was superior to the low-fat diet in decreasing intrahepatic, intrapericardial, and pancreatic fats (<i>P</i><0.05 for all). In contrast, renal sinus and femoral intermuscular fats were not differentially altered by lifestyle interventions but by weight loss per se. In multivariate models further adjusted for weight loss, losing VAT or intrahepatic fat was independently associated with improved lipid profile, losing deep subcutaneous adipose tissue with improved insulin sensitivity, and losing superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue remained neutral except for an association with decreased leptin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Moderate weight loss alone inadequately reflects the significant lifestyle effects on atherogenic and diabetogenic fat depots. The MED/LC diet mobilizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic ectopic fat depots, and exercise has an independent contribution to VAT loss. Fat depots exhibit diverse responsiveness and are differentially related to cardiometabolic markers. Distinct lifestyle protocols may uniquely induce fat mobilization from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic anatomic sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Vascular CXCR4 Limits Atherosclerosis by Maintaining Arterial Integrity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine ligand/receptor axis controls (progenitor) cell homeostasis and trafficking. So far, an atheroprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 has only been implied through pharmacological intervention, in particular, because the somatic deletion of the <i>CXCR4</i> gene in mice is embryonically lethal. Moreover, cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic effects of CXCR4 in the arterial wall and underlying mechanisms remain elusive, prompting us to investigate the relevance of CXCR4 in vascular cell types for atheroprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of vascular CXCR4 in atherosclerosis and plaque composition by inducing an endothelial cell (BmxCreER<sup>T2</sup>-driven)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic or smooth muscle cell (SMC, SmmhcCreER<sup>T2</sup>- or TaglnCre-driven)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic deficiency of <i>CXCR4</i> in an apolipoprotein E–deficient mouse model. To identify underlying mechanisms for effects of CXCR4, we studied endothelial permeability, intravital leukocyte adhesion, involvement of the Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and relevant phosphatases in VE-cadherin expression and function, vascular tone in aortic rings, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and expression of SMC phenotypic markers. Finally, we analyzed associations of common genetic variants at the <i>CXCR4</i> locus with the risk for coronary heart disease, along with <i>CXCR4</i> transcript expression in human atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic deletion of <i>CXCR4</i> in arterial endothelial cells (n=12–15) or SMCs (n=13–24) markedly increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in hyperlipidemic mice. Endothelial barrier function was promoted by CXCL12/CXCR4, which triggered Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling to drive VE-cadherin expression and stabilized junctional VE-cadherin complexes through associated phosphatases. Conversely, endothelial <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency caused arterial leakage and inflammatory leukocyte recruitment during atherogenesis. In arterial SMCs, CXCR4 sustained normal vascular reactivity and contractile responses, whereas <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency favored a synthetic phenotype, the occurrence of macrophage-like SMCs in the lesions, and impaired cholesterol efflux. Regression analyses in humans (n=259 796) identified the C-allele at <i>rs2322864</i> within the <i>CXCR4</i> locus to be associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. In line, C/C risk genotype carriers showed reduced CXCR4 expression in carotid artery plaques (n=188), which was furthermore associated with symptomatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data clearly establish that vascular CXCR4 limits atherosclerosis by maintaining arterial integrity, preserving endothelial barrier function, and a normal contractile SMC phenotype. Enhancing these beneficial functions of arterial CXCR4 by selective modulators might open novel therapeutic options in atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

RNA localization feeds translation
<p>The digestive tract has to cope with the challenge of functioning efficiently despite irregular cycles of eating and fasting. Digestion and absorption of nutrients require large quantities of proteins, mainly enzymes and transporters (<i>1</i>). Although these proteins must be available in the epithelial cells that line the stomach and intestines within minutes upon feeding, their continuous production would impose high upkeep costs on the fasting organism. On page 1299 of this issue, Moor <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify a mechanism that may account for the responsiveness of the digestive system: The monolayer of enterocytes (which form the intestinal epithelium) controls protein expression at the level of translation, through regulated RNA localization.</p>

Outcomes after early return to theatre following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Hip hemiarthroplasty is a standard treatment for intracapsular   proximal femoral fractures in the frail elderly. In this study we   have explored the implications of early return to theatre, within   30 days, on patient outcome following hip hemiarthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of all hip hemiarthroplasties   performed in our unit between January 2010 and January 2015. Demographic   details, medical backround, details of the primary procedure, complications,   subsequent procedures requiring return to theatre, re-admissions,   discharge destination and death were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 705 procedures were included; 428 Austin Moore and   277 Exeter Trauma Stems were used. A total of 34 fractures (in 33   patients) required early return to theatre within 30 days. Age,   gender, laterality, time from admission to primary procedure, American   Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and implant type were similar   for those requiring early return to theatre and those who did not.   Early return to theatre was associated with a significantly higher   length of stay (mean 33.6 days (7 to 107) <i>versus</i> 18.6   days (0 to 152), p < 0.001), re-admission rate (38.2% <i>versus</i> 8.6%,   p < 0.001), and subsequent revision rate (17.6% <i>versus</i> 1.3%,   p < 0.001). We found no difference in level of care required   on discharge or mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Proximal femoral fractures are common in the elderly population,   with far-reaching medical and economic implications. Factors such   as infection or dislocation may require early return to theatre,   and this is associated with outcomes which may be both medically   and economically detrimental. This illustrates the importance of   avoiding early complications to improve longer term outcome.</p><p>Return to theatre within 30 days is associated with longer length   of stay, higher re-admission rate, and higher subsequent revision   rate. It may be a useful short-term quality indicator for longer   term outcome measures following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular   fractures of the proximal femur.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:958â€“63.</p></sec>

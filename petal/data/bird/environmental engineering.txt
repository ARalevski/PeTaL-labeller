Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and plastids. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plastid EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced plastid translation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the plastid protein EF-Tu is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress responses, primarily functioning in plastid protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression.</p>

STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature stress often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental stress conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcripts including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for specific subsets of stress-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment. The findings of this study reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant stress tolerance to high-temperature stress.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments but induced escape behavior in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments
<p>Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We assessed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Our <bold>G</bold> matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shelter</span></strong>ed lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shelter</span></strong>ed sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shelter</span></strong>ed site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>ing, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs.

Glucose-Regulated <i>HLP1</i> Acts as a Key Molecule in Governing Thermomemory
<p>Induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins (HSPs) in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress (HS) is indispensable for conferring thermotolerance. Glc, a fundamental signaling and metabolic molecule, provides energy to stressed seedlings to combat stress. The recovery of stressed plants from detrimental HS in response to Glc is largely mediated by HSPs, but the mechanistic basis of this thermotolerance is not well defined. In this study, we show that Glc has a prominent role in providing thermotolerance. Glc-mediated thermotolerance involves HSP induction via the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR)-E2Fa signaling module. Apart from HSPs, TOR-E2Fa also regulates the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ortholog of human <i>Hikeshi</i>, named <i>HIKESHI</i>-<i>LIKE PROTEIN1</i> (<i>HLP1</i>). Expression of <i>proHLP1</i>::<i>GUS</i> in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) after HS coincides with TOR-E2Fa expression, substantiating a role for TOR-E2Fa-HLP1 in providing thermotolerance. We also demonstrate that Glc along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> could induce proliferation activity in the SAM after HS recovery, which was arrested by the TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. Molecular and physiological studies suggest that HS-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress transcription factor A1s also positively regulate <i>HLP1</i> transcription, suggesting convergence of the Glc and HS signaling pathways. Loss of functional HLP1 causes HS hypersensitivity, whereas HLP1 overexpressors display increased thermotolerance. HLP1 binds to the promoters of Glc-regulated HS-responsive genes and promotes chromatin acetylation. In addition, Glc modifies the chromatin landscape at thermomemory-related loci by promoting H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Glc-primed accumulation of H3K4me3 at thermomemory-associated loci is mediated through HLP1. These findings reveal the novel function of Glc-regulated <i>HLP1</i> in mediating thermotolerance/thermomemory response.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and high temperature (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> [H]). Since <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> constraints in w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components.

We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high temperature. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-temperature treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high temperature. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high temperatures. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high temperature. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient temperature increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high temperature. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high temperature at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The 2010 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation allow 5 seconds to give 2 breaths to deliver sufficient chest compressions and to keep perfusion pressure high. This study aims to determine whether the recommended short interruption for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ations by trained lay rescuers and first responders can be achieved and to evaluate its consequence for chest compressions and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From a prospective data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we used automatic external defibrillator recordings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by rescuers who had received a standard European Resuscitation Council basic life support and automatic external defibrillator course. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ation periods and total compressions delivered per minute during each 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle were measured, and the chest compression fraction was calculated. Neurological intact survival to discharge was studied in relation to these factors and covariates. We included 199 automatic external defibrillator recordings. The median interruption time for 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ations was 7 seconds (25th–75th percentile, 6–9 seconds). Of all rescuers, 21% took <5 seconds and 83% took <10 seconds for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ation period; 97%, 88%, and 63% of rescuers were able to deliver >60, >70, and >80 chest compressions per minute, respectively. The median chest compression fraction was 65% (25th–75th percentile, 59%–71%). Survival was 25% (49 of 199), not associated with long or short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ation pauses when controlled for covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The great majority of rescuers can give 2 rescue breaths in <10 seconds and deliver at least 70 compressions in a minute. Longer pauses for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ations are not associated with worse outcome. Guidelines may allow longer pauses for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ations with no detriment to survival.</p></sec>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>ed catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Schema cells in the macaque hippocampus
<p>Concept cells in the human hippocampus encode the meaning conveyed by stimuli over their perceptual aspects. Here we investigate whether analogous cells in the macaque can form conceptual schemas of spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Each day, monkeys were presented with a familiar and a novel virtual maze, sharing a common schema but differing by surface features (landmarks). In both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, animals searched for a hidden reward goal only defined in relation to landmarks. With learning, many neurons developed a firing map integrating goal-centered and task-related information of the novel maze that matched that for the familiar maze. Thus, these hippocampal cells abstract the spatial concepts from the superficial details of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and encode space into a schema-like representation.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein circuit design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit architectures. In this study, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Ancient convergent losses of <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> yield potential risks for modern marine mammals
<p>Mammals diversified by colonizing drastically different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, with each transition yielding numerous molecular changes, including losses of protein function. Though not initially deleterious, these losses could subsequently carry deleterious pleiotropic consequences. We have used phylogenetic methods to identify convergent functional losses across independent marine mammal lineages. In one extreme case, <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> (<i>PON1</i>) accrued lesions in all marine lineages, while remaining intact in all terrestrial mammals. These lesions coincide with PON1 enzymatic activity loss in marine species’ blood plasma. This convergent loss is likely explained by parallel shifts in marine ancestors’ lipid metabolism and/or bloodstream oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment affecting PON1’s role in fatty acid oxidation. PON1 loss also eliminates marine mammals’ main defense against neurotoxicity from specific man-made organophosphorus compounds, implying potential risks in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that strategies that promote student interactions and cognitively engage students with content (<i>1</i>) lead to gains in learning and attitudinal outcomes for students in science, technology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering, and mathematics (STEM) courses (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>).

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state refrigeration offers potential advantages over traditional cooling systems, but few devices offer high specific cooling power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces. We developed a cooling device with a high intrinsic thermodynamic efficiency using a flexible electrocaloric (EC) polymer film and an electrostatic actuation mechanism. Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> transfer through good thermal contacts with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> source or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> sink. The EC device produced a specific cooling power of 2.8 watts per gram and a COP of 13. The new cooling device is more efficient and compact than existing surface-conformable solid-state cooling technologies, opening a path to using the technology for a variety of practical applications.</p>

An environment-dependent transcriptional network specifies human microglia identity
<p>Microglia play essential roles in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and influence diverse aspects of neuronal function. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that specify human microglia phenotypes are largely unknown. We examined the transcriptomes and epigenetic landscapes of human microglia isolated from surgically resected brain tissue ex vivo and after transition to an in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Transfer to a tissue culture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment resulted in rapid and extensive down-regulation of microglia-specific genes that were induced in primitive mouse macrophages after migration into the fetal brain. Substantial subsets of these genes exhibited altered expression in neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases and were associated with noncoding risk variants.

Bragg coherent diffractive imaging of single-grain defect dynamics in polycrystalline films
<p>Polycrystalline material properties depend on the distribution and interactions of their crystalline grains. In particular, grain boundaries and defects are crucial in determining their response to external stimuli. A long-standing challenge is thus to observe individual grains, defects, and strain dynamics inside functional materials. Here we report a technique capable of revealing grain heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocations, that can be used under operando conditions in reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments: grain Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (gBCDI). Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>ing, we show how gBCDI resolves grain boundary and dislocation dynamics in individual grains in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom displacement field resolution.

Mechanisms of reef coral resistance to future climate change
<p>Reef corals are highly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, yet populations resistant to climate change have recently been identified. To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. Male cones generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> even in cool weather conditions. Female cones produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, but to a lesser extent than male cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of male cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in male cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Etiolated Stem Branching Is a Result of Systemic Signaling Associated with Sucrose Level
<p>The potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) tuber is a swollen stem. Sprouts growing from the tuber nodes represent loss of apical dominance and branching. Long cold storage induces loss of tuber apical dominance and results in secondary branching. Here, we show that a similar branching pattern can be induced by short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment of the tubers. Detached sprouts were induced to branch by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment only when attached to a parenchyma cylinder. Grafting experiments showed that the scion branches only when grafted onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>- or cold-treated tuber parenchyma, suggesting that the branching signal is transmitted systemically from the bud-base parenchyma to the grafted stem. Exogenous supply of sucrose (Suc), glucose, or fructose solution to detached sprouts induced branching in a dose-responsive manner, and an increase in Suc level was observed in tuber parenchyma upon branching induction, suggesting a role for elevated parenchyma sugars in the regulation of branching. However, sugar analysis of the apex and node after grafting showed no distinct differences in sugar levels between branching and nonbranching stems. Vacuolar invertase is a key enzyme in determining the level of Suc and its cleavage products, glucose and fructose, in potato parenchyma. Silencing of the vacuolar invertase-encoding gene led to increased tuber branching in combination with branching-inducing treatments. These results suggest that Suc in the parenchyma induces branching through signaling and not by excess mobilization from the parenchyma to the stem.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

PECTIN METHYLESTERASE34 Contributes to Heat Tolerance through Its Role in Promoting Stomatal Movement
<p>Pectin, a major component of the primary cell wall, is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and exported to the cell wall in a highly methylesterified form, then is partially demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; EC 3.1.1.11). PME activity on the status of pectin methylesterification profoundly affects the properties of pectin and, thereby, is critical for plant development and the plant defense response, although the roles of PMEs under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress (HS) are poorly understood. Functional genome annotation predicts that at least 66 potential <i>PME</i> genes are contained in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thermotolerance assays of <i>PME</i> gene T-DNA insertion lines revealed two null mutant alleles of <i>PME34</i> (At3g49220) that both consistently showed reduced thermotolerance. Nevertheless, their impairment was independently associated with the expression of HS-responsive genes. It was also observed that <i>PME34</i> transcription was induced by abscisic acid and highly expressed in guard cells. We showed that the <i>PME34</i> mutation has a defect in the control of stomatal movement and greatly altered PME and polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) activity, resulting in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype. <i>PME34</i> has a role in the regulation of transpiration through the control of the stomatal aperture due to its cell wall-modifying enzyme activity during the HS response. Hence, PME34 is required for regulating guard cell wall flexibility to mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> response in Arabidopsis.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment

The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Profiles of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. Unaltered by Heat Stress in a Coral Host
<p>Dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> form an endosymbiosis with reef building corals, in which photosynthetically derived nutrients comprise the majority of the coral energy budget. An extraordinary amount of functional and genetic diversity is contained within the coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> with some phylotypes (i.e., genotypic groupings), conferring enhanced stress tolerance to host corals. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of the stress response of the cnidarian coral host; however, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular response to stress of coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> as well as differences among physiologically susceptible and tolerant types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the transcriptome-wide response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress via RNA-Seq of two types of <i>Symbiodinium,</i> the putatively thermotolerant type D2 and the more susceptible type C3K, resident within the same coral host species, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i>. Contrary to previous findings with coral hosts, we find no detectable change in gene expression across the dinoflagellate transcriptome after 3 days of elevated thermal exposure, despite physical evidence of symbiosis breakdown. However, hundreds of genes identified as orthologs between the C and D types exhibited significant expression differences within treatments (i.e., attributable solely to type, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> exposure). These include many genes related to known thermotolerance mechanisms including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins and chloroplast membrane components. Additionally, both the between-treatment similarities and between-type differences remained pervasive after 12–18 months of common garden acclimation and in mixed <i>Symbiodinium</i> assemblages within the same coral host colony.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> acclimation with no influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest
<p>Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to secrete or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and secrete large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and metabolism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized metabolites with high industrial or pharmacological value.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> growth and also shows potential for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>.</p>

Preferential Distribution of Boron to Developing Tissues Is Mediated by the Intrinsic Protein OsNIP3
<p>Boron is especially required for the growth of meristem and reproductive organs, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of B to these developing tissues are poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a member of nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP), OsNIP3;1, is involved in this preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). <i>OsNIP3</i>;<i>1</i> was highly expressed in the nodes and its expression was up-regulated by B deficiency, but down-regulated by high B. OsNIP3;1 was polarly localized at the xylem parenchyma cells of enlarged vascular bundles of nodes facing toward the xylem vessels. Furthermore, this protein was rapidly degraded within a few hours in response to high B. Knockout of this gene hardly affected the uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of B, but altered B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion in different organs in the above-ground parts, decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of B to the new leaves, and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion to the old leaves. These results indicate that OsNIP3;1 located in the nodes is involved in the preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of B to the developing tissues by unloading B from the xylem in rice and that it is regulated at both transcriptional and protein level in response to external B level.</p>

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Biological uptake and reversible scavenging of zinc in the global ocean
<p>Zinc (Zn) is a key micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, with a global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion that is similar to silicic acid. The processes that govern this relationship, despite the very different biological cycling of Zn and silica, remain poorly understood. Here, we use diagnostic and mechanistic models to show that only a combination of Southern Ocean biological uptake and reversible scavenging of Zn onto sinking particles can explain the observations. The distinction between organic and adsorbed Zn can also reconcile the vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion and mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e of Zn isotopes, which previously appeared at odds. This holistic understanding explains the Zn deficiencies observed throughout the low-latitude ocean and implies a greater sensitivity of the marine Zn cycle to climate-driven changes in organic matter cycling than previously recognized.</p>

A whirling plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A challenges cold dark matter cosmology
<p>The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are each surrounded by a thin plane of satellite dwarf galaxies that may be corotating. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical simulations predict that most satellite galaxy systems are close to isotropic with random motions, so those two well-studied systems are often interpreted as rare statistical outliers. We test this assumption using the kinematics of satellite galaxies around the Centaurus A galaxy. Our statistical analysis reveals evidence for corotation in a narrow plane: Of the 16 Centaurus A satellites with kinematic data, 14 follow a coherent velocity pattern aligned with the long axis of their spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion. In standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical simulations, <0.5% of Centaurus A–like systems show such behavior. Corotating satellite systems may be common in the universe, challenging small-scale structure formation in the prevailing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical paradigm.</p>

A subcellular map of the human proteome
<p>Resolving the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of the human proteome at a subcellular level can greatly increase our understanding of human biology and disease. Here we present a comprehensive image-based map of subcellular protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion, the Cell Atlas, built by integrating transcriptomics and antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy with validation by mass spectrometry. Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments. This subcellular map can be used to refine existing protein-protein interaction networks and provides an important resource to deconvolute the highly complex architecture of the human cell.</p>

Measurement of the small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium using close quasar pairs
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of diffuse gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) imprints a series of hydrogen absorption lines on the spectra of distant background quasars known as the Lyman-α forest. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that IGM density fluctuations are suppressed below a characteristic scale where thermal pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>es gravity. We measured this pressure-smoothing scale by quantifying absorption correlations in a sample of close quasar pairs. We compared our measurements to hydrodynamical simulations, where pressure smoothing is determined by the integrated thermal history of the IGM. Our findings are consistent with standard models for photoionization heating by the ultraviolet radiation backgrounds that reionized the universe.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and immobile regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional imaging using superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed to immobile ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into immobile ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the immobile tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed to immobile tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion that is preserved in different environments. The mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments
<p>The successful incorporation of active proteins into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, proteins rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of trends in protein sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on protein surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered proteins for protein solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments. The heteropolymers, with optimized composition and statistical monomer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion, enable cell-free synthesis of membrane proteins with proper protein folding for transport and enzyme-containing plastics for toxin bioremediation. Controlling the statistical monomer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion in a heteropolymer, rather than the specific monomer sequence, affords a new strategy to interface with biological systems for protein-based biomaterials.</p>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940
<p>We estimated rates of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of children who earn more than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility.

Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance
<p>Crop breeding aims to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e disease resistance with yield; however, single resistance (R) genes can lead to resistance breakdown, and R gene pyramiding may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice <i>Pigm</i> locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable resistance to the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR confers broad-spectrum resistance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress resistance. <i>PigmS</i> expression, and thus <i>PigmR</i>-mediated resistance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. <i>PigmS</i> increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by <i>PigmR</i>.

Organelle inheritance—what players have skin in the game?
<p>The concept of a checkpoint that monitors chromosome attachment to microtubules, and the discovery of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint proteins constituted a major milestone in understanding eukaryotic cell division (<i>1</i>). Chromosomes, however, are not the only constituents that have to be partitioned. Membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and mitochondria are typically copied from existing structures, and it is necessary that both daughter cells receive a share of these components. On page 493 of this issue, Asare <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide an exciting new view of organelle inheritance. The authors identify an organelle protein called peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11 beta (PEX11b) as a key determinant in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e between dividing and differentiating cells in the mammalian epidermis.

The induction of mitophagy, a quality control process in mitochondria, plays an essential role in self-renewing expansion of <i>Tie2<sup>+</sup></i> HSCs. Activation of the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor)–fatty acid oxidation pathway promotes expansion of <i>Tie2</i><sup>+</sup> HSCs through enhanced Parkin recruitment in mitochondria.

Our data thus identify mitophagy as a key mechanism of HSC expansion and suggest potential methods of cell-fate manipulation through metabolic pathways.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>y, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of the spacing between topological defects.

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid separation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids separated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ed separation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Micro Imaging Displays the Sucrose Landscape within and along Its Allocation Pathways
<p>Sucrose (Suc) is the major transport sugar in plants and plays a primary role as an energy source and signal in adaptive and stress responses. An ability to quantify Suc over time and space would serve to advance our understanding of these important processes. Current technologies used for Suc mapping are unable to quantitatively visualize its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion within tissues. Here, we present an infrared-based microspectroscopic method that allows for the quantitative visualization of Suc at a microscopic level of resolution (∼12 µm). This method can successfully model the sugar concentration in individual vascular bundles and within a complex organ such as the stem, leaf, or seed. The sensitivity of the assay ranges from 20 to 1,000 m<sc>m</sc>. We applied this method to the cereal crop barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to highlight the potential of the procedure for resolving the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of metabolites. We also discuss the relevance of the method for studies on carbon allocation and storage in the context of crop improvement.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion to different organs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in rice. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the concentrations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu concentration in older leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the rice heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed yeast cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in rice.</p>

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the lipids phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e the levels of these lipids to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the conversion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon freezing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that freezing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During freezing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide production compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA production in response to freezing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the conversion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant freezing tolerance, acting by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing TAG and PA production in Arabidopsis.</p>

Revised Phylogeny of the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> Gene Superfamily: Insights into Cell Wall Evolution
<p>Cell walls are crucial for the integrity and function of all land plants and are of central importance in human health, livestock production, and as a source of renewable bioenergy. Many enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides are encoded by members of the large <i>cellulose synthase</i> (<i>CesA</i>) gene superfamily. Here, we analyzed 29 sequenced genomes and 17 transcriptomes to revise the phylogeny of the <i>CesA</i> gene superfamily in angiosperms. Our results identify ancestral gene clusters that predate the monocot-eudicot divergence and reveal several novel evolutionary observations, including the expansion of the Poaceae-specific cellulose synthase-like <i>CslF</i> family to the graminids and restiids and the characterization of a previously unreported eudicot lineage, <i>CslM</i>, that forms a reciprocally monophyletic eudicot-monocot grouping with the <i>CslJ</i> clade. The <i>CslM</i> lineage is widely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed in eudicots, and the <i>CslJ</i> clade, which was thought previously to be restricted to the Poales, is widely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed in monocots. Our analyses show that some members of the <i>CslJ</i> lineage, but not the newly identified <i>CslM</i> genes, are capable of directing (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan biosynthesis, which, contrary to current dogma, is not restricted to Poaceae.</p>

Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is mainly occupied by homogeneous polygonal starch from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) starches have been identified in some rice mutants. How these heterogeneous starches form remains unknown. A high-amylose rice line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i>starch branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> contains four heterogeneous starches: polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch; these starches are regionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous starches in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of starch. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent regular changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous starches were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were mainly due to the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in starch might remove steric hindrance and provide extra space for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

Spatial Mapping and Profiling of Metabolite Distributions during Germination
<p>Germination is a highly complex process by which seeds begin to develop and establish themselves as viable organisms. In this study, we utilize a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-fluorescence, and mass spectrometry imaging approaches to profile and visualize the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ions of germinating seeds from two different inbreds of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seeds, B73 and Mo17. Gas chromatography and liquid chromatography analyses demonstrate that the two inbreds are highly differentiated in their metabolite profiles throughout the course of germination, especially with regard to amino acids, sugar alcohols, and small organic acids. Crude dissection of the seed followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many compounds were highly sequestered among the various seed tissue types. To further localize compounds, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize compounds in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Gas Exchange: The Balance between Carbon Fixation and Water Loss
<p>Stomatal control of transpiration is critical for maintaining important processes, such as plant water status, leaf temperature, as well as permitting sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into the leaf to maintain photosynthetic rates (<i>A</i>). Stomatal conductance often closely correlates with <i>A</i> and is thought to control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e between water loss and carbon gain. It has been suggested that a mesophyll-driven signal coordinates <i>A</i> and stomatal conductance responses to maintain this relationship; however, the signal has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite this correlation under stable environmental conditions, the responses of both parameters vary spatially and temporally and are dependent on species, environment, and plant water status. Most current models neglect these aspects of gas exchange, although it is clear that they play a vital role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e of carbon fixation and water loss. Future efforts should consider the dynamic nature of whole-plant gas exchange and how it represents much more than the sum of its individual leaf-level components, and they should take into consideration the long-term effect on gas exchange over time.</p>

Global Sensitivity Analysis of OnGuard Models Identifies Key Hubs for Transport Interaction in Stomatal Dynamics
<p>The physical requirement for charge to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e across biological membranes means that the transmembrane transport of each ionic species is interrelated, and manipulating solute flux through any one transporter will affect other transporters at the same membrane, often with unforeseen consequences. The OnGuard systems modeling platform has helped to resolve the mechanics of stomatal movements, uncovering previously unexpected behaviors of stomata. To date, however, the manual approach to exploring model parameter space has captured little formal information about the emergent connections between parameters that define the most interesting properties of the system as a whole. Here, we introduce global sensitivity analysis to identify interacting parameters affecting a number of outputs commonly accessed in experiments in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The analysis highlights synergies between transporters affecting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release pathways, notably those associated with internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and their turnover. Other, unexpected synergies appear, including with the plasma membrane anion channels and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and with the tonoplast TPK K<sup>+</sup> channel. These emergent synergies, and the core hubs of interaction that they define, identify subsets of transporters associated with free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that represent key targets to enhance plant performance in the future. They also highlight the importance of interactions between the voltage regulation of the plasma membrane and tonoplast in coordinating transport between the different cellular compartments.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>e diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward auxin transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the inhibition of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing and positive selection are species-specific, with signatures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of biological structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune gene diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin genes were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five genes showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these genes in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin gene (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this gene, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin genes allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune genes, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> genes, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C gene (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C genes. A larger 5′ extended gene could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> gene complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in gene C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> gene within the larger C<sub>B</sub> gene and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ed’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ed high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ed diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ed high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>ed high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">balanc</span></strong>e on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

The analysis of synovial fluid in total knee arthroplasties with flexion instability
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with flexion instability after total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) often present with a recurrent effusion, which may be a haemarthrosis.   While the radiographic factors contributing to flexion instability   have been elucidated, the clinical diagnosis remains challenging.

The results of the   pre-operative aspiration of synovial fluid were available for 53   patients (88%). These patients were 1:2 matched to 106 patients   who underwent aseptic TKA for indications other than flexion instability.

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for ablation. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the bone during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

ChloroMitoSSRDB: Open Source Repository of Perfect and Imperfect Repeats in Organelle Genomes for Evolutionary Genomics
<p>Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are repetitive stretches of nucleotides (A, T, G, C) that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed either as single base pair stretches or as a combination of two- to six-nucleotides units that are non-randomly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed within coding and in non-coding regions of the genome. ChloroMitoSSRDB is a complete curated web-oriented relational database of perfect and imperfect repeats in organelle genomes. The present version of the database contains perfect and imperfect SSRs of 2161 organelle genomes (1982 mitochondrial and 179 chloroplast genomes). We detected a total of 5838 chloroplast perfect SSRs, 37 297 chloroplast imperfect SSRs, 5898 mitochondrial perfect SSRs and 50 355 mitochondrial imperfect SSRs across these genomes. The repeats have been further hyperlinked to the annotated gene regions (coding or non-coding) and a link to the corresponding gene record in National Center for Biotechnology Information(<ext-link>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to identify and understand the positional relationship of the repetitive tracts. ChloroMitoSSRDB is connected to a user-friendly web interface that provides useful information associated with the location of the repeats (coding and non-coding), size of repeat, motif and length polymorphism, etc. ChloroMitoSSRDB will serve as a repository for developing functional markers for molecular phylogenetics, estimating molecular variation across species. Database URL: ChloroMitoSSRDB can be accessed as an open source repository at <ext-link>www.mcr.org.in/chloromitossrdb</ext-link>.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
An atrial-fibrillation-linked connexin40 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impairs the function of atrial gap-junction channels
<p>Connexin40 (Cx40)-containing gap-junction channels are expressed in the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the <i>GJA5</i> gene, which encodes Cx40, resulting in a truncated Cx40 (Q49X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant way over generations. To test the hypothesis that this Cx40 mutant affects the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion and function of atrial gap junctions, we studied the Q49X mutant in gap-junction-deficient HeLa and N2A cells. The Q49X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx40, was typically localized in the cytoplasm and failed to form gap-junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q49X mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43, the mutant substantially reduced the gap-junction plaque formation of Cx40 and Cx43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and a significant decrease in the coupling conductance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43. Further colocalization experiments with the organelle residential proteins indicate that Q49X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q49X mutant is capable of impairing gap-junction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in the predisposition to and onset of AF.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed dozens of novel genetic determinants of proteins associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis.

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conif</span></strong>erous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conif</span></strong>erous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conif</span></strong>ers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss depict the scale and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation) from temporary loss from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss can be attributed to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation has not declined. To end de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.</p>

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian brain contains diverse neuronal types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed regulatory elements with differential methylation across neuron types. Methylation signatures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a layer 6 excitatory neuron subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neuron subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of regulatory elements in inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons.

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed five CT-related genetic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic loci related to CT have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Source of CpG Depletion in the HIV-1 Genome
<p>The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG depletion in the HIV-1 genome, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the reduction of CpG in its genome. A CpG depleted genome would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG depletion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. We found that in both human and HIV-1 genomes the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were depleted most and those flanked by C/G were depleted least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG depletion pattern was observed for the human genome within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG depletion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.</p>

After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter.

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function.

Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity.

Downstream miR targets were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed via bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter gene assays.

Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology.

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian clock relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for degradation of core regulatory components, which drives clock progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target clock components for degradation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. Degradation of the circadian clock component PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion by β-transducin repeat–containing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-box–containing proteins that function as substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 degradation machinery. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for degradation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian clock and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the clock as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

CDK12-mediated transcriptional regulation of noncanonical NF-κB components is essential for signaling
<p>Members of the family of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors are critical for multiple cellular processes, including regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Canonical NF-κB complexes are retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein IκBα, whereas noncanonical NF-κB complexes are retained by p100. Although activation of canonical NF-κB signaling through the IκBα kinase complex is well studied, few regulators of the NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)–dependent processing of noncanonical p100 to p52 and the subsequent nuclear translocation of p52 have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed.

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p>Neurons modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate systemic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during neuronal development, but few other nuclear targets of S-nitrosylation have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical neurons and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any system, and 555 are previously un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed targets of S-nitrosylation in neurons. The sites of S-nitrosylation were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical neurons in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in neurons and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

Genome-wide functional analysis reveals central signaling regulators of lymphatic endothelial cell migration and remodeling
<p>Lymphatic vessels constitute a specialized vasculature that is involved in development, cancer, obesity, and immune regulation. The migration of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is critical for vessel growth (lymphangiogenesis) and vessel remodeling, processes that modify the lymphatic network in response to developmental or pathological demands. Using the publicly accessible results of our genome-wide siRNA screen, we characterized the migratome of primary human LECs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed individual genes and signaling pathways that regulate LEC migration. We compared our data set with mRNA differential expression data from endothelial and stromal cells derived from two in vivo models of lymphatic vessel remodeling, viral infection and contact hypersensitivity–induced inflammation, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed genes selectively involved in regulating LEC migration and remodeling. We also characterized the top candidates in the LEC migratome in primary blood vascular endothelial cells to identify genes with functions common to lymphatic and blood vascular endothelium. On the basis of these analyses, we showed that <i>LGALS1</i>, which encodes the glycan-binding protein Galectin-1, promoted lymphatic vascular growth in vitro and in vivo and contributed to maintenance of the lymphatic endothelial phenotype. Our results provide insight into the signaling networks that control lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling and potentially identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers in disease specific to lymphatic or blood vessels.</p>

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing network more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the core face-processing network into a familiar face-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion system.</p>

Causal neural network of metamemory for retrospection in primates
<p>We know how confidently we know: Metacognitive self-monitoring of memory states, so-called “metamemory,” enables strategic and efficient information collection based on past experiences. However, it is unknown how metamemory is implemented in the brain. We explored causal neural mechanism of metamemory in macaque monkeys performing metacognitive confidence judgments on memory. By whole-brain searches via functional magnetic resonance imaging, we discovered a neural correlate of metamemory for temporally remote events in prefrontal area 9 (or 9/46d), along with that for recent events within area 6. Reversible inactivation of each of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed loci induced doubly dissociated selective impairments in metacognitive judgment performance on remote or recent memory, without impairing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion performance itself.

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation

Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>.

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify the protein interactors of AGB1. After eliminating proteins present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed contaminants, and organellar proteins, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated proteins were confidently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed.

We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G protein-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G protein-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G proteins.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield.

In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, many of which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate whether all of these accessions are defective in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of metal ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Radiological investigations   were used to assess the Anderson and D’Alonzo classification and   displacement of the fracture. The mean age was 82.9 years (65 to   101). Most patients (66; 79.5%) had a type 2 fracture. An associated   neurological deficit was present in 11 (13.3%).

Ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNA in early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos reveals hundreds of conserved translated sORFs
<p>There is growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion that small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding peptides shorter than 100 amino acids are an important class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome, with several already <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed to play critical roles in growth, development, and disease. However, our understanding of their biological importance has been hindered owing to the significant technical challenges limiting their annotation. Here we combined ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs with rigorous conservation analysis to identify a comprehensive population of translated sORFs during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis. In total, we identify 399 sORFs, including those previously annotated but without evidence of translational capacity, those found within transcripts previously classified as non-coding, and those not previously known to be transcribed. Further, we find, for the first time, evidence for translation of many sORFs with different isoforms, suggesting their regulation is as complex as longer ORFs. Furthermore, many sORFs are found not associated with ribosomes in late-stage <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, suggesting that many of the translated sORFs may have stage-specific functions during embryogenesis. These results thus provide the first comprehensive annotation of the sORFs present during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis, a necessary basis for a detailed delineation of their function in embryogenesis and other biological processes.</p>

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction. Subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction and cardiac death were reported at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4726 patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, 904 (19%) had renal impairment.

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not different. This was also not significant when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ating each valve type separately.

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective fibrosis in mice. We have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), fibrosis (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals.

In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC test (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any abnormality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64). Coronary computed tomographic angiography provided significantly better prognostic information compared with FT and CAC testing (C index, 0.72).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among stable outpatients presenting with suspected coronary artery disease, most patients experiencing clinical events have measurable CAC at baseline, and fewer than half have any abnormalities on FT.

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Genetic Obesity and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed an association between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Inferring causality from observational studies, however, is subject to residual confounding, reverse causation, and bias. The primary objective of this study was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the causal association between BMI and AF by using genetic predictors of BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 51 646 individuals of European ancestry without AF at baseline from 7 prospective population-based cohorts initiated between 1987 and 2002 in the United States, Iceland, and the Netherlands with incident AF ascertained between 1987 and 2012. Cohort-specific mean follow-up ranged from 7.4 to 19.2 years, over which period there was a total of 4178 cases of incident AF. We performed a Mendelian randomization with instrumental variable analysis to estimate a cohort-specific causal hazard ratio for the association between BMI and AF. Two genetic instruments for BMI were used: <i>FTO</i> genotype (rs1558902) and a BMI gene score comprising 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by genome-wide association studies to be associated with BMI. Cohort-specific estimates were combined by random-effects, inverse variance–weighted meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis, both genetic instruments were significantly associated with BMI (<i>FTO</i>: 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.54] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per A-allele, <i>P</i><0.001; BMI gene score: 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.20] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001) and incident AF (<i>FTO</i>, hazard ratio, 1.07 [1.02–1.11] per A-allele, <i>P</i>=0.004; BMI gene score, hazard ratio, 1.11 [1.05–1.18] per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted instrumental variable estimates for the causal association between BMI and incident AF were hazard ratio, 1.15 (1.04–1.26) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i>=0.005 (<i>FTO</i>) and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001 (BMI gene score). Both of these estimates were consistent with the meta-analyzed estimate between observed BMI and AF (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio 1.05 [1.04–1.06] per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable adjustment did not significantly change findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data are consistent with a causal relationship between BMI and incident AF. These data support the possibility that public health initiatives targeting primordial prevention of obesity may reduce the incidence of AF.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize patient management, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk patients. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart failure, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart failure (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was analyzed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart failure was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed those patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional risk marker model in patients with ACHD and can reliably exclude the risk of death and heart failure. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events. These biomarkers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and management of patients with ACHD.</p></sec>

Incident Type 2 Myocardial Infarction in a Cohort of Patients Undergoing Coronary or Peripheral Arterial Angiography
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI; related to supply/demand mismatch), little is known about its risk factors or its association with outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A single-center cohort of patients undergoing coronary or peripheral angiography with or without intervention was prospectively enrolled and followed for incident type 1 and T2MI, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial complication, and cardiac arrhythmia), as well. T2MI was adjudicated using criteria from the Third Universal Definition of MI. Baseline characteristics, blood samples, and angiography information were obtained. Major end points subsequent to first MI were assessed using landmark analyses to compare the rates of first events only where everyone with a prior history of any MACE before MI were censored and adjusted for follow-up times. Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses with age and sex forced into all models and additional covariates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by using the stepwise option for the selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One thousand two hundred fifty-one patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 3.4 years. Of these patients, 152 (12.2%) had T2MI during follow-up; T2MI was frequently recurrent. Multivariable predictors of T2MI were older age, lower systolic blood pressure, history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, nitrate use, and elevated concentrations of glucose, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, and cystatin C. Patients with T2MI had higher rates of subsequent adverse events than those without T2MI (per 100 person-years: MACE, 53.7 versus 21.1, <i>P</i><0.001; all-cause death, 23.3 versus 3.3, <i>P</i><0.001; cardiovascular death, 17.5 versus 2.6, <i>P</i><0.001; heart failure events, 22.4 versus 7.4, <i>P</i><0.001); these rates are similar to those seen in patients with type 1 MI. Incident diagnosis of T2MI strongly predicted risk for subsequent MACE (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–2.48; <i>P</i><0.001), all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 2.01–4.36; <i>P</i><0.001), and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–3.43; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>T2MI is common and associated with poor prognosis.

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Quality of Care at Hospitals Identified as Outliers in Publicly Reported Mortality Statistics for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public reporting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes may create disincentives for physicians to provide care for critically ill patients, particularly at institutions with worse clinical outcomes. We thus sought to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the procedural management and in-hospital outcomes of patients treated for acute myocardial infarction before and after a hospital had been publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a negative outlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using state reports, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed hospitals that were recognized as negative PCI outliers in 2 states (Massachusetts and New York) from 2002 to 2012. State hospitalization files were used to identify all patients with an acute myocardial infarction within these states. Procedural management and in-hospital outcomes were compared among patients treated at outlier hospitals before and after public report of outlier status. Patients at nonoutlier institutions were used to control for temporal trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 86 hospitals, 31 were reported as outliers for excess mortality. Outlier facilities were larger, treating more patients with acute myocardial infarction and performing more PCIs than nonoutlier hospitals (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). Among 507 672 patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at these institutions, 108 428 (21%) were treated at an outlier hospital after public report. The likelihood of PCI at outlier (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.15) and nonoutlier institutions (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11–1.14) increased in a similar fashion (interaction <i>P</i>=0.50) after public report of outlier status. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81–0.85) after public report, and to a lesser degree at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.92; interaction <i>P</i><0.001). Among patients that underwent PCI, in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">recognit</span></strong>ion of outlier status in comparison with prior (RR, 0.72; 9% CI, 0.66–0.79), a decline that exceeded the reduction at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96; interaction <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Large hospitals with higher clinical volume are more likely to be designated as negative outliers.

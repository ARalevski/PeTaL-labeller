Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels
<p>A wide variety of industrial applications require materials with high strength and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-strength, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity materials.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced em<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>ement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened alloys exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the deformed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole crystal. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e.</p>

Ultralarge elastic deformation of nanoscale diamond
<p>Diamonds have substantial hardness and durability, but attempting to deform diamonds usually results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e fracture. We demonstrate ultralarge, fully reversible elastic deformation of nanoscale (~300 nanometers) single-crystalline and polycrystalline diamond needles. For single-crystalline diamond, the maximum tensile strains (up to 9%) approached the theoretical elastic limit, and the corresponding maximum tensile stress reached ~89 to 98 gigapascals. After combining systematic computational simulations and characterization of pre- and postdeformation structural features, we ascribe the concurrent high strength and large elastic strain to the paucity of defects in the small-volume diamond nanoneedles and to the relatively smooth surfaces compared with those of microscale and larger specimens. The discovery offers the potential for new applications through optimized design of diamond nanostructure, geometry, elastic strains, and physical properties.</p>

Coherently aligned nanoparticles within a biogenic single crystal: A biological prestressing strategy
<p>In contrast to synthetic materials, materials produced by organisms are formed in ambient conditions and with a limited selection of elements. Nevertheless, living organisms reveal elegant strategies for achieving specific functions, ranging from skeletal support to mastication, from sensors and defensive tools to optical function. Using state-of-the-art characterization techniques, we present a biostrategy for strengthening and toughening the otherwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e calcite optical lenses found in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>estar <i>Ophiocoma wendtii</i>. This intriguing process uses coherent nanoprecipitates to induce compressive stresses on the host matrix, functionally resembling the Guinier–Preston zones known in classical metallurgy. We believe that these calcitic nanoparticles, being rich in magnesium, segregate during or just after transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase, similarly to segregation behavior from a supersaturated quenched alloy.</p>

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication
<p>Wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) is one of the founder crops that likely drove the Neolithic transition to sedentary agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Identifying genetic modifications underlying wheat’s domestication requires knowledge about the genome of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer (<i>T. turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccoides</i>). We report a 10.1-gigabase assembly of the 14 chromosomes of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, genome architecture, and genetic diversity. With this fully assembled polyploid wheat genome, we identified the causal mutations in <i>Brittle Rachis 1</i> (<i>TtBtr1</i>) genes controlling shattering, a key domestication trait. A study of genomic diversity among wild and domesticated accessions revealed genomic regions bearing the signature of selection under domestication. This reference assembly will serve as a resource for accelerating the genome-assisted improvement of modern wheat varieties.</p>

Combining polyethylene and polypropylene: Enhanced performance with PE/<i>i</i>PP multiblock polymers
<p>Polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (<i>i</i>PP) constitute nearly two-thirds of the world’s plastic. Despite their similar hydrocarbon makeup, the polymers are immiscible with one another. Thus, common grades of PE and <i>i</i>PP do not adhere or blend, creating challenges for recycling these materials. We synthesized PE/<i>i</i>PP multiblock copolymers using an isoselective alkene polymerization initiator. These polymers can weld common grades of commercial PE and <i>i</i>PP together, depending on the molecular weights and architecture of the block copolymers. Interfacial compatibilization of phase-separated PE and <i>i</i>PP with tetrablock copolymers enables morphological control, transforming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e materials into mechanically tough blends.</p>

Localized seismic deformation in the upper mantle revealed by dense seismic arrays
<p>Seismicity along continental transform faults is usually confined to the upper half of the crust, but the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), a major fault traversing the Los Angeles basin, is seismically active down to the upper mantle. We use seismic array analysis to illuminate the seismogenic root of the NIF beneath Long Beach, California, and identify seismicity in an actively deforming localized zone penetrating the lithospheric mantle. Deep earthquakes, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e fault zone matrix.</p>

Synthetic nacre by predesigned matrix-directed mineralization
<p>Although biomimetic designs are expected to play a key role in exploring future structural materials, facile fabrication of bulk biomimetic materials under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a mesoscale “assembly-and-mineralization” approach inspired by the natural process in mollusks to fabricate bulk synthetic nacre that highly resembles both the chemical composition and the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The millimeter-thick synthetic nacre consists of alternating organic layers and aragonite platelet layers (91 weight percent) and exhibits good ultimate strength and fracture toughness. This predesigned matrix-directed mineralization method represents a rational strategy for the preparation of robust composite materials with hierarchically ordered structures, where various constituents are adaptable, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e and heat-labile materials.</p>

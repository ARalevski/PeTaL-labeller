LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses six <i>LAZY</i> genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in roots and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to root and shoot branch angles and gravitropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary roots. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al in the gravitropism mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral root branch angle. Lateral roots of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary root axis, and they were agravitropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially agravitropic, but their phototropic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the root of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also agravitropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed gravitropic response. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed auxin gradient across the root visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of auxin gradients that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced auxin gradient.</p>

The influence of cartilage thickness at the sigmoid notch on inclination at the distal radioulnar joint
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were: firstly, to investigate the influence   of the thickness of cartilage at the sigmoid notch on the inclination   of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and secondly, to compare   the sensitivity and specificity of MRI with plain radiographs for   the assessment of the inclination of the articular surface of the   DRUJ in the coronal plane. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Contemporaneous MRI images and radiographs of 100 wrists from   98 asymptomatic patients (mean age 43 years, (16 to 67); 52 male,   53%) with no history of a fracture involving the wrist or surgery   to the wrist, were reviewed. The thickness of the cartilage at the   sigmoid notch, inclination of the DRUJ and Tolat Type of each DRUJ   were determined. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The assessment using MRI scans and cortical bone correlated well   with radiographs, with a kappa value of 0.83. The mean difference   between the inclination using the cortex and cartilage on MRI scans   was 12°, leading to a change of Tolat type of inclination in 66%   of wrists. No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e oblique (Type 3) inclinations were found when   using the cartilage to assess inclination. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>These data revealed that when measuring the inclination of the   DRUJ using cartilage, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e oblique inclinations might not exist.   The data suggest that performing an ulna shortening osteotomy might   be reasonable even in distal radioulnar joints where the plain radiographic   appearance suggests an unfavourable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e oblique inclination   in the coronal plane. We recommend using MRI to validate radiographs   in those that appear to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e oblique (Tolat Type 3), as the   true inclination might be different, thereby removing one possible   contraindication to ulnar shortening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:369–75.</p></sec>

Unexpected reversal of C<sub>3</sub> versus C<sub>4</sub> grass response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during a 20-year field experiment
<p>Theory predicts and evidence shows that plant species that use the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway (C<sub>4</sub> species) are less responsive to elevated carbon dioxide (<i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) than species that use only the C<sub>3</sub> pathway (C<sub>3</sub> species). We document a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al from this expected C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> contrast. Over the first 12 years of a 20-year free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment with 88 C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> grassland plots, we found that biomass was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>3</sub> but not C<sub>4</sub> plots, as expected.

Soil net nitrogen mineralization rates, an index of soil nitrogen supply, exhibited a similar shift: <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> first enhanced but later depressed rates in C<sub>3</sub> plots, with the opposite true in C<sub>4</sub> plots, partially explaining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al of the <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> biomass response. These findings challenge the current C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> paradigm and show that even the best-supported short-term drivers of plant response to global change might not predict long-term results.</p>

A primordial and reversible TCA cycle in a facultatively chemolithoautotrophic thermophile
<p>Inorganic carbon fixation is essential to sustain life on Earth, and the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle is one of the most ancient carbon fixation metabolisms. A combination of genomic, enzymatic, and metabolomic analyses of a deeply branching chemolithotrophic <i>Thermosulfidibacter takaii</i> ABI70S6<sup>T</sup> revealed a previously unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible TCA cycle whose direction was controlled by the available carbon source(s). Under a chemolithoautotrophic condition, a rTCA cycle occurred with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e reaction of citrate synthase (CS) and not with the adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent citrate cleavage reactions that had been regarded as essential for the conventional rTCA cycle. Phylometabolic evaluation suggests that the TCA cycle with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible CS may represent an ancestral mode of the rTCA cycle and raises the possibility of a facultatively chemolithomixotrophic origin of life.</p>

Physio-Genetic Dissection of Dark-Induced Leaf Senescence and Timing Its Reversal in Barley
<p>Barley crop model was analyzed for early and late events during the dark-induced leaf senescence (DILS) as well as for deciphering critical time limit for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al of the senescence process. Chlorophyll fluorescence vitality index Rfd was determined as the earliest parameter that correlated well with the cessation of photosynthesis prior to microautophagy symptoms, initiation of DNA degradation, and severalfold increase in the endonuclease <i>BNUC1.</i> DILS was found characterized by up-regulation of processes that enable recycling of degraded macromolecules and metabolites, including increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> remobilization, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and partial up-regulation of glyoxylate and tricarboxylate acid cycles. The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-affinity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin condensation, more DNA fragmentation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al of DILS by re-exposure of the plants from dark to light was possible until but not later than day 7 of dark exposure and was accompanied by regained photosynthesis, increase in chlorophyll, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al of Rfd, despite activation of macro-autophagy-related genes.</p>

Recovery from N Deprivation Is a Transcriptionally and Functionally Distinct State in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Facing adverse conditions such as nitrogen (N) deprivation, microalgae enter cellular quiescence, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible cell cycle arrest with drastic changes in metabolism allowing cells to remain viable. Recovering from N deprivation and quiescence is an active and orderly process as we are showing here for <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. We conducted comparative transcriptomics on this alga to discern processes relevant to quiescence in the context of N deprivation and recovery following refeeding. A mutant with slow recovery from N deprivation, <i>compromised hydrolysis of triacylglycerols7</i> (<i>cht7</i>), was included to better define the regulatory processes governing the respective transitions. We identified an ordered set of biological processes with expression patterns that showed sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al following N resupply and uncovered acclimation responses specific to the recovery phase. Biochemical assays and microscopy validated selected inferences made based on the transcriptional analyses. These comprise (1) the restoration of N source preference and cellular bioenergetics during the early stage of recovery; (2) flagellum-based motility in the mid to late stage of recovery; and (3) recovery phase-specific gene groups cooperating in the rapid replenishment of chloroplast proteins. In the <i>cht7</i> mutant, a large number of programmed responses failed to readjust in a timely manner. Finally, evidence is provided for the involvement of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway in gating the recovery. We conclude that the recovery from N deprivation represents not simply a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al of processes directly following N deprivation, but a distinct cellular state.</p>

Body Mass Index and Mortality Among Adults Undergoing Cardiac Surgery

A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.

Chronic TGF-β exposure drives stabilized EMT, tumor stemness, and cancer drug resistance with vulnerability to bitopic mTOR inhibition
<p>Tumors comprise cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their heterogeneous progeny within a stromal microenvironment. In response to transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β), epithelial and carcinoma cells undergo a partial or complete epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to cancer progression. This process is seen as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible because cells revert to an epithelial phenotype upon TGF-β removal. However, we found that prolonged TGF-β exposure, mimicking the state of in vivo carcinomas, promotes stable EMT in mammary epithelial and carcinoma cells, in contrast to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible EMT induced by a shorter exposure. The stabilized EMT was accompanied by stably enhanced stem cell generation and anticancer drug resistance. Furthermore, prolonged TGF-β exposure enhanced mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. A bitopic mTOR inhibitor repressed CSC generation, anchorage independence, cell survival, and chemoresistance and efficiently inhibited tumorigenesis in mice. These results reveal a role for mTOR in the stabilization of stemness and drug resistance of breast cancer cells and position mTOR inhibition as a treatment strategy to target CSCs.</p>

The transcription factor Lef1 switches partners from β-catenin to Smad3 during muscle stem cell quiescence
<p>Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, persist in adult mammals by entering a state of quiescence (G<sub>0</sub>) during the early postnatal period. Quiescence is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed during damage-induced regeneration and re-established after regeneration. Entry of cultured myoblasts into G<sub>0</sub> is associated with a specific, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible induction of Wnt target genes, thus implicating members of the Tcf and Lef1 (Tcf/Lef) transcription factor family, which mediate transcriptional responses to Wnt signaling, in the initiation of quiescence. We found that the canonical Wnt effector β-catenin, which cooperates with Tcf/Lef, was dispensable for myoblasts to enter quiescence. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches in cultured C2C12 myoblasts and in MuSCs, we demonstrated that Tcf/Lef activity during quiescence depended not on β-catenin but on the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) effector and transcriptional coactivator Smad3, which colocalized with Lef1 at canonical Wnt-responsive elements and directly interacted with Lef1 specifically in G<sub>0</sub>. Depletion of Smad3, but not β-catenin, reduced Lef1 occupancy at target promoters, Tcf/Lef target gene expression, and self-renewal of myoblasts. In vivo, MuSCs underwent a switch from β-catenin–Lef1 to Smad3-Lef1 interactions during the postnatal switch from proliferation to quiescence, with β-catenin–Lef1 interactions recurring during damage-induced reactivation. Our findings suggest that the interplay of Wnt-Tcf/Lef and TGF-β–Smad3 signaling activates canonical Wnt target promoters in a manner that depends on β-catenin during myoblast proliferation but is independent of β-catenin during MuSC quiescence.</p>

DDiT4L promotes autophagy and inhibits pathological cardiac hypertrophy in response to stress
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy, in response to stimuli such as exercise, is considered adaptive and beneficial. In contrast, pathological cardiac hypertrophy that arises in response to pathological stimuli such as unrestrained high blood pressure and oxidative or metabolic stress is maladaptive and may precede heart failure. We found that the transcript encoding DNA damage–inducible transcript 4-like (DDiT4L) was expressed in murine models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy but not in those of physiological cardiac hypertrophy. In cardiomyocytes, DDiT4L localized to early endosomes and promoted stress-induced autophagy through a process involving mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Exposing cardiomyocytes to various types of pathological stress increased the abundance of <i>DDiT4L</i>, which inhibited mTORC1 but activated mTORC2 signaling. Mice with conditional cardiac-specific overexpression of DDiT4L had mild systolic dysfunction, increased baseline autophagy, reduced mTORC1 activity, and increased mTORC2 activity, all of which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed by suppression of transgene expression. Genetic suppression of autophagy also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed cardiac dysfunction in these mice. Our data showed that DDiT4L may be an important transducer of pathological stress to autophagy through mTOR signaling in the heart and that DDiT4L could be therapeutically targeted in cardiovascular diseases in which autophagy and mTOR signaling play a major role.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p>Temperature-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient temperature during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits temperature-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a temperature at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

Protecting marine mammals, turtles, and birds by rebuilding global fisheries
<p>Reductions in global fishing pressure are needed to end overfishing of target species and maximize the value of fisheries.

We compare changes in fishing pressure needed to maximize profits from 4713 target fish stocks—accounting for >75% of global catch—to changes in fishing pressure needed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e ongoing declines of 20 marine mammal, sea turtle, and seabird populations threatened as bycatch. We project that maximizing fishery profits would halt or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e declines of approximately half of these threatened populations.

Improving commercial fishery management could thus yield important collateral benefits for threatened bycatch species globally.</p>

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility; for example, strengthening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased toughness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy network. The iron-containing network exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the network enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

In the context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to reduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to the device.

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient temperature regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown.

Increased rates of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a temperature sensor in plants.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible protein phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters protein function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human proteins may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating protein function—a protein with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. Proteins can be substrates for several protein kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single protein kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a protein kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic acid), which results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible or ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain vegetative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ion phenotypes such as bracts and vegetative inflorescence branches. Floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain vegetative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Discovery and Characterization of the 3-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase Component of the Plant Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Synthase System
<p>We report the characterization of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (mtHD) component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase (mtFAS) system, encoded by AT5G60335. The mitochondrial localization and catalytic capability of mtHD were demonstrated with a green fluorescent protein transgenesis experiment and by in vivo complementation and in vitro enzymatic assays. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown lines with reduced <i>mtHD</i> expression exhibit traits typically associated with mtFAS mutants, namely a miniaturized morphological appearance, reduced lipoylation of lipoylated proteins, and altered metabolomes consistent with the reduced catalytic activity of lipoylated enzymes. These alterations are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed when <i>mthd-rnai</i> mutant plants are grown in a 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, indicating the link between mtFAS and photorespiratory deficiency due to the reduced lipoylation of glycine decarboxylase. In vivo biochemical feeding experiments illustrate that sucrose and glycolate are the metabolic modulators that mediate the alterations in morphology and lipid accumulation. In addition, both <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants exhibit reduced accumulation of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (i.e. a hallmark of lipid A-like molecules) and abnormal chloroplastic starch granules; these changes are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible by the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, demonstrating two novel mtFAS functions that are independent of photorespiration. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants are nearly equivalent to each other in altering the transcriptome, and these analyses further identified genes whose expression is affected by a functional mtFAS system but independent of photorespiratory deficiency. These data demonstrate the nonredundant nature of the mtFAS system, which contributes unique lipid components needed to support plant cell structure and metabolism.</p>

The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Protease FtSH4 Is Involved in Leaf Senescence via Regulation of WRKY-Dependent Salicylic Acid Accumulation and Signaling
<p>Mitochondria and autophagy play important roles in the networks that regulate plant leaf senescence and cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between mitochondrial signaling and autophagy are currently not well understood. This study characterized the function of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mitochondrial AAA-protease gene <i>FtSH4</i> in regulating autophagy and senescence, finding that FtSH4 mediates WRKY-dependent salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and signaling. Knockout of <i>FtSH4</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant resulted in severe leaf senescence, cell death, and high autophagy levels. The level of SA increased dramatically in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant. Expression of <i>nahG</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant led to decreased SA levels and suppressed the leaf senescence and cell death phenotypes. The transcript levels of several SA synthesis and signaling genes, including <i>SALICYLIC ACID</i> <i>INDUCTION DEFICIENT2</i> (<i>SID2</i>), <i>NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1</i> (<i>NDR1</i>), and <i>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), increased significantly in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants compared with the wild type. Loss of function of <i>SID2</i>, <i>NDR1</i>, or <i>NPR1</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed the <i>ftsh4-4</i> senescence and autophagy phenotypes. Furthermore, <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants had elevated levels of transcripts of several <i>WRKY</i> genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, <i>WRKY46</i>, <i>WRKY51</i>, <i>WRKY60</i>, <i>WRKY63</i>, and <i>WRKY75</i>; all of these WRKY proteins can bind to the promoter of <i>SID2</i>. Loss of function of <i>WRKY75</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants decreased the levels of SA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed the senescence phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease FtSH4 may regulate the expression of <i>WRKY</i> genes by modifying the level of reactive oxygen species and the WRKY transcription factors that control SA synthesis and signaling in autophagy and senescence.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect genes than large-effect genes, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast gene expression traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e genetics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

Melanocortin 1 Receptor Signaling Regulates Cholesterol Transport in Macrophages
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1-R) is expressed by monocytes and macrophages, where it exerts anti-inflammatory actions on stimulation with its natural ligand α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone. The present study was designed to investigate the specific role of MC1-R in the context of atherosclerosis and possible regulatory pathways of MC1-R beyond anti-inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Human and mouse atherosclerotic samples and primary mouse macrophages were used to study the regulatory functions of MC1-R. The impact of pharmacological MC1-R activation on atherosclerosis was assessed in apolipoprotein E–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Characterization of human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques revealed that MC1-R expression localizes in lesional macrophages and is significantly associated with the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, which are responsible for initiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e cholesterol transport. Using bone marrow–derived macrophages, we observed that α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone and selective MC1-R agonists similarly promoted cholesterol efflux, which is a counterregulatory mechanism against foam cell formation. Mechanistically, MC1-R activation upregulated the levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in cell surface CD36 expression and in cholesterol uptake, further protecting macrophages from excessive lipid accumulation. Conversely, macrophages deficient in functional MC1-R displayed a phenotype with impaired efflux and enhanced uptake of cholesterol. Pharmacological targeting of MC1-R in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E–deficient mice reduced plasma cholesterol levels and aortic CD36 expression and increased plaque ABCG1 expression and signs of plaque stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify a novel role for MC1-R in macrophage cholesterol transport.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways.

<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> VOZ (Vascular plant One-Zinc finger) transcription factors are required for proper regulation of flowering time
<p>Transition to flowering in plants is tightly controlled by environmental cues, which regulate the photoperiod and vernalization pathways, and endogenous signals, which mediate the autonomous and gibberellin pathways. In this work, we investigated the role of two Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger transcription factors, the paralogues AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2, in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> flowering. Single <i>atvoz1-1</i> and <i>atvoz2-1</i> mutants showed no significant phenotypes as compared to wild type. However, <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> double mutant plants exhibited several phenotypes characteristic of flowering-time mutants. The double mutant displayed a severe delay in flowering, together with additional pleiotropic phenotypes. Late flowering correlated with elevated expression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>), which encodes a potent floral repressor, and decreased expression of its target, the floral promoter <i>FD</i>. Vernalization rescued delayed flowering of <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed elevated <i>FLC</i> levels. Accumulation of <i>FLC</i> transcripts in <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> correlated with increased expression of several <i>FLC</i> activators, including components of the PAF1 and SWR1 chromatin-modifying complexes. Additionally, AtVOZs were shown to bind the promoter of <i>MOS3/SAR3</i> and directly regulate expression of this nuclear pore protein, which is known to participate in the regulation of flowering time, suggesting that AtVOZs exert at least some of their flowering regulation by influencing the nuclear pore function. Complementation of <i>atvoz1-1 atvoz2-1</i> with AtVOZ2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed all double mutant phenotypes, confirming that the observed morphological and molecular changes arise from the absence of functional AtVOZ proteins, and validating the functional redundancy between AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy release and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ibly bind different types of lipid molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospholipid transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the lipid transfer protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular lipid composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and lipid-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

An Oxalyl-CoA Synthetase Is Involved in Oxalate Degradation and Aluminum Tolerance
<p>Acyl Activating Enzyme3 (AAE3) was identified to be involved in the catabolism of oxalate, which is critical for seed development and defense against fungal pathogens. However, the role of AAE3 protein in abiotic stress responses is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of rice bean (<i>Vigna umbellata</i>) VuAAE3 in Al tolerance. Recombinant VuAAE3 protein has specific activity against oxalate, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 121 ± 8.2 µ<sc>m</sc> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 7.7 ± 0.88 µmol min<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup> protein, indicating it functions as an oxalyl-CoA synthetase. VuAAE3-GFP localization suggested that this enzyme is a soluble protein with no specific subcellular localization. Quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e transcription-PCR and <i>VuAAE3</i> promoter-GUS reporter analysis showed that the expression induction of <i>VuAAE3</i> is mainly confined to rice bean root tips. Accumulation of oxalate was induced rapidly by Al stress in rice bean root tips, and exogenous application of oxalate resulted in the inhibition of root elongation and <i>VuAAE3</i> expression induction, suggesting that oxalate accumulation is involved in Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, overexpression of VuAAE3 in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) resulted in the increase of Al tolerance, which was associated with the decrease of oxalate accumulation. In addition, <i>NtMATE</i> and <i>NtALS3</i> expression showed no difference between transgenic lines and wild-type plants. Taken together, our results suggest that VuAAE3-dependent turnover of oxalate plays a critical role in Al tolerance mechanisms.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Light-Harvesting Antennae and State Transition in <i>chlorina</i> and cpSRP Mutants
<p>State transitions in photosynthesis provide for the dynamic allocation of a mobile fraction of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to photosystem II (PSII) in state I and to photosystem I (PSI) in state II. In the state I-to-state II transition, LHCII is phosphorylated by STN7 and associates with PSI to favor absorption cross-section of PSI. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with defects in chlorophyll (Chl) b biosynthesis or in the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) machinery to study the flexible formation of PS-LHC supercomplexes. Intriguingly, we found that impaired Chl b biosynthesis in <i>chlorina1-2</i> (<i>ch1-2</i>) led to preferentially stabilized LHCI rather than LHCII, while the contents of both LHCI and LHCII were equally depressed in the cpSRP43-deficient mutant (<i>chaos</i>). In view of recent findings on the modified state transitions in LHCI-deficient mutants (Benson et al., 2015), the <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants were used to assess the influence of varying LHCI/LHCII antenna size on state transitions. Under state II conditions, LHCII-PSI supercomplexes were not formed in both <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> plants. LHCII phosphorylation was drastically reduced in <i>ch1-2</i>, and the inactivation of STN7 correlates with the lack of state transitions. In contrast, phosphorylated LHCII in <i>chaos</i> was observed to be exclusively associated with PSII complexes, indicating a lack of mobile LHCII in <i>chaos</i>. Thus, the comparative analysis of <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants provides new evidence for the flexible organization of LHCs and enhances our understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible allocation of LHCII to the two photosystems.</p>

NAD Acts as an Integral Regulator of Multiple Defense Layers
<p>Pyridine nucleotides, such as NAD, are crucial redox carriers and have emerged as important signaling molecules in stress responses. Previously, we have demonstrated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that the inducible NAD-overproducing <i>nadC</i> lines are more resistant to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst-AvrRpm1</i>), which was associated with salicylic acid-dependent defense. Here, we have further characterized the NAD-dependent immune response in Arabidopsis. Quinolinate-induced stimulation of intracellular NAD in transgenic <i>nadC</i> plants enhanced resistance against a diverse range of (a)virulent pathogens, including <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>, <i>Dickeya dadantii</i>, and <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Characterization of the redox status demonstrated that elevated NAD levels induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the expression of redox marker genes of the cytosol and mitochondrion. Using pharmacological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e genetics approaches, we show that NAD-induced ROS production functions independently of NADPH oxidase activity and light metabolism but depends on mitochondrial respiration, which was increased at higher NAD. We further demonstrate that NAD primes pathogen-induced callose deposition and cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals that NAD simultaneously induces different defense hormones and that the NAD-induced metabolic profiles are similar to those of defense-expressing plants after treatment with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. We thus conclude that NAD triggers metabolic profiles rather similar to that of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and discuss how signaling cross talk between defense hormones, ROS, and NAD explains the observed resistance to pathogens.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>e transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>al, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative mortality compared   with cementless THA.

No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than controls. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that cementation of the   femoral component was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a cemented acetabular component combined with a cementless   femoral component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving cemented THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early mortality that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">revers</span></strong>ed from day 15 and thereafter.

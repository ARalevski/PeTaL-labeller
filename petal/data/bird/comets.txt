Observations of Ejecta Clouds Produced by Impacts onto Saturn’s Rings
<sec><title>Saturn's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteoroid</span></strong> Crash</title><p>During Saturn's equinox in 2009, when the Sun illuminated its rings edge-on, images taken by the Cassini spacecraft showed dust clouds appearing as bright streaks above the rings. Similar streaks were detected in 2005 and 2012 when Cassini observed the C ring at close range. <bold>Tiscareno <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 460) suggest that the cause of each observed feature is likely to be the impact of a stream of recently disrupted material originating from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteoroid</span></strong> impact onto the ring and derive the influx rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteoroid</span></strong>s at Saturn.</p></sec>

Xenon isotopes in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko show that comets contributed to Earth's atmosphere
<p>The origin of cometary matter and the potential contribution of comets to inner-planet atmospheres are long-standing problems. During a series of dedicated low-altitude orbits, the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) on the Rosetta spacecraft analyzed the isotopes of xenon in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coma</span></strong> of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The xenon isotopic composition shows deficits in heavy xenon isotopes and matches that of a primordial atmospheric component. The present-day Earth atmosphere contains 22 ± 5% cometary xenon, in addition to chondritic (or solar) xenon.</p>

Do naked mole rats accumulate a metabolic acidosis or an oxygen debt in severe hypoxia?
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Naked mole rats enter into a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coma</span></strong>-like state upon reoxygenation following severe hypoxia but do not pay off an oxygen debt.</p>

Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Improves Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac surgery is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular and other complications that translate into increased mortality and healthcare costs. This retrospective study was designed to determine whether the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of complications and mortality after cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 1134 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery and coronary artery bypass surgery plus valvular or other procedures were included. Of them, 568 received intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion and 566 did not. Data were adjusted with propensity scores, and multivariate logistic regression was used. The primary outcomes measured included mortality and postoperative major adverse cardiocerebral events (stroke, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coma</span></strong>, perioperative myocardial infarction, heart block, or cardiac arrest). Secondary outcomes included renal failure, sepsis, delirium, postoperative ventilation hours, length of hospital stay, and 30-day readmission. Dexmedetomidine use significantly reduced postoperative in-hospital (1.23% versus 4.59%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.192–0.614; <i>P</i><0.0001), 30-day (1.76% versus 5.12%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.226–0.655; <i>P</i><0.0001), and 1-year (3.17% versus 7.95%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.312–0.701; <i>P</i>=0.0002) mortality. Perioperative dexmedetomidine therapy also reduced the risk of overall complications (47.18% versus 54.06%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.0136) and delirium (5.46% versus 7.42%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.75; <i>P</i>=0.0030).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>Perioperative dexmedetomidine use was associated with a decrease in postoperative mortality up to 1 year and decreased incidence of postoperative complications and delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration—</title><p>URL: <ext-link>www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ase domain. Because ATP allosterically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, consistent with ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating guanylyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of transmembrane guanylyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ases.</p>

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple steroid ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation or inhibition of MR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, we studied the response to eight steroids (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by the steroids, and others required higher steroid concentrations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these steroids had little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Analysis of Posttranslational Activation of Alternative Oxidase Isoforms
<p>Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) in plants is a non-proton-motive ubiquinol oxidase that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. A comparative analysis of the AOX isoenzymes AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) revealed that cysteine residues, CysI and CysII, are both involved in 2-oxo acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, with AOX1A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity being more increased by 2-oxo acids than that of AOX1C and AOX1D. Substitution of cysteine in AOX1A by glutamate mimicked its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by pyruvate or glyoxylate, but not in AOX1C and AOX1D. CysIII, only present in AOX1A, is not involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by reduction or metabolites, but substitutions at this position affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. AOX1A carrying a serine residue at position CysI was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by succinate, while correspondingly substituted variants of AOX1C and AOX1D were insensitive. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by glutamate at CysI and CysII is consistent with the formation of the thiohemiacetal, while succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation after changing CysI to serine suggests hemiacetal formation. Surprisingly, in AOX1A, replacement of CysI by alanine, which cannot form a (thio)hemiacetal, led to even higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities, pointing to an alternative mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AOX isoforms are differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation at CysI and CysII is additive.</p>

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production
<p>Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated PLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation–dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) production, or PKD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.</p>

The tyrosine kinase Src promotes phosphorylation of the kinase TBK1 to facilitate type I interferon production after viral infection
<p>Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in response to viral infection to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the production of type I interferons (IFNs). However, central to the responses of all of these receptors is their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the kinase TBK1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates transcription by IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We investigated the mechanism by which the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of TBK1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated in response to viral infection. We found that the tyrosine kinase Src promoted the phosphorylation of TBK1 on Tyr<sup>179</sup> upon viral infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. Mutation of Tyr<sup>179</sup> to alanine resulted in impaired autophosphorylation of TBK1 at Ser<sup>172</sup>, which is required for TBK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. The TBK1 Y179A mutant failed to rescue type I IFN production by virally infected RAW264.7 macrophages deficient in TBK1. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with AZD0530 and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9–mediated knockout of Src demonstrated that Src was critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating type I IFN production. However, Src did not directly bind to recombinant TBK1 in vitro but instead bound to the proline-X-X-proline motifs within key PRR adaptor proteins, such as TRIF, MAVS, and STING, which formed complexes with TBK1 after PRR engagement. Together, our data suggest that Src is the major tyrosine kinase that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prime</span></strong>s TBK1 for autophosphorylation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, thus providing mechanistic insights into the regulation of TBK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by various PRRs as part of the innate antiviral response.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates JNK upon Rok <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that controls osteoclast activity and bone mass in vivo
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts is essential for bone homeostasis. The kinase Src promotes osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in osteoclasts by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. In other contexts, however, PTPROt can inhibit Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that PTPROt is bifunctional and can dephosphorylate Src both at its inhibitory residue Tyr<sup>527</sup> and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating residue Tyr<sup>416</sup>. Whereas wild-type and PTPROt knockout mice exhibited similar bone masses, mice in which a putative C-terminal phosphorylation site, Tyr<sup>399</sup>, in endogenous PTPROt was replaced with phenylalanine had increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Osteoclasts from the knock-in mice also showed reduced Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Experiments in cultured cells and in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains demonstrated that the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>399</sup> caused PTPROt to dephosphorylate Src at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating site pTyr<sup>416</sup>. In contrast, phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> enabled PTPROt to recruit Src through Grb2 and to dephosphorylate Src at the inhibitory site Tyr<sup>527</sup>, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. We conclude that reversible phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that selects between its opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities toward Src and maintains a coherent signaling output, and that blocking this phosphorylation event can induce physiological effects in vivo. Because most receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases contain potential phosphorylation sites at their C termini, we propose that preventing phosphorylation at these sites or its consequences may offer an alternative to inhibiting their catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity to achieve therapeutic benefit.</p>

A molecular assembly phase transition and kinetic proofreading modulate Ras activation by SOS
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (SOS) is a key Ras <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator that is autoinhibited in the cytosol and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates upon membrane recruitment. Autoinhibition release involves structural rearrangements of the protein at the membrane and thus introduces a delay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al recruitment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. In this study, we designed a single-molecule assay to resolve the time between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al receptor-mediated membrane recruitment and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of individual SOS molecules on microarrays of Ras-functionalized supported membranes. The rise-and-fall shape of the measured SOS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation time distribution and the long mean time scale to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation (~50 seconds) establish a basis for kinetic proofreading in the receptor-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Ras. We further demonstrate that this kinetic proofreading is modulated by the LAT (linker for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of T cells)–Grb2–SOS phosphotyrosine-driven phase transition at the membrane.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate synapse formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

TGF-β promotes PI3K-AKT signaling and prostate cancer cell migration through the TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation of p85α
<p>Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) is a pluripotent cytokine that regulates cell fate and plasticity in normal tissues and tumors. The multifunctional cellular responses evoked by TGF-β are mediated by the canonical SMAD pathway and by noncanonical pathways, including mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. We found that TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated PI3K in a manner dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 polyubiquitylated the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α and promoted the formation of a complex between the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and p85α, which led to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K and AKT. Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked polyubiquitylation of p85α on Lys<sup>513</sup> and Lys<sup>519</sup> in the iSH2 (inter–Src homology 2) domain was required for TGF-β–induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K-AKT signaling and cell motility in prostate cancer cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated macrophages. Unlike the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of SMAD pathways, the TRAF6-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K and AKT was not dependent on the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of TβRI. In situ proximity ligation assays revealed that polyubiquitylation of p85α was evident in aggressive prostate cancer tissues. Thus, our data reveal a molecular mechanism by which TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates the PI3K-AKT pathway to drive cell migration.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptor signaling to induce NK cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated immune cells.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity as well as through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

Loss and Gain of Human Acidic Mammalian Chitinase Activity by Nonsynonymous SNPs
<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is implicated in asthma, allergic inflammation, and food processing. Little is known about genetic and evolutional regulation of chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of AMCase. Here, we relate human AMCase polymorphisms to the mouse AMCase, and show that the highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e variants encoded by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are consistent with the mouse AMCase sequence. The chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the recombinant human AMCase was significantly lower than that of the mouse counterpart. By creating mouse-human chimeric AMCase protein we found that the presence of the N-terminal region of human AMCase containing conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e site residues reduced the enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the molecule. We were able to significantly increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of human AMCase by amino acid substitutions encoded by nsSNPs (N45, D47, and R61) with those conserved in the mouse homologue (D45, N47, and M61). For abolition of the mouse AMCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, introduction of M61R mutation was sufficient. M61 is conserved in most of primates other than human and orangutan as well as in other mammals. Orangutan has I61 substitution, which also markedly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the mouse AMCase, indicating that the M61 is a crucial residue for the chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Altogether, our data suggest that human AMCase has lost its chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by integration of nsSNPs during evolution and that the enzyme can be re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by introducing amino acids conserved in the mouse counterpart.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>i were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ical stretch (3 h at 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es per minute) increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ally presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al VF/VT and 1063 with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse effects were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs. Together the findings may signal a clinical benefit that invites further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) links energy sensing to anti-inflammatory signaling
<p>Adenosine 5′-monophosphate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (AMPK) is a pivotal regulator of metabolism at cellular and organismal levels. AMPK also suppresses inflammation. We found that pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of AMPK rapidly inhibited the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of transcription (STAT) pathway in various cells. In vitro kinase assays revealed that AMPK directly phosphorylated two residues (Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup>) within the Src homology 2 domain of JAK1. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of AMPK enhanced the interaction between JAK1 and 14-3-3 proteins in cultured vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, an effect that required the presence of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> and was abolished in cells lacking AMPK catalytic subunits. Mutation of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> abolished AMPK-mediated inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by either the sIL-6Rα/IL-6 complex or the expression of a constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e V658F-mutant JAK1 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Clinically used AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators metformin and salicylate enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of endogenous JAK1 and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in primary vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, our findings reveal a mechanism by which JAK1 function and inflammatory signaling may be suppressed in response to metabolic stress and provide a mechanistic rationale for the investigation of AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators in a range of diseases associated with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the JAK-STAT pathway.</p>

IFN-γ–inducible antiviral responses require ULK1-mediated activation of MLK3 and ERK5

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e, further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity.

Targeting nucleotide exchange to inhibit constitutively active G protein α subunits in cancer cells
<p>Constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e G protein α subunits cause cancer, cholera, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other disorders. Therapeutic intervention by targeted inhibition of constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα subunits in these disorders has yet to be achieved. We found that constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub> in uveal melanoma (UM) cells was inhibited by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR).

Allosteric inhibition of other Gα subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-binding site. In UM cells driven by constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub>, FR inhibited second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated apoptosis.

The development of FR analogs specific for other Gα subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα subunits or multiple G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) where targeting a single receptor is ineffective.</p>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity generates phasic contractions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Pacemaker currents are generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) in the plasma membrane. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Blocking CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying current with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated current (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>). An inhibitory peptide that interfered with the STIM-Orai interaction blocked <i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub> in HEK 293 cells expressing STIM1 and Orai1 and blocked spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) and slow wave currents in ICC. STICs, which are fundamental pacemaker events in ICC, were blocked by an Orai antagonist. Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients linked to pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in ICC in intact muscles showed that the Orai antagonist blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery through STIM-Orai interactions is necessary to maintain ICC pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity.</p>

RGS proteins are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity R4 subfamily and found that these altered proteins exhibited reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity R4 subfamily RGS protein increased its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for specific Gα proteins.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino acids that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate the sweet taste receptor. In addition to inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation, <sc>d</sc>-amino acids derived from <i>Staphylococcus</i> inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating T1R2/3. <sc>d</sc>-Amino acid–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the presence of the bitter receptor–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating compound denatonium benzoate.

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p>Acidic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly acidic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate PhoP in mildly acidic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate PhoP under mildly acidic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to acidic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly acidic pH, PhoP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

Membrane depolarization activates BK channels through ROCK-mediated β1 subunit surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction
<p>Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to vasoconstriction. Membrane depolarization also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity that promotes vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα channels.

De novo phosphorylation and conformational opening of the tyrosine kinase Lck act in concert to initiate T cell receptor signaling
<p>The enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the Src family tyrosine kinase p56<sup>Lck</sup> (Lck) is tightly controlled by differential phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues, Tyr<sup>394</sup> and Tyr<sup>505</sup>. Phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> and the conformational opening of Lck are believed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate the kinase, whereas Tyr<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation is thought to generate a closed, in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e conformation of Lck. We investigated whether the conformation of Lck and its phosphorylation state act in concert to regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. With a sensitive biosensor, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to investigate the conformations of wild-type Lck and its phosphorylation-deficient mutants Y394F and Y505F and the double mutant Y394F/Y505F in un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated T cells and after TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. With this approach, we separated the conformational changes of Lck from the phosphorylation state of its regulatory tyrosines. We showed that the conformational opening of Lck alone was insufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate signaling events in T cells. Rather, Lck additionally required phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> to induce T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Consistent with the FLIM measurements, an optimized immunofluorescence microscopy protocol revealed that the TCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr<sup>394</sup> occurred preferentially at the plasma membrane of Jurkat cells and primary human T cells. Our study supports the hypothesis that T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation through the TCR complex is accompanied by the de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Lck and that phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> plays a role in Lck function that goes beyond inducing an open conformation of the kinase.</p>

Functional degradation: A mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation by diverse pathogen enzymes
<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate innate immunity by recruitment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of caspase-1. The NLRP1B inflammasome is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated upon direct cleavage by the anthrax lethal toxin protease. However, the mechanism by which cleavage results in NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation is unknown. In this study, we find that cleavage results in proteasome-mediated degradation of the amino-terminal domains of NLRP1B, liberating a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is a potent caspase-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NLRP1B is both necessary and sufficient for NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation.

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, or interaction partners. However, how this SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity concentrates the proteins involved and the substrates into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the requirements for SUMO NB formation and for their subsequent colocalization with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a master regulator of plant growth. COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity results in degradation of transcription factors, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prime</span></strong>s the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity alone was sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 docks in the substrate-binding pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.</p>

Co-activation of microRNAs by Zelda is essential for early <i>Drosophila</i> development
<p>Transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two important classes of <i>trans</i>-regulators in differential gene expression. Transcription factors occupy <i>cis</i>-regulatory motifs in DNA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate or repress gene transcription, whereas miRNAs specifically pair with seed sites in target mRNAs to trigger mRNA decay or inhibit translation. Dynamic spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors and miRNAs during development point to their stage- and tissue-specific functions. Recent studies have focused on miRNA functions during development; however, much remains to explore regarding how the expression of miRNAs is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated and how dynamic miRNA expression patterns are achieved by transcriptional regulatory networks at different developmental stages. Here, we focused on the identification, regulation and function of miRNAs during the earliest stage of <i>Drosophila</i> development, when the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) takes place. Eleven miRNA clusters comprise the first set of miRNAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in the blastoderm embryo. The transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator Zelda is required for their proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and regulation, and Zelda binding observed in genome-wide binding profiles is predictive of enhancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In addition, other blastoderm transcription factors, comprising both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators and repressors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities of which are potentiated and coordinated by Zelda, contribute to the accurate temporal and spatial expression of these miRNAs, which are known to function in diverse developmental processes. Although previous genetic studies showed no early phenotypes upon loss of individual miRNAs, our analysis of the <i>miR-1; miR-9a</i> double mutant revealed defects in gastrulation, demonstrating the importance of co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of miRNAs by Zelda during the MZT.</p>

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines.

Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation.

Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs.

Transcriptional activation of elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor by corticosteroids, progesterone, and spironolactone
<p>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a nuclear receptor and part of a large and diverse family of transcription factors that also includes receptors for glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, and estrogens. The corticosteroid aldosterone is the physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of the MR in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates; however, its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator is not known in cartilaginous fish, the oldest group of extant jawed vertebrates.

On the basis of their measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone, and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fish. Although progesterone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates MRs in ray-finned fish, progesterone does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate MRs in humans, amphibians, or alligator, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate the MR.

Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular transformation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven transformation required the GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SOS2 and was restored in <i>Sos2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> MEFs by expression of constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>SOS2</i> reduced EGF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the transformed phenotype of human <i>KRAS</i> mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven transformation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Biased signaling by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor–specific antibodies determines thyrocyte survival in autoimmunity
<p>The thyroid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor (GPCR). Autoimmune hyperthyroidism, commonly known as Graves’ disease (GD), is caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating autoantibodies to the TSHR. We previously described TSHR-specific antibodies (TSHR-Abs) in GD that recognize linear epitopes in the cleavage region of the TSHR ectodomain (C-TSHR-Abs) and induce thyroid cell apoptosis instead of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating the TSHR. We found that C-TSHR-Abs entered the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis but did not trigger endosomal maturation and failed to undergo normal vesicular sorting and trafficking. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating TSHR-Abs (S-TSHR-Abs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Gα<sub>s</sub> and, to a lesser extent, Gα<sub>q</sub> but that C-TSHR-Abs failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate any of the G proteins normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in response to TSH. Furthermore, specific inhibition of G proteins in the presence of S-TSHR-mAbs or TSH resulted in a similar failure of endosomal maturation as that caused by C-TSHR-mAbs. Hence, whereas S-TSHR-mAbs and TSH contributed to normal vesicular trafficking of TSHR through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of major G proteins, the C-TSHR-Abs resulted in GRK2- and β-arrestin-1–dependent biased signaling, which is interpreted as a danger signal by the cell. Our observations suggest that the binding of antibodies to different TSHR epitopes may decrease cell survival. Antibody-induced cell injury and the response to cell death amplify the loss of self-tolerance, which most likely helps to perpetuate GPCR-mediated autoimmunity.</p>

Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells
<p>The retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological processes. To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation sequence–green fluorescent protein (UAS-GFP) reporter mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. Reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity increased during granulocyte colony-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating factor (G-CSF)–induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)–induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Gal4-UAS reporter cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA ligands. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand that was greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together, these data suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in the immunological synapse.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two cells and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the T cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Lysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging
<p>In the adult brain, the neural stem cell (NSC) pool comprises quiescent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated populations with distinct roles. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that quiescent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated NSCs exhibited differences in their protein homeostasis network. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated NSCs had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e proteasomes, quiescent NSCs contained large lysosomes. Quiescent NSCs from young mice accumulated protein aggregates, and many of these aggregates were stored in large lysosomes.

During aging, quiescent NSCs displayed defects in their lysosomes, increased accumulation of protein aggregates, and reduced ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate.

The MAPK Kinase Kinase GmMEKK1 Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses
<p>MAPK signaling pathways play critical roles in plant immunity. Here, we silenced multiple genes encoding MAPKs using virus-induced gene silencing mediated by <i>Bean pod mottle virus</i> to identify MAPK genes involved in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) immunity. Surprisingly, a strong hypersensitive response (HR) cell death was observed when soybean <i>MAPK KINASE KINASE1</i> (<i>GmMEKK1</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>MEKK1</i>, was silenced. The HR was accompanied by the overaccumulation of defense signaling molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide. Genes involved in primary metabolism, translation/transcription, photosynthesis, and growth/development were down-regulated in <i>GmMEKK1-</i>silenced plants, while the expression of defense-related genes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated. Accordingly, <i>GmMEKK1</i>-silenced plants were more resistant to downy mildew (<i>Peronospora manshurica</i>) and <i>Soybean mosaic virus</i> compared with control plants. Silencing <i>GmMEKK1</i> reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of GmMPK6 but enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of <i>Gm</i>MPK3 in response to flg22 peptide. Unlike Arabidopsis MPK4, <i>Gm</i>MPK4 was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by either flg22 or SA. Interestingly, transient overexpression of <i>GmMEKK1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> also induced HR. Our results indicate that <i>Gm</i>MEKK1 plays both positive and negative roles in immunity and appears to differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate downstream MPKs by promoting <i>Gm</i>MPK6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation but suppressing GmMPK3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in response to flg22. The involvement of <i>Gm</i>MPK4 kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in cell death and in flg22- or SA-triggered defense responses in soybean requires further investigation.</p>

AIK1, A Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Modulates Abscisic Acid Responses through the MKK5-MPK6 Kinase Cascade<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module involved in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus for appropriate cellular adjustment. This cascade essentially consists of three components: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK, connected to each other by the event of phosphorylation. Here, we report the characterization of a MAPKKK, ABA-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (AIK1), which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). T-DNA insertion mutants of AIK1 showed insensitivity to ABA in terms of both root growth and stomatal response. AIK1 functions in ABA responses via regulation of root cell division and elongation, as well as stomatal responses. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of AIK1 is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>), and the Arabidopsis protein phosphatase type 2C, ABI1, a negative regulator of ABA signaling, restricts AIK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by dephosphorylation. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis showed that MPK3, MPK6, and AIK1 interact with MKK5. The single mutant seedlings of <i>mpk6</i> and <i>mkk5</i> have similar phenotypes to <i>aik1</i>, but <i>mkk4</i> does not. AIK1 was localized in the cytoplasm and shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate MKK5 by protein phosphorylation, which was an ABA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated process. Constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e MKK5 in <i>aik1</i> mutant seedlings complements the ABA-insensitive root growth phenotype of <i>aik1</i>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of MPK6 was increased by ABA in wild-type seedlings, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by ABA was impaired in <i>aik1</i> and <i>aik1 mkk5</i> mutants. These findings clearly suggest that the AIK1-MKK5-MPK6 cascade functions in the ABA regulation of primary root growth and stomatal response.</p>

The intracellular pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase NT5C3A is a negative epigenetic factor in interferon and cytokine signaling
<p>The enzyme pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase (NT5C3A), which mediates nucleotide catabolism, was previously thought to be restricted to blood cells. We showed that expression of the gene encoding NT5C3A was induced by type I interferons (IFNs) in multiple cell types and that NT5C3A suppressed cytokine production through inhibition of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. <i>NT5C3A</i> expression required both an intronic IFN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated response element and the IFN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated transcription factor IRF1. Overexpression of NT5C3A, but not of its catalytic mutants, suppressed IL-8 production by HEK293 cells. Whereas knockdown of <i>NT5C3A</i> enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated IL-8 production, it reduced the IFN-mediated suppression of <i>Il8</i> expression. Overexpression of <i>NT5C3A</i> increased the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup> and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6, which are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylases.

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ATM by DNA damage from that by oxidative stress using separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of checkpoint responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation.

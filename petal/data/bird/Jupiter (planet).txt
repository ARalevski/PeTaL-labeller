Juno observations of spot structures and a split tail in Io-induced aurorae on Jupiter
<p>Jupiter’s aurorae are produced in its upper atmosphere when incoming high-energy electrons precipitate along the planet’s magnetic field lines. A northern and a southern main auroral oval are visible, surrounded by small emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n features associated with the Galilean moons. We present infrared observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns, obtained with the Juno spacecraft, showing that in the case of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>, this emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n exhibits a swirling pattern that is similar in appearance to a von Kéèèárméèèáán vortex street. Well downstream of the main auroral spots, the extended tail is split in two. Both of Ganymede’s footprints also appear as a pair of emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n features, which may provide a remote measure of Ganymede’s magnetosphere. These features suggest that the magnetohydrodynamic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n between Jupiter and its moon is more complex than prev<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>usly anticipated.</p>

Resistance to DNA damage and enhanced DNA repair capacity in the hypoxia-tolerant blind mole rat <i>Spalax carmeli</i>
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> The cells of the blind mole rat <i>Spalax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carm</span></strong>eli</i> show enhanced DNA repair capacity and resistance to several genotoxic agents, which may contribute to its longevity and reduced cancer rates.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s constantly accumulate damage caused by visible wavelengths of light during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Our previous study revealed that entire photodamaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells damaged by high visible light displayed abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s persisted, and dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> due to high visible light-derived envelope damage results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the lipid droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting lipid droplets within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> of the micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>, but there have been debates on the localization of the lipid droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of lipid droplets in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of lipid droplets within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma, even though some lipid droplets existed in close association with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> or were largely engulfed by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. These lipid droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> lipid droplets are likely to be embedded within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> to the lipid droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s import many preproteins that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> preproteins contains all the information required for import into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membranes for proteins containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble proteins through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein translocation into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. The mistargeting of TMD-containing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> proteins affect protein translocation through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing proteins.</p>

Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s develop from undifferentiated proplastids present in meristematic tissue. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the transition from proplastids to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct phases. The first phase is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second phase is dependent on the activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the transition to photosynthetically functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. The second phase also is associated with a spatial transition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is a two-phase process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory phase allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and plastid genomes.</p>

The Rubisco Chaperone BSD2 May Regulate Chloroplast Coverage in Maize Bundle Sheath Cells
<p>In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), Bundle Sheath Defective2 (BSD2) plays an essential role in Rubisco biogenesis and is required for correct bundle sheath (BS) cell differentiation. Yet, BSD2 RNA and protein levels are similar in mesophyll (M) and BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, although Rubisco accumulates only in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. This raises the possibility of additional BSD2 roles in cell development. To test this hypothesis, transgenic lines were created that overexpress and underexpress BSD2 in both BS and M cells, driven by the cell type-specific Rubisco Small Subunit (RBCS) or Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC) promoters or the ubiquitin promoter. Genetic crosses showed that each of the transgenes could complement Rubisco deficiency and seedling lethality conferred by the <i>bsd2</i> mutation. This was unexpected, as RBCS-BSD2 lines lacked BSD2 in M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and PEPC-BSD2 lines expressed half the wild-type BSD2 level in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. We conclude that BSD2 does not play a vital role in M cells and that BS BSD2 is in excess of requirements for Rubisco accumulation. BSD2 levels did affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage in BS cells. In PEPC-BSD2 lines, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage decreased 30% to 50%, whereas lines with increased BSD2 content exhibited a 25% increase. This suggests that BSD2 has an ancillary role in BS cells related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> size. Gas exchange showed decreased photosynthetic rates in PEPC-BSD2 lines despite restored Rubisco function, correlating with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage and pointing to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion changes. Conversely, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage did not result in increased Rubisco abundance or photosynthetic rates. This suggests another limitation beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> volume, most likely Rubisco biogenesis and/or turnover rates.</p>

ARSENATE INDUCED CHLOROSIS 1/ TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 132 Protects Chloroplasts from Arsenic Toxicity
<p>Arsenic (As) is highly toxic to plants and detoxified primarily through complexation with phytochelatins (PCs) and other thiol compounds. To understand the mechanisms of As toxicity and detoxification beyond PCs, we isolated an arsenate-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>arsenate induced chlorosis1</i> (<i>aic1</i>), in the background of the PC synthase-defective mutant <i>cadmium-sensitive1-3</i> (<i>cad1-3</i>). Under arsenate stress, <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> showed larger decreases in chlorophyll content and the number and size of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s than <i>cad1-3</i> and a severely distorted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> structure. The <i>aic1</i> single mutant also was more sensitive to arsenate than the wild type (Columbia-0). As concentrations in the roots, shoots, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s were similar between <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> and <i>cad1-3</i>. Using genome resequencing and complementation, <i>TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>132</i> (<i>TOC132</i>) was identified as the mutant gene, which encodes a translocon protein involved in the import of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Proteomic analysis showed that the proteome of <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s was more affected by arsenate stress than that of <i>cad1-3</i>. A number of proteins related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ribosomes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, compound synthesis, and thioredoxin systems were less abundant in <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> than in <i>cad1-3</i> under arsenate stress. Our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s are a sensitive target of As toxicity and that AIC1/Toc132 plays an important role in protecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s from As toxicity.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ribosomes, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and various ribosomal proteins. Genes for many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ribosomal proteins, as well as proteins with auxiliary roles in ribosome biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of proteins, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ribosomal proteins. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS protein comigrates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ribosomal particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ribosomal proteins, particularly the plastid ribosomal proteins of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multiprotein/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ribosome that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

Structure-Function Analysis of Chloroplast Proteins via Random Mutagenesis Using Error-Prone PCR
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> genes was developed three decades ago and has greatly advanced the field of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s research. Here, we describe a new approach for generating random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> gene mutants that combines error-prone polymerase chain reaction of a gene of interest with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> complementation of the knockout <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant. As a proof of concept, we targeted a 300-bp sequence of the <i>petD</i> gene that encodes subunit IV of the thylakoid membrane-bound cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex. By sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> transformants, we revealed 149 mutations in the 300-bp target <i>petD</i> sequence that resulted in 92 amino acid substitutions in the 100-residue target subunit IV sequence. Our results show that this method is suited to the study of highly hydrophobic, multisubunit, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-encoded proteins containing cofactors such as hemes, iron-sulfur clusters, and chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s. Moreover, we show that mutant screening and sequencing can be used to study photosynthetic mechanisms or to probe the mutational robustness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-encoded proteins, and we propose that this method is a valuable tool for the directed evolution of enzymes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>.</p>

Chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluxes into and across Thylakoids Revealed by Thylakoid-Targeted Aequorin Probes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s require a fine-tuned control of their internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is crucial for many aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-localized processes. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium regulation within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s also may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in the cytosol. To investigate the involvement of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and in the modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, we targeted the bioluminescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin as a YFP fusion to the lumen and the stromal surface of thylakoids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the dark, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid lumen were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid lumen) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique kinetic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid lumen. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, mirroring transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for dark-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-dark-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and plant cells.</p>

Light Acclimation of the Colonial Green Alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> Strain Showa

To investigate differences between single cellular and colonial species, we studied the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and photoprotection during photoacclimation for the colonial green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> and made a comparison with the properties of the single cellular species <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. We show that <i>B. braunii</i> shares some high-light (HL) photoacclimation strategies with <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and other frequently studied green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e: decreased chlorophyll content, increased free carotenoid content, and increased nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Additionally, <i>B. braunii</i> has unique HL photoacclimation strategies, related to its colonial form: strong internal shading by an increase of the colony size and the accumulation of extracellular echinenone (a ketocarotenoid). HL colonies are larger and more spatially heterogenous than low-light colonies. Compared with surface cells, cells deeper inside the colony have increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation and larger photosystem II antenna size. The core of the largest of the HL colonies does not contain living cells. In contrast with <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, but similar to other biofilm-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, NPQ capacity is substantial in low light. In HL, NPQ amplitude increases, but kinetics are unchanged. We discuss possible causes of the different acclimation responses of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and <i>B. braunii</i>. Knowledge of the specific photoacclimation processes for this colonial green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> further extends the view of the diversity of photoacclimation strategies in photosynthetic organisms.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> accumulation response in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and biomass production.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s are multifunctional organelles whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid membranes has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand RNA ((+)RNA) virus, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) to observe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> structural changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membranes, characterized by the clustering of outer membrane-invaginated spherules in inner membrane-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of cytoplasmic invaginations (CIs) were evident with spherules at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the cytoplasm.

The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and played a prominent role in eliciting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membrane rearrangements.

Balance between Cytosolic and Chloroplast Translation Affects Leaf Variegation
<p>The development of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s relies on the fine coordination of expressions of both nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> genomes. We have been using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>yellow variegated</i> (<i>var2</i>) leaf variegation mutant as a tool to dissect the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. In this work, we screened for <i>var2</i> genetic enhancer modifiers termed <i>enhancer of variegation</i> (<i>evr</i>) mutants and report the characterization of the first <i>EVR</i> locus, <i>EVR1</i>. We showed that <i>EVR1</i> encodes the cytosolic 80S ribosome 40S small subunit protein RPS21B and the loss of <i>EVR1</i> causes the enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation. We further demonstrated that combined S21 activities from EVR1 and its close homolog, EVR1L1, are essential for Arabidopsis, and they act redundantly in regulating leaf development and <i>var2</i> leaf variegation. Moreover, using additional cytosolic ribosomal protein mutants, we showed that although mutations in cytosolic ribosomal proteins all enhance <i>var2</i> leaf variegation to varying degrees, the 40S subunit appears to have a more profound role over the 60S subunit in regulating VAR2-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. Comprehensive genetic analyses with <i>var2</i> suppressors that are defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation established that the enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation by cytosolic ribosomal protein mutants is dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation. Based on our data, we propose a model that incorporates the suppression and enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation, and hypothesize that VAR2/AtFtsH2 may be intimately involved in the balancing of cytosolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation programs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s performed by cotyledons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s are profoundly different, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic phosphate levels, oscillations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic reductant supply.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty acids are synthesized in the stroma of plant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s by the fatty acid synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty acids are then used to generate plastidial lipids that are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in the model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty acid synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> quality control system.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of protein integration into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membranes. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely independent of SEC2. FTSH12 was integrated into the envelope membrane in a coupled import-integration reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 integrated into the envelope in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely integrates a subset of inner envelope membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the plastid genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> as the site for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought resistance. In this study, we show that two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased resistance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and drought resistant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic proteins could be a way for improving drought resistance in crops.</p>

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of melanin increases skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. Melanin production depends on the pH of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the pH of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, which is more active at basic pH.

Holliday junction resolvases mediate chloroplast nucleoid segregation

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> and mitochondrial genomes are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> RECA2 on mitochondrial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome instability.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

To begin dissecting the molecular changes that led to the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in this group, the complementary DNAs encoding four distinct β-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms were characterized from leaf tissue of <i>Neurachne munroi</i> (C<sub>4</sub>), <i>Neurachne minor</i> (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>), and <i>Neurachne alopecuroidea</i> (C<sub>3</sub>). Two genes (<i>CA1</i> and <i>CA2</i>) each encode two different isoforms: CA1a/CA1b and CA2a/CA2b. Transcript analyses found that <i>CA1</i> messenger RNAs were significantly more abundant than transcripts from the <i>CA2</i> gene in the leaves of each species examined, constituting ∼99% of all β-CA transcripts measured. Localization experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs showed that, while CA1b is a cytosolic CA in all three species, the CA1a proteins are differentially localized. The <i>N. alopecuroidea</i> and <i>N. minor</i> CA1a isoforms were imported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf cells, whereas <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a localized to the cytosol.

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s.

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are significant sexual differences in the morphological and physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder under stressful conditions. However, little is known about sex-specific differences in responses to nutrient deficiencies. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies on the morphological, physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ultrastructural traits of <i>P. cathayana</i> males and females were investigated. The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both sexes. Males had higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s than did females when exposed to N- and P-deficiency conditions. Nitrogen-deficient males had higher glutamate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities, and a more intact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ultrastructure, but less starch accumulation than did N-deficient females. Phosphorus-deficient males had higher nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and acid phosphatase activities, but a lower foliar N : P ratio and less PSII damage than did P-deficient females. These results suggest that N and P deficiencies cause greater negative effects on females than on males, and that the different sexes of <i>P. cathayana</i> may employ different strategies to cope with N and P deficiencies.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and transported into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is transported into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport sulfate across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respiration. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respiration is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

Coordination of Chloroplast Development through the Action of the GNC and GLK Transcription Factor Families
<p>Fundamental questions regarding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s develop from proplastids remain poorly understood despite their central importance to plant life. Two families of nuclear transcription factors, the GATA NITRATE-INDUCIBLE CARBON-METABOLISM-INVOLVED (GNC) and GOLDEN TWO-LIKE (GLK) families, have been implicated in directly and positively regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. Here, we determined the degree of functional overlap between the two transcription factor families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), characterizing their ability to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis both alone and in concert. We determined the DNA-binding motifs for GNC and GLK2 using protein-binding microarrays; the enrichment of these motifs in transcriptome datasets indicates that GNC and GLK2 are repressors and activators of gene expression, respectively. ChIP-seq analysis of GNC identified <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR</i> and brassinosteroid activity genes as targets whose repression by GNC facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis. In addition, GNC targets and represses genes involved in ERECTA signaling and thereby facilitates stomatal development. Our results define key regulatory features of the GNC and GLK transcription factor families that contribute to the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis and photosynthetic activity, including areas of independence and cross talk.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and lipid synthesis controlled by lipid signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by wind. The ability of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to respond rapidly to these variations in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

Light and Plastid Signals Regulate Different Sets of Genes in the Albino Mutant Pap7-1
<p>Plants possessing dysfunctional plastids due to defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> biosynthesis or translation are known to repress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-associated nuclear genes via retrograde signals from the disturbed organelles toward the nucleus. These signals are thought to be essential for proper biogenesis and function of the plastid. Mutants lacking plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) display a genetic arrest in eoplast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> transition leading to an albino phenotype in the light. Retrograde signaling in these mutants, therefore, could be expected to be similar as under conditions inducing plastid dysfunction. To answer this question, we performed plastome- and genomewide array analyses in the <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In parallel, we determined the potential overlap with light-regulated expression networks. To this end, we performed a comparative expression profiling approach using light- and dark-grown wild-type plants as relative control for the expression profiles obtained from light-grown <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants. Our data indicate a specific impact of retrograde signals on metabolism-related genes in <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants reflecting the starvation situation of the albino seedlings. In contrast, light regulation of PhANGs and other nuclear gene groups appears to be fully functional in this mutant, indicating that a block in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis per se does not repress expression of them as suggested by earlier studies. Only genes for light harvesting complex proteins displayed a significant repression indicating an exclusive retrograde impact on this gene family. Our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and arrested plastids each emit specific signals that control different target gene modules both in positive and negative manner.</p>

Photosynthetic Trichomes Contain a Specific Rubisco with a Modified pH-Dependent Activity
<p>Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is the most abundant enzyme in plants and is responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. This enzyme is assembled from eight large subunits (RbcL) encoded by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> gene and eight small subunits (RbcS) encoded by a nuclear gene family. Rubisco is primarily found in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s of mesophyll (C3 plants), bundle-sheath (C4 plants), and guard cells. In certain species, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s also takes place in the secretory cells of glandular trichomes, which are epidermal outgrowths (hairs) involved in the secretion of specialized metabolites. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and, in particular, Rubisco have not been characterized in trichomes. Here, we show that tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) trichomes contain a specific Rubisco small subunit, NtRbcS-T, which belongs to an uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster (T). This cluster contains RbcS from at least 33 species, including monocots, many of which are known to possess glandular trichomes. Cluster T is distinct from the cluster M, which includes the abundant, functionally characterized RbcS isoforms expressed in mesophyll or bundle-sheath cells. Expression of NtRbcS-T in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and purification of the full Rubisco complex showed that this isoform conferred higher <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values as well as higher acidic pH-dependent activity than NtRbcS-M, an isoform expressed in the mesophyll. This observation was confirmed with trichome extracts. These data show that an ancient divergence allowed for the emergence of a so-far-uncharacterized RbcS cluster. We propose that secretory trichomes have a particular Rubisco uniquely adapted to secretory cells where CO<sub>2</sub> is released by the active specialized metabolism.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong></i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Carbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Photosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation mechanisms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> that can grow using various carbon sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Like other photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where carbon supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the carbon availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the carbon-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative mechanisms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the carbon availability.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are defective in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

The Photosystem II Repair Cycle Requires FtsH Turnover through the EngA GTPase
<p>Specific degradation of photodamaged D1, the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein, is a crucial step in the PSII repair cycle to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s activity. Processive proteolysis by the FtsH protease is fundamental to cooperative D1 degradation. Here, we attempted to purify the FtsH complex to elucidate its regulation mechanisms and substrate recognition in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Unlike previously reported prokaryotic and mitochondrial FtsHs, the Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic FtsH does not appear to form a megacomplex with prohibition-like proteins but instead accumulates as smaller complexes. The copurified fraction was enriched with a partial PSII intermediate presumably undergoing repair, although its precise properties were not fully clarified. In addition, we copurified a bacteria-type GTPase localized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, EngA, and confirmed its interaction with FtsH by subsequent pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. While the <i>engA</i> mutation is embryo lethal, the transgenic lines overexpressing EngA (EngA-OX) showed leaf variegation reminiscent of the variegated mutant lacking FtsH2. EngA-OX was revealed to accumulate more cleaved D1 fragments and reactive oxygen species than the wild type, indicative of compromised PSII repair. Based on these results and the fact that FtsH becomes more stable in EngA-OX, we propose that EngA negatively regulates FtsH stability. We demonstrate that proper FtsH turnover is crucial for PSII repair in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis. Consistent with the increased turnover of FtsH under high-light conditions in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, our findings underline the rapid turnover of not only D1 but also FtsH proteases in the PSII repair cycle.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

The proposed central regulator of plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), is present at very low levels, which has hampered the discovery of its precise molecular function. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN1 protein accumulates to detectable levels only at very early stages of leaf development, where it functions in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis. <i>GUN1</i> mRNA is present at high levels in all tissues, but GUN1 protein undergoes rapid degradation (with an estimated half-life of ∼4 h) in all tissues where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis has been completed. The rapid turnover of GUN1 is controlled mainly by the chaperone ClpC1, suggesting degradation of GUN1 by the Clp protease. Degradation of GUN1 slows under stress conditions that alter retrograde signaling, thus ensuring that the plant has sufficient GUN1 protein. We also find that the pentatricopeptide repeat motifs of GUN1 are important determinants of GUN1 stability. Moreover, overexpression of <i>GUN1</i> causes an early flowering phenotype, suggesting a function of GUN1 in developmental phase transitions beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the regulation of GUN1 by proteolytic degradation, uncover its function in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis, and suggest a role in developmental phase transitions.</p>

Temporal Proteomics of Inducible RNAi Lines of Clp Protease Subunits Identifies Putative Protease Substrates
<p>The Clp protease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s of plant cells is a large complex composed of at least 13 nucleus-encoded subunits and one plastid-encoded subunit, which are arranged in several ring-like structures. The proteolytic P-ring and the structurally similar R-ring form the core complex that contains the proteolytic chamber. Chaperones of the HSP100 family help with substrate unfolding, and additional accessory proteins are believed to assist with Clp complex assembly and/or to promote complex stability. Although the structure and function of the Clp protease have been studied in great detail in both bacteria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, the identification of bona fide protease substrates has been very challenging. Knockout mutants of genes for protease subunits are of limited value, due to their often pleiotropic phenotypes and the difficulties with distinguishing primary effects (i.e. overaccumulation of proteins that represent genuine protease substrates) from secondary effects (proteins overaccumulating for other reasons). Here, we have developed a new strategy for the identification of candidate substrates of plant proteases. By combining ethanol-inducible knockdown of protease subunits with time-resolved analysis of changes in the proteome, proteins that respond immediately to reduced protease activity can be identified. In this way, secondary effects are minimized and putative protease substrates can be identified. We have applied this strategy to the Clp protease complex of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and identified a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> proteins that are likely degraded by Clp. These include several metabolic enzymes but also a small number of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s.</p>

The DEAD-box RNA Helicase RH50 Is a 23S-4.5S rRNA Maturation Factor that Functionally Overlaps with the Plastid Signaling Factor GUN1
<p>DEAD-box RNA helicases (DBRHs) modulate RNA secondary structure, allowing RNA molecules to adopt the conformations required for interaction with their target proteins. RH50 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-located DBRH that colocalizes and is coexpressed with GUN1, a central factor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-to-nucleus signaling. When combined with mutations that impair plastid gene expression (<i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prpl11</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps21</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps17</i>-<i>1</i>, and <i>prpl24</i>-<i>1</i>), <i>rh50</i> and <i>gun1</i> mutations evoke similar patterns of epistatic effects. These observations, together with the synergistic growth phenotype of the double mutant <i>rh50</i>-<i>1 gun1</i>-<i>102</i>, suggest that RH50 and GUN1 are functionally related and that this function is associated with plastid gene expression, in particular ribosome functioning. However, <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> itself is not a gun mutant, although—like <i>gun1</i>-<i>102—</i>the <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> mutation suppresses the down-regulation of nuclear genes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s induced by the <i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i> mutation. The RH50 protein comigrates with ribosomal particles, and is required for efficient translation of plastid proteins. RH50 binds to transcripts of the 23S-4.5S intergenic region and, in its absence, levels of the corresponding rRNA processing intermediate are strongly increased, implying that RH50 is required for the maturation of the 23S and 4.5S rRNAs. This inference is supported by the finding that loss of RH50 renders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> protein synthesis sensitive to erythromycin and exposure to cold. Based on these results, we conclude that RH50 is a plastid rRNA maturation factor.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e and a direct means to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

The DnaJ-Like Zinc-Finger Protein HCF222 Is Required for Thylakoid Membrane Biogenesis in Plants
<p>To understand the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane in higher plants and to identify auxiliary proteins required to build up this highly complex membrane system, we have characterized the allelic nuclear mutants <i>high chlorophyll fluorescence222-1</i> (<i>hcf222-1</i>) and <i>hcf222-2</i> and isolated the causal gene by map-based cloning. In the ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant <i>hcf222-1</i>, the accumulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> (Cytb6f) complex was reduced to 30% compared with the wild type. Other thylakoid membrane complexes accumulated to normal levels. The T-DNA knockout mutant <i>hcf222-2</i> showed a more severe defect with respect to thylakoid membrane proteins and accumulated only 10% of the Cytb6f complex, accompanied by a reduction in photosystem II, the photosystem II light-harvesting complex, and photosystem I. <i>HCF222</i> encodes a protein of 99 amino acids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that has similarities to the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ chaperones. The insulin precipitation assay demonstrated that HCF222 has disulfide reductase activity in vitro. The protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e and cyanobacteria. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that a fraction of HCF222-green fluorescent protein was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum but that it also could be recognized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. A fusion construct of HCF222 containing a plastid transit peptide targets the protein into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and was able to complement the mutational defect. These findings indicate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-targeted HCF222 is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the Cytb6f complex and is very likely involved in thiol-disulfide biochemistry at the thylakoid membrane.</p>

pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development
<p>Regulation of photosynthetic gene expression by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. The activity of PEP largely relies on at least 12 PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome of plant cells. A recent model proposed that these PAPs regulate the establishment of the PEP complex through broad PAP-PEP or PAP-PAP interactions. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedling-lethal mutant <i>ptac10-1</i>, which has defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development, and found that the mutant phenotype is caused by the suppression of <i>PLASTID S1 RNA-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN</i> (<i>pTAC10/PAP3</i>). Analysis of the heterozygous mutant and <i>pTAC10</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants indicated that the expression level of <i>pTAC10</i> is tightly linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. Characterization of the interaction of pTAC10 with PAPs revealed that pTAC10 interacts with other PAPs, such as FSD2, FSD3, TrxZ, pTAC7, and pTAC14, but it does not interact with PEP core enzymes, such as rpoA and rpoB. Analysis of pTAC10 interactions using truncated pTAC10 proteins showed that the pTAC10 carboxyl-terminal region downstream of the S1 domain is involved in the pTAC10-PAP interaction. Furthermore, overexpression of truncated <i>pTAC10s</i> lacking the C-terminal regions downstream of the S1 domain could not rescue the <i>ptac10-1</i> mutant phenotype and induced an abnormal whitening phenotype in Columbia-0 plants. Our observations suggested that these pTAC10-PAP interactions are essential for the formation of the PEP complex and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development.</p>

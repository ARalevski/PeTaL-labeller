Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides. In addition to stimulating further study, these results may have immediate relevance for guideline committees, laboratory leadership, clinicians, and patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline collection and the average of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>tation, and/or >60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar.

Reconfigurable system for automated optimization of diverse chemical reactions
<p>Chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s generally requires labor-intensive, sometimes tedious trial-and-error <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization of reaction conditions. Here, we describe a plug-and-play, continuous-flow chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s system that mitigates this challenge with an integrated combination of hardware, software, and analytics. The system software controls the user-selected reagents and unit operations (reactors and separators), processes reaction analytics (high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy), and conducts automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izations. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated in high-yielding implementations of C-C and C-N cross-coupling, olefination, reductive amination, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>Ar), photoredox catalysis, and a multistep sequence. The graphical user interface enables users to initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izations, monitor progress remotely, and analyze results. Subsequent users of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ized procedure need only download an electronic file, comparable to a smartphone application, to implement the protocol on their own apparatus.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating stroke risk; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating bleeding risks.

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

We report here the development of an automated flow-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s platform, designed from commercially available components, that integrates both rapid nanomole-scale reaction screening and micromole-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s into a single modular unit. This system was validated by exploring a diverse range of reaction variables in a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling on nanomole scale at elevated temperatures, generating liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data points for 5760 reactions at a rate of >1500 reactions per 24 hours. Through multiple injections of the same segment, the system directly produced micromole quantities of desired material. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al conditions were also replicated in traditional flow and batch mode at 50- to 200-milligram scale to provide good to excellent yields.</p>

NIH quietly shelves gun research program

Ravens parallel great apes in flexible planning for tool-use and bartering
<p>The ability to flexibly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong> for events outside of the current sensory scope is at the core of being human and is crucial to our everyday lives and society.

Here, we show that ravens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong> for events unrelated to caching—tool-use and bartering—with delays of up to 17 hours, exert self-control, and consider temporal distance to future events. Their performance parallels that seen in apes and suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ning evolved independently in corvids, which opens new avenues for the study of cognitive evolution.</p>

GTPase activity–coupled treadmilling of the bacterial tubulin FtsZ organizes septal cell wall synthesis
<p>The bacterial tubulin FtsZ is the central component of the cell division machinery, coordinating an ensemble of proteins involved in septal cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s to ensure successful constriction. How cells achieve this coordination is unknown. We found that in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells, FtsZ exhibits dynamic treadmilling predominantly determined by its guanosine triphosphatase activity. The treadmilling dynamics direct the processive movement of the septal cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s machinery but do not limit the rate of septal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. In FtsZ mutants with severely reduced treadmilling, the spatial distribution of septal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and the molecular composition and ultrastructure of the septal cell wall were substantially altered. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling provides a mechanism for achieving uniform septal cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s to enable correct polar morphology.</p>

A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tailor</span></strong>ed nanographenes directly on the rutile titania surface. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting surfaces.</p>

Mapping the dark space of chemical reactions with extended nanomole synthesis and MALDI-TOF MS
<p>Understanding the practical limitations of chemical reactions is critically important for efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of compounds in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and specialty chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> and development.

We herein illustrate strategies for carrying out large-scale surveys of chemical reactivity by using a material-sparing nanomole-scale automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s platform with greatly expanded synthetic scope combined with ultrahigh-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).</p>

Quantum physics could get big boost from U.S. Congress
<p>U.S. officials are backing an emerging effort to better organize and boost funding for quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong>, which could reshape computing, sensors, and communications. In the coming weeks, the science committee of the House of Representatives is expected to introduce legislation calling for a new, 10-year-long National Quantum Initiative. The White House and science agencies are also calling for a larger role for the federal government in quantum science. A yearlong push by a coalition of academic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong>ers and technology firms helped trigger this flurry of activity. Proponents argue that the United States needs a better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong> for harvesting the potential fruits of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong>—and for keeping up with global competitors.</p>

Compacted dimensions and singular plasmonic surfaces
<p>In advanced field theories, there can be more than four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions to space, the excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions described as compacted and unobservable on everyday length scales. We report a simple model, unconnected to field theory, for a compacted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ion realized in a metallic metasurface periodically structured in the form of a grating comprising a series of singularities. An extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ion of the grating is hidden, and the surface plasmon excitations, though localized at the surface, are characterized by three wave vectors rather than the two of typical two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional metal grating.

Human-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking
<p>Exoskeletons and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.</p>

The extent of forest in dryland biomes
<p>Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their forest area is poorly known. Here, we report an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of global forest extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate is 40 to 47% higher than previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before.

Synthesis of resveratrol tetramers via a stereoconvergent radical equilibrium

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tailor</span></strong>ed oil crops.</p>

Suboptimal Acclimation of Photosynthesis to Light in Wheat Canopies<sup>[CC-BY]</sup>
<p>Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional architecture of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al distribution of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al light-saturated rate of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al light-saturated rate of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong>, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al GCN from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated.</p>

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to samples from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury. Here, we examined the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells. Last, we performed aptamer-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry to technically verify aptamer specificity for a subset of the new biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale aptamer multiplexing at a level that has not previously been reported and with sample throughput that greatly exceeds other existing proteomic methods.

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure remains significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term survival is not well understood. We hypothesized that an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P survival exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion Trial public data set was used. Trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>tation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of TFS to S2P. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The risk-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors. In patients with multiple risk factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few risk factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS.

In persons with SBP <160 mm Hg, CAC stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0.

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast development and starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the development of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in developing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development.

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus formation. Mutants defective in cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus formation, indicating that de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus formation. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus formation. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus formation.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants
<p>The secondary cell walls of tracheary elements and fibers are rich in cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich secondary cell walls, but their bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> (<i>CESA</i>) gene families of mosses and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts diversified independently, <i>CESA</i> knockout analysis in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in CESA functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>ze primary and secondary cell walls, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of <i>ppcesa3/8</i> knockouts provided negative controls for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type <i>P. patens</i>. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in which the deposition of aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion; (2) Automatic Hedge-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ted crop species.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, genomes of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative genomics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume genomes as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these genomes and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated genomic fractionation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further genomics exploration in the legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative genomics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed Legume Comparative Genomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have been found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression system via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ally selected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> the small RNA overexpression system. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this system, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through designing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this system could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpression system could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, heat stress, and recovery from heat stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>zed during heat stress and recovery from heat stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong>ers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>izes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>ize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">research</span></strong> groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution

While this method provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e allele frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of selection signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of selection targets, we propose a new approach that re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s selected haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify selected haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that selected haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a selected haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events.

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesi</span></strong>s, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optim</span></strong>al. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ions   were manually created. The re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ions were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This information can be used in the surgical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ning   and operative re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a fracture of the proximal humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the REDUCTION protocol, 3D CT re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-fold reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated ED compared with C-CT,   the REDUCTION protocol reduces the amount of CT radiation substantially   without significant diagnostic decay. It produces images that appear   to be comparable with those of C-CT for evaluating fractures of   the limbs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1668-73.</p></sec>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

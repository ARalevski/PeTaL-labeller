Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation, creating a positive albedo–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change–induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation on nitrogen loading.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-strength aluminum alloys are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-strength aluminum alloys require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of solute clusters. This results in better material strength and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate-free zones. These alloys are therefore likely to be more resistant to damage.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> magnetic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferromagnetic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A laser is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in lasers with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a laser has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in fiber lasers can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles. Multimode fiber lasers thus open new directions in studies of nonlinear wave propagation and capabilities for applications.</p>

Loss of a mammalian circular RNA locus causes miRNA deregulation and affects brain function
<p>Hundreds of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant in the mammalian brain, often with conserved expression. Here we show that the circRNA Cdr1as is massively bound by the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-7 and miR-671 in human and mouse brains. When the <i>Cdr1as</i> locus was removed from the mouse genome, knockout animals displayed impaired sensorimotor gating—a deficit in the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> out unnecessary information—which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological recordings revealed dysfunctional synaptic transmission. Expression of miR-7 and miR-671 was specifically and posttranscriptionally misregulated in all brain regions analyzed. Expression of immediate early genes such as <i>Fos</i>, a direct miR-7 target, was enhanced in <i>Cdr1as</i>-deficient brains, providing a possible molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. Our data indicate an in vivo loss-of-function circRNA phenotype and suggest that interactions between Cdr1as and miRNAs are important for normal brain function.</p>

A human-driven decline in global burned area
<p>Fire is an essential Earth system process that alters ecosystem and atmospheric composition. Here we assessed long-term fire trends using multiple satellite data sets. We found that global burned area declined by 24.3 ± 8.8% over the past 18 years. The estimated decrease in burned area remained robust after adjusting for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation variability and was largest in savannas. Agricultural expansion and intensification were primary drivers of declining fire activity. Fewer and smaller fires reduced aerosol concentrations, modified vegetation structure, and increased the magnitude of the terrestrial carbon sink. Fire models were unable to reproduce the pattern and magnitude of observed declines, suggesting that they may overestimate fire emissions in future projections. Using economic and demographic variables, we developed a conceptual model for predicting fire in human-dominated landscapes.</p>

Biological control of aragonite formation in stony corals
<p>Little is known about how stony corals build their calcareous skeletons. There are two prevailing hypotheses: that it is a physicochemically dominated process and that it is a biologically mediated one. Using a combination of ultrahigh-resolution three<i>-</i>dimensional imaging and two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that mineral deposition is biologically driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid mineral phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation of aragonite.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric forcing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

Aggregation of the Whi3 protein, not loss of heterochromatin, causes sterility in old yeast cells
<p>In yeast, heterochromatin silencing is reported to decline in aging mother cells, causing sterility in old cells. This process is thought to reflect a decrease in the activity of the NAD<sup>+ </sup>(oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–dependent deacetylase Sir2. We tested whether Sir2 becomes nonfunctional gradually or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ously during aging. Unexpectedly, silencing of the heterochromatic <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> loci was not lost during aging. Old cells could initiate a mating response; however, they were less sensitive to mating pheromone than were young cells because of age-dependent aggregation of Whi3, an RNA-binding protein controlling S-phase entry. Removing the polyglutamine domain of Whi3 restored the pheromone sensitivity of old cells. We propose that aging phenotypes previously attributed to loss of heterochromatin silencing are instead caused by aggregation of the Whi3 cell cycle regulator.</p>

Climate change: The 2015 Paris Agreement thresholds and Mediterranean basin ecosystems
<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement of December 2015 aims to maintain the global average warming well below 2°C above the preindustrial level. In the Mediterranean basin, recent pollen-based reconstructions of climate and ecosystem variability over the past 10,000 years provide insights regarding the implications of warming thresholds for biodiversity and land-use potential. We compare scenarios of climate-driven future change in land ecosystems with reconstructed ecosystem dynamics during the past 10,000 years. Only a 1.5°C warming scenario permits ecosystems to remain within the Holocene variability. At or above 2°C of warming, climatic change will generate Mediterranean land ecosystem changes that are unmatched in the Holocene, a period characterized by recurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation deficits rather than temperature anomalies.</p>

Cool by neuronal decision

Astoundingly, this change in activity can alter the body's core temperature. Cellular and molecular details of the warm and cold sensitivity of these neurons are not well understood. Although the induction of fever has been well studied, the mechanisms that terminate fever are not yet clear. On page 1393 of this issue, Song <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report that a transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>) is key to the function of these neurons in thermoregulation, particularly in response to fever.</p>

Differential Roles of the Thylakoid Lumenal Deg Protease Homologs in Chloroplast Proteostasis<xref><sup>,2</sup></xref>
<p>Deg proteases are involved in protein quality control in prokaryotes. Of the three Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs, Deg1, Deg5, and Deg8, located in the thylakoid lumen, Deg1 forms a homohexamer, whereas Deg5 and Deg8 form a heterocomplex. Both Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 were shown separately to degrade photosynthetic proteins during photoinhibition. To investigate whether Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 are redundant, a full set of Arabidopsis <i>Deg</i> knockout mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared. Under all conditions tested, <i>deg1</i> mutants were affected more than the wild type and <i>deg5</i> and <i>deg8</i> mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Deg5-Deg8 could only partially compensate for the loss of Deg1. Comparative proteomics of <i>deg1</i> mutants revealed moderate up-regulation of thylakoid proteins involved in photoprotection, assembly, repair, and housekeeping and down-regulation of those that form photosynthetic complexes. Quantification of protein levels in the wild type revealed that Deg1 was 2-fold more abundant than Deg5-Deg8. Moreover, recombinant Deg1 displayed higher in vitro proteolytic activity. Affinity enrichment assays revealed that Deg1 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ated with very few interacting proteins, whereas Deg5-Deg8 was associated with a number of thylakoid proteins, including D1, OECs, LHCBs, Cyt <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i>, and NDH subunits, thus implying that Deg5-Deg8 is capable of binding substrates but is unable to degrade them efficiently. This work suggests that differences in protein abundance and proteolytic activity underlie the differential importance of Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 protease complexes observed in vivo.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

The DnaJ-Like Zinc-Finger Protein HCF222 Is Required for Thylakoid Membrane Biogenesis in Plants
<p>To understand the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane in higher plants and to identify auxiliary proteins required to build up this highly complex membrane system, we have characterized the allelic nuclear mutants <i>high chlorophyll fluorescence222-1</i> (<i>hcf222-1</i>) and <i>hcf222-2</i> and isolated the causal gene by map-based cloning. In the ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant <i>hcf222-1</i>, the accumulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> (Cytb6f) complex was reduced to 30% compared with the wild type. Other thylakoid membrane complexes accumulated to normal levels. The T-DNA knockout mutant <i>hcf222-2</i> showed a more severe defect with respect to thylakoid membrane proteins and accumulated only 10% of the Cytb6f complex, accompanied by a reduction in photosystem II, the photosystem II light-harvesting complex, and photosystem I. <i>HCF222</i> encodes a protein of 99 amino acids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that has similarities to the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ chaperones. The insulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation assay demonstrated that HCF222 has disulfide reductase activity in vitro. The protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in algae and cyanobacteria. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that a fraction of HCF222-green fluorescent protein was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum but that it also could be recognized in chloroplasts. A fusion construct of HCF222 containing a plastid transit peptide targets the protein into chloroplasts and was able to complement the mutational defect. These findings indicate that the chloroplast-targeted HCF222 is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the Cytb6f complex and is very likely involved in thiol-disulfide biochemistry at the thylakoid membrane.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect genes than large-effect genes, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast gene expression traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse genetics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong>ing that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees. The software is available from <ext-link>www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcs</ext-link>.</p>

Illuminating the Base of the Annelid Tree Using Transcriptomics
<p>Annelida is one of three animal groups possessing segmentation and is central in considerations about the evolution of different character traits. It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750–170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our reconstruction of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and deposit feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filter</span></strong> feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or grooved palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia bearing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.</p>

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with poor neurological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor neurological function at hospital discharge, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized linear regression with a log link was used to test the association between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor neurological outcome. To assess whether there was an association between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor neurological outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> cut points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia. Poor neurological function at hospital discharge occurred in 70% of patients in the entire cohort and in 77% versus 65% among patients with versus without exposure to hyperoxia respectively (absolute risk difference, 12%; 95% confidence interval, 1–23). Hyperoxia was independently associated with poor neurological function (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was associated with a 3% increase in risk of poor neurological outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05). We found that the association with poor neurological outcome began at ≥300 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Early hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with poor neurological function at hospital discharge.</p></sec>

Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction.

Functional Characterization of the <i>GUCY1A3</i> Coronary Artery Disease Risk Locus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A chromosomal locus at 4q32.1 has been genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery disease risk. The locus encompasses <i>GUCY1A3</i>, which encodes the α<sub>1</sub> subunit of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway. The mechanism linking common variants in this region with coronary risk is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression and protein expression were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Putative allele-specific transcription factors were identified with in silico analyses and validated via allele-specific quantification of antibody-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ated chromatin fractions. Regulatory properties of the lead risk variant region were analyzed with reporter gene assays. To assess the effect of zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1 transcription factor (ZEB1), siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. Association of <i>GUCY1A3</i> genotype and cellular phenotypes was analyzed with vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays and platelet aggregation analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Whole-blood <i>GUCY1A3</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in individuals homozygous for the lead (rs7692387) risk variant. Likewise, reporter gene assays demonstrated significantly lower <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity for constructs carrying this allele. In silico analyses located a DNase I hypersensitivity site to rs7692387 and predicted binding of the transcription factor ZEB1 rather to the nonrisk allele, which was confirmed experimentally. Knockdown of <i>ZEB1</i> resulted in more profound reduction of nonrisk allele promoter activity and a significant reduction of endogenous <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression. Ex vivo–studied platelets from homozygous nonrisk allele carriers displayed enhanced inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with homozygous risk allele carriers. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of sGC led to reduced migration only in vascular smooth muscle cells homozygous for the nonrisk allele.

Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Improves Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac surgery is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular and other complications that translate into increased mortality and healthcare costs. This retrospective study was designed to determine whether the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of complications and mortality after cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 1134 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery and coronary artery bypass surgery plus valvular or other procedures were included. Of them, 568 received intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion and 566 did not. Data were adjusted with propensity scores, and multivariate logistic regression was used.

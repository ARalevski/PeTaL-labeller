Revealing hidden spin-momentum locking in a high-temperature cuprate superconductor
<p>Cuprate superconductors have long been thought of as having strong electronic correlations but negligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit coupling. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered that one of the most studied cuprate superconductors, Bi2212, has a nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> locking that circles the Brillouin zone center and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-layer locking that allows states of opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> to be localized in different parts of the unit cell. Our findings pose challenges for the vast majority of models of cuprates, such as the Hubbard model and its variants, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit interaction has been mostly neglected, and open the intriguing question of how the high-temperature superconducting state emerges in the presence of this nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-symmetry breaking and unexpected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-split modes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit coupling.</p>

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> chemical potential characterizes the tendency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> liquids and aid optimization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>tronic devices. Here we introduce single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system’s ferromagnetic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

A coherent Ising machine for 2000-node optimization problems
<p>The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> couplings because of implementations based on localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s, resulting in severe scalability problems.

Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes.

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The tunneling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-polarized electrons across a magnetic tunnel junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong> transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this magneto-Seebeck tunneling by placing a magnetic probe tip in close proximity to a magnetic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the tunneling barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture of the sample lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution.

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong> and a single microwave photon. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong> is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong>, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> qubit registers.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions
<p>Strongly correlated materials are expected to feature unconventional transport properties, such that charge, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>, and heat conduction are potentially independent probes of the dynamics. In contrast to charge transport, the measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> transport in such materials is highly challenging. We observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> conduction and diffusion in a system of ultracold fermionic atoms that realizes the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. For strong interactions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> diffusion is driven by super-exchange and doublon-hole–assisted tunneling, and strongly violates the quantum limit of charge diffusion. The technique developed in this work can be extended to finite doping, which can shed light on the complex interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> and charge in the Hubbard model.</p>

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>tronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> degrees of freedom are locked by strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-valley diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-valley current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> and valley devices.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in optical communication.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding atomic-scale environment.

Using atom manipulation to move single atoms, we found that the hyperfine interaction strongly depended on the binding configuration of the atom.

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet

Chaos-assisted broadband momentum transformation in optical microresonators

Efficient coupling from visible to near-infrared bands is demonstrated between a nanowaveguide and whispering gallery modes with quality factors exceeding 10 million. The broadband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> transformation enhances the device conversion efficiency of the third-harmonic generation by greater than three orders of magnitude over the conventional evanescent-wave coupling.

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks

The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters.

Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains.

Factorial Effects of Evolocumab and Atorvastatin on Lipoprotein Metabolism

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, observed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of charge carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor upstream charge modes. However, so far, charge currents were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-polarized and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-unpolarized <i>v</i> = 2/3 hole-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we observed a significant upstream charge current at short propagation distances in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> unpolarized state.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong> orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> polarization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly magnetized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the magnetic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the magnetization. The interaction is not controlled by the magnetic field per se, but rather by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong> orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

Resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins
<p>Single-qubit rotations and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong> degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong></span></strong>s in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit rotations with fidelities greater than 99%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in ~200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78% fidelity (corrected for errors in state preparation and measurement). Our quantum dot device architecture enables multi-qubit algorithms in silicon.</p>

Anomalous spin correlations and excitonic instability of interacting 2D Weyl fermions
<p>The Coulomb interaction in systems of quasi-relativistic massless electrons has an unscreened long-range component at variance with conventional correlated metals. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to reveal unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> correlations of two-dimensional Weyl fermions in an organic material, causing a divergent increase of the Korringa ratio by a factor of 1000 upon cooling, in marked contrast to conventional metallic behavior. Combined with model calculations, we show that this divergence stems from an interaction-driven velocity renormalization that almost exclusively suppresses zero-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> fluctuations. At low temperatures, the NMR relaxation rate shows an unexpected increase; numerical analyses show that this increase corresponds to internode excitonic fluctuations, a precursor to a transition from massless to massive quasiparticles.</p>

Distinguishing a Majorana zero mode using spin-resolved measurements
<p>One-dimensional topological superconductors host Majorana zero modes (MZMs), the nonlocal property of which could be exploited for quantum computing applications. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy to show that MZMs realized in self-assembled Fe chains on the surface of Pb have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> polarization that exceeds that stemming from the magnetism of these chains.

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-atomic delays. The intra-atomic delay depends on the angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-atomic interactions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong>. Including intra-atomic electron-electron interaction and angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for solid-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent bonds, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile bond. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates dissociation of unloaded bonds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ically strengthens strained bonds. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen bond orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen bonds. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics model.</p>

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet
<p>Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">momentum</span></strong> components, each with an amplitude and phase.

Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-wave with a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quantum numb</span></strong>er of zero. Interference of the f-wave with a spherically symmetric s-wave provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-wave.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Photon-mediated interactions between quantum emitters in a diamond nanocavity

We demonstrate such interactions between pairs of silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to a diamond nanophotonic cavity. When the optical transitions of the two color centers are tuned into resonance, the coupling to the common cavity mode results in a coherent interaction between them, leading to spectrally resolved superradiant and subradiant states. We use the electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> degrees of freedom of the SiV centers to control these optically mediated interactions.

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum physics that still presents conceptual challenges.

This method could be exploited for entanglement-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic field distributions and quantum information tasks.</p>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of signaling by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream signaling proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all cancers and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to signal autonomously without the need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK signaling to maximize disease control in cancer patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated signaling in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven cancers are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS signaling is dysregulated in cancer and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK signaling.</p>

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, observed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of charge carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> charge modes. However, so far, charge currents were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized <i>v</i> = 2/3 hole-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we observed a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> charge current at short propagation distances in the spin unpolarized state.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Transcription Factors PvERF15 and PvMTF-1 Form a Cadmium Stress Transcriptional Pathway
<p>In plants, cadmium (Cd)-responsive transcription factors are key downstream effectors of Cd stress transcriptional pathways, which are capable of converging Cd stress signals through triggering the expression of Cd detoxification genes. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> transcriptional regulatory pathways that modulate their responses to Cd are less clear. Previously, we identified the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) METAL RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (PvMTF-1) that responds to Cd and confers Cd tolerance in planta. Here, we demonstrate an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> transcriptional regulation of the <i>PvMTF-1</i> response to Cd. Using a yeast one-hybrid system, we cloned the bean ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR15 (PvERF15) that binds to the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. <i>PvERF15</i> was strongly induced by Cd stress, and its overexpression resulted in the up-regulation of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. DNA-protein interaction assays further revealed that PvERF15 binds directly to a 19-bp AC-rich element in the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. The AC-rich element serves as a positive element bound by PvERF15 to activate gene expression. More importantly, knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference resulted in reduced Cd-induced expression of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. <i>PvERF15</i> seems to be involved in Cd tolerance, since knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference in bean leaf discs decreased Cd tolerance in a transient assay. Since PvERF15 is a component of the Cd stress transcriptional pathway in beans and <i>PvMTF-1</i> is one of its downstream targets, our findings provide a PvERF15/PvMTF-1 transcriptional pathway and thereby contribute to the understanding of Cd stress transcriptional regulatory pathways in plants.</p>

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on gene expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed genes, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream genes, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> gene. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 genes up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of genes up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we genetically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream genes to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate gene expression.</p>

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid soil. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid soils. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid soils, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid soils.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides chlorophyll for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of chlorophyll for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis control gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the control of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and regulate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-specificity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by controlling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of pavement cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in controlling MAPK signaling specificity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

The Regulation of Sporopollenin Biosynthesis Genes for Rapid Pollen Wall Formation
<p>Sporopollenin is the major component of the outer pollen wall (sexine). It is synthesized using a pathway of approximately eight genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). MALE STERILITY188 (MS188) and its direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulator ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) are two transcription factors essential for tapetum development. Here, we show that all the sporopollenin biosynthesis proteins are specifically expressed in the tapetum and are secreted into anther locules. MS188, a MYB transcription factor expressed in the tapetum, directly regulates the expression of <i>POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE A</i> (<i>PKSA</i>), <i>PKSB</i>, <i>MALE STERILE2</i> (<i>MS2</i>), and a CYTOCHROME P450 gene (<i>CYP703A2</i>). By contrast, the expression of <i>CYP704B1</i>, <i>ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE5</i> (<i>ACOS5</i>), <i>TETRAKETIDE a-PYRONE REDUCTASE1</i> (<i>TKPR1</i>) and <i>TKPR2</i> are significantly reduced in <i>ams</i> mutants but not affected in <i>ms188</i> mutants. However, MS188 but not AMS can activate the expression of <i>CYP704B1</i>, <i>ACOS5</i>, and <i>TKPR1</i>. In <i>ms188</i>, dominant suppression of MS188 homologs reduced the expression of these genes, suggesting that MS188 and other MYB family members play redundant roles in activating their expression. The expression of some sporopollenin synthesis genes (<i>PKSA</i>, <i>PKSB</i>, <i>TKPR2</i>, <i>CYP704B1</i>, and <i>ACOS5</i>) was rescued when <i>MS188</i> was expressed in <i>ams</i>. Therefore, MS188 is a key regulator for activation of sporopollenin synthesis, and AMS and MS188 may form a feed-forward loop that activates the expression of the sporopollenin biosynthesis pathway for rapid pollen wall formation.</p>

Jasmonate Negatively Regulates Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis Cotyledons
<p>Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and water vapor exchange between plants and their environment. Stomatal development is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological processes in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other developmental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as <i>too many mouths-1</i> and <i>stomatal density and distribution1-1</i>) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal development. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal development. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to mediate stomatal development. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal development is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal development of the <i>myc2 myc3 myc4</i> triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal development in Arabidopsis cotyledons.</p>

Ethylene Signaling Modulates Cortical Microtubule Reassembly in Response to Salt Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Regulation of cortical microtubule reorganization is essential for plant cell survival under high salinity conditions. In response to salt stress, microtubules undergo rapid depolymerization followed by reassembly to form a new microtubule network that promotes cell survival; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulatory mechanisms for this recovery response are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that ethylene signaling facilitates salt stress-induced reassembly of cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Microtubule depolymerization was not affected under salt stress following the suppression of ethylene signaling with Ag<sup>+</sup> or in ethylene-insensitive mutants, whereas microtubule reassembly was significantly inhibited. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3, a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, was shown to play a central role in microtubule reassembly under salt stress. In addition, we performed functional characterization of the microtubule-stabilizing protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 (WDL5), which was found to promote ethylene-associated microtubule reassembly and plant salt stress tolerance. These findings indicate that ethylene signaling regulates microtubule reassembly by up-regulating <i>WDL5</i> expression in response to salt stress, thereby implicating ethylene signaling in salt-stress tolerance in plants.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic stress. <i>T. HALOPHILA STRESS RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic stress resistance, especially in salt stress tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and retard the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the target genes’ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The target sequence of the promoter from the target genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to target the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T. HALOPHILA H<sup>+</sup>-PPASE1</i>, and the transcription factors <i>MYB HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED</i> and <i>HOMEOBOX12</i>. In addition, TsNAC1 negatively regulates the expansion of cells, inhibits <i>LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS1</i> and <i>UDP-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE2</i>, and directly controls the expression of <i>MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA14</i>. Based on these results, we propose that TsNAC1 functions as an important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulator of plant abiotic stress responses and vegetative growth.</p>

A uORF Represses the Transcription Factor AtHB1 in Aerial Tissues to Avoid a Deleterious Phenotype
<p>AtHB1 is an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor that participates in hypocotyl elongation under short-day conditions. Here, we show that its expression is posttranscriptionally regulated by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> open reading frame (uORF) located in its 5′ untranslated region. This uORF encodes a highly conserved peptide (CPuORF) that is present in varied monocot and dicot species. The Arabidopsis uORF and its maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) homolog repressed the translation of the main open reading frame in cis, independent of the sequence of the latter. Published ribosome footprinting results and the analysis of a frame-shifted uORF, in which the repression capability was lost, indicated that the uORF causes ribosome stalling. The regulation exerted by the CPuORF was tissue specific and did not act in the absence of light. Moreover, a photosynthetic signal is needed for the CPuORF action, since plants with uncoupled chloroplasts did not show uORF-dependent repression. Plants transformed with the native <i>AtHB1</i> promoter driving <i>AtHB1</i> expression did not show differential phenotypes, whereas those transformed with a construct in which the uORF was mutated exhibited serrated leaves, compact rosettes, and, most significantly, short nondehiscent anthers and siliques containing fewer or no seeds. Thus, we propose that the uncontrolled expression of <i>AtHB1</i> is deleterious for the plant and, hence, finely repressed by a translational mechanism.</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with water stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf water potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil water deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf water supply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf water status.</p>

The BABY BOOM Transcription Factor Activates the LEC1-ABI3-FUS3-LEC2 Network to Induce Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>Somatic embryogenesis is an example of induced cellular totipotency, where embryos develop from vegetative cells rather than from gamete fusion. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth regulators and/or stress treatments. The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2 transcription factors are key regulators of plant cell totipotency, as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings without exogenous growth regulators or stress treatments. Although LEC and BBM proteins regulate the same developmental process, it is not known whether they function in the same molecular pathway. We show that BBM transcriptionally regulates <i>LEC1</i> and <i>LEC2</i>, as well as the two other <i>LAFL</i> genes, <i>FUSCA3</i> (<i>FUS3</i>) and <i>ABSCISIC ACID</i> <i>INSENSITIVE3</i> (<i>ABI3</i>). LEC2 and ABI3 quantitatively regulate BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis, while FUS3 and LEC1 are essential for this process. BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis is dose and context dependent, and the context-dependent phenotypes are associated with differential <i>LAFL</i> expression. We also uncover functional redundancy for somatic embryogenesis among other Arabidopsis BBM-like proteins and show that one of these proteins, PLETHORA2, also regulates <i>LAFL</i> gene expression. Our data place BBM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of other major regulators of plant embryo identity and totipotency.</p>

NTL8 Regulates Trichome Formation in Arabidopsis by Directly Activating R3 MYB Genes <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>
<p>The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) are plant-specific transcription factors that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development and plant response to environmental stimuli. We report here the identification of NTM1-LIKE8 (NTL8), a membrane-associated NAC transcription factor, as a novel regulator of trichome formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). From an activation-tagged Arabidopsis population, we identified a dominant, gain-of-function mutant with glabrous inflorescence stem. By using plasmid rescue and RT-PCR analyses, we found that <i>NTL8</i> was tagged; thus, the mutant was named <i>ntl8-1 Dominant</i> (<i>ntl8-1D</i>). Recapitulation experiment further confirmed that the phenotype observed in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant was caused by elevated expression of <i>NTL8</i>. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of the single-repeat R3 MYB genes <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> (<i>TRY</i>) and <i>TRICHOMELESS1</i> (<i>TCL1</i>) was elevated in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant. Genetic analyses demonstrated that NTL8 acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of TRY and TCL1 in the regulation of trichome formation. When recruited to the promoter region of the reporter gene <i>Gal4:GUS</i> by a fused GAL4 DNA-binding domain, NTL8 activated the expression of the reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i> are direct targets of NTL8. However, NTL8 did not interact with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE9, another transcription factor that regulates the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>, in yeast and plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NTL8 negatively regulates trichome formation in Arabidopsis by directly activating the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>.</p>

ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 Is Required for <i>M. truncatula</i> CLE12, But Not CLE13, Peptide Signaling through the SUNN Receptor Kinase
<p>The combinatorial interaction of a receptor kinase and a modified CLE peptide is involved in several developmental processes in plants, including autoregulation of nodulation (AON), which allows legumes to limit the number of root nodules formed based on available nitrogen and previous rhizobial colonization. Evidence supports the modification of CLE peptides by enzymes of the hydroxyproline <i>O</i>-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT/RDN) family. Here, we show by grafting and genetic analysis in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that, in the AON pathway, RDN1, functioning in the root, acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of the receptor kinase SUNN, functioning in the shoot. As expected for a glycosyltransferase, we found that RDN1 and RDN2 proteins are localized to the Golgi, as was shown previously for AtHPAT1. Using composite plants with transgenic hairy roots, we show that <i>RDN1</i> and <i>RDN2</i> orthologs from dicots as well as a related <i>RDN</i> gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) can rescue the phenotype of <i>rdn1-2</i> when expressed constitutively, but the less related <i>MtRDN3</i> cannot. The timing of the induction of <i>MtCLE12</i> and <i>MtCLE13</i> peptide genes (negative regulators of AON) in nodulating roots is not altered by the mutation of <i>RDN1</i> or <i>SUNN</i>, although expression levels are higher. Plants with transgenic roots constitutively expressing <i>MtCLE12</i> require both RDN1 and SUNN to prevent nodule formation, while plants constitutively expressing <i>MtCLE13</i> require only SUNN, suggesting that the two CLEs have different requirements for function. Combined with previous work, these data support a model in which RDN1 arabinosylates MtCLE12, and this modification is necessary for the transport and/or reception of the AON signal by the SUNN kinase.</p>

A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>It is well known that abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence and premature leaf senescence negatively affect the yield of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this relationship, especially the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> transcriptional network that modulates ABA level during leaf senescence, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a rice NAC transcription factor, OsNAC2, that participates in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of <i>OsNAC2</i> dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrated that OsNAC2 directly activates expression of chlorophyll degradation genes, <i>OsSGR</i> and <i>OsNYC3</i>. Moreover, ectopic expression of <i>OsNAC2</i> leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly up-regulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (<i>OsNCED3</i> and <i>OsZEP1</i>) as well as down-regulating the ABA catabolic gene (<i>OsABA8ox1</i>). Interestingly, <i>OsNAC2</i> is upregulated by a lower level of ABA but downregulated by a higher level of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of <i>OsNAC2</i> by ABA. Additionally, reduced <i>OsNAC2</i> expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines. The novel ABA-NAC-SAGs regulatory module might provide a new insight into the molecular action of ABA to enhance leaf senescence and elucidates the transcriptional network of ABA production during leaf senescence in rice.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of programmed cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal opening through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal opening. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal opening under red light.</p>

Light Controls Cytokinin Signaling via Transcriptional Regulation of Constitutively Active Sensor Histidine Kinase CKI1
<p>In plants, the multistep phosphorelay (MSP) pathway mediates a range of regulatory processes, including those activated by cytokinins. The cross talk between cytokinin response and light has been known for a long time. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between light and cytokinin signaling remains elusive. In the screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulators we identified a <i>LONG PALE HYPOCOTYL</i> (<i>LPH</i>) gene whose activity is indispensable for spatiotemporally correct expression of <i>CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1</i> (<i>CKI1</i>), encoding the constitutively active sensor His kinase that activates MSP signaling. <i>lph</i> is a new allele of <i>HEME OXYGENASE1</i> (<i>HY1</i>) that encodes the key protein in the biosynthesis of phytochromobilin, a cofactor of photoconvertible phytochromes. Our analysis confirmed the light-dependent regulation of the <i>CKI1</i> expression pattern. We show that <i>CKI1</i> expression is under the control of phytochrome A (phyA), functioning as a dual (both positive and negative) regulator of <i>CKI1</i> expression, presumably via the phyA-regulated transcription factors (TF) PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1. Changes in <i>CKI1</i> expression observed in <i>lph</i>/<i>hy1</i>-<i>7</i> and <i>phy</i> mutants correlate with misregulation of MSP signaling, changed cytokinin sensitivity, and developmental aberrations that were previously shown to be associated with cytokinin and/or CKI1 action. Besides that, we demonstrate a novel role of phyA-dependent <i>CKI1</i> expression in the hypocotyl elongation and hook development during skotomorphogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that the light-dependent regulation of <i>CKI1</i> provides a plausible mechanistic link underlying the well-known interaction between light- and cytokinin-controlled plant development.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast development is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots develop chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast development in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal closure and NO production in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO production and stomatal closure but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal closure in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO production. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

TATA Box Insertion Provides a Selection Mechanism Underpinning Adaptations to Fe Deficiency
<p>Intraspecific genetic variation is essential for the responses and adaption of plants to evolutionary challenges, such as changing environmental conditions. The development of the Earth’s aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus <i>Malus</i> adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the <i>Iron-Regulated Transporter1</i> (<i>IRT1</i>) promoter. Specifically, an <i>IRT1</i> mutant allele with a TATA-box insertion in the promoter region <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of the coding region exhibited increased <i>IRT1</i> expression. The altered <i>IRT1</i> promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes correlates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-box correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency. More broadly, this study reveals a new mechanism for enhancing gene expression to help plants adapt to different environments, providing new insights into molecular genetic divergence in plants.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

Transcription Factors WOX11/12 Directly Activate <i>WOX5/7</i> to Promote Root Primordia Initiation and Organogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>De novo organogenesis, which gives rise to adventitious roots and shoots, is a type of plant regeneration for survival after wounding. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), two main cell fate transition steps are required to establish the root primordium during de novo root organogenesis from leaf explants. The first step from regeneration-competent cells to root founder cells involves activation of <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11</i> (<i>WOX11</i>) and <i>WOX12</i> (<i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i>) expression by auxin. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the second step of fate transition from root founder cells to root primordium is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the expression levels of <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> decrease while those of <i>WOX5</i> and <i>7</i> (<i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>) increase during the transition from root founder cells to the root primordium. <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> function genetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>, and the WOX11/12 proteins directly bind to the promoters of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> to activate their transcription. Mutations in <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> result in defective primordium formation. Overall, our data indicate that the expression switch from <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> to <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> is critical for initiation of the root primordium during de novo root organogenesis.</p>

An NADPH-Oxidase/Polyamine Oxidase Feedback Loop Controls Oxidative Burst Under Salinity
<p>The apoplastic polyamine oxidase (PAO) catalyzes the oxidation of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, contributing to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulation. However, it is yet unclear whether apoplastic PAO is part of a network that coordinates the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salinity or if it acts independently. Here, we unravel that NADPH oxidase and apoplastic PAO cooperate to control the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>) in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). To examine to what extent apoplastic PAO constitutes part of a ROS-generating network, we examined ROS accumulation in guard cells of plants overexpressing or down-regulating apoplastic PAO (lines S2.2 and A2, respectively) or down-regulating NADPH oxidase (line AS-<i>NtRbohD</i>/<i>F</i>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed that, under salinity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased in S2.2 and decreased in A2 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-So showed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> levels correlated positively with that of apoplastic PAO (i.e. showed high and low levels in S2.2 and A2, respectively). By using AS-<i>NtRbohD/F</i> lines and a pharmacological approach, we could show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> accumulation at the onset of salinity stress was dependent on NADPH oxidase, indicating that NADPH oxidase is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of apoplastic PAO. Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase and the apoplastic PAO form a feed-forward ROS amplification loop, which impinges on oxidative state and culminates in the execution of programmed cell death. We propose that the PAO/NADPH oxidase loop is a central hub in the plethora of responses controlling salt stress tolerance, with potential functions extending beyond stress tolerance.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> genes, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C gene (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C genes. A larger 5′ extended gene could be translated from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> gene complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in gene C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> gene within the larger C<sub>B</sub> gene and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

Precise control of miR-125b levels is required to create a regeneration-permissive environment after spinal cord injury: a cross-species comparison between salamander and rat
<p>Most spinal cord injuries lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable regenerative abilities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican axolotl salamander (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels of one of these miRNAs (miR-125b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct regeneration of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target <i>Sema4D</i> in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR-125b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated <i>Sema4D</i> and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of <i>miR-125b</i> and <i>Sema4D</i> must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote regeneration. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s regeneration-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian spinal cord injuries.</p>

<i>H. pylori</i> virulence factor CagA increases intestinal cell proliferation by Wnt pathway activation in a transgenic zebrafish model
<p>Infection with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, and infection with strains carrying the virulence factor CagA significantly increases this risk. To investigate the mechanisms by which CagA promotes carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing CagA ubiquitously or in the anterior intestine. Transgenic zebrafish expressing either the wild-type or a phosphorylation-resistant form of CagA exhibited significantly increased rates of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and showed significant upregulation of the Wnt target genes <i>cyclinD1</i>, <i>axin2</i> and the zebrafish <i>c-myc</i> ortholog <i>myca</i>. Coexpression of CagA with a loss-of-function allele encoding the β-catenin destruction complex protein Axin1 resulted in a further increase in intestinal proliferation. Coexpression of CagA with a null allele of the key β-catenin transcriptional cofactor Tcf4 restored intestinal proliferation to wild-type levels. These results provide <i>in vivo</i> evidence of Wnt pathway activation by CagA downstream of or in parallel to the β-catenin destruction complex and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of Tcf4. Long-term transgenic expression of wild-type CagA, but not the phosphorylation-resistant form, resulted in significant hyperplasia of the adult intestinal epithelium. We further utilized this model to demonstrate that oncogenic cooperation between CagA and a loss-of-function allele of <i>p53</i> is sufficient to induce high rates of intestinal small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, establishing the utility of our transgenic zebrafish model in the study of CagA-associated gastrointestinal cancers.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a regulated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial regulator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin focus that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2 enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> or parallel to actin remodeling. Regulators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin focus size and altered focus morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin focus are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin regulators at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these regulators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that regulates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

Cardioprotective Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2 by Suppressing Apoptosis and Necroptosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Programmed cell death, including apoptosis, mitochondria-mediated necrosis, and necroptosis, is critically involved in ischemic cardiac injury, pathological cardiac remodeling, and heart failure progression. Whereas apoptosis and mitochondria-mediated necrosis signaling is well established, the regulatory mechanisms of necroptosis and its significance in the pathogenesis of heart failure remain elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2) in regulating myocardial necroptosis and remodeling using genetic mouse models. We also performed molecular and cellular biology studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which Traf2 regulates necroptosis signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a critical role for Traf2 in myocardial survival and homeostasis by suppressing necroptosis. Cardiac-specific deletion of <i>Traf2</i> in mice triggered necroptotic cardiac cell death, pathological remodeling, and heart failure. Plasma tumor necrosis factor α level was significantly elevated in <i>Traf2</i>-deficient mice, and genetic ablation of <i>TNFR1</i> largely abrogated pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction associated with Traf2 deletion. Mechanistically, Traf2 critically regulates receptor-interacting proteins 1 and 3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein necroptotic signaling with the adaptor protein tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein with death domain as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulator and transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 as a downstream effector. It is important to note that genetic deletion of <i>RIP3</i> largely rescued the cardiac phenotype triggered by Traf2 deletion, validating a critical role of necroptosis in regulating pathological remodeling and heart failure propensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results identify an important Traf2-mediated, NFκB-independent, prosurvival pathway in the heart by suppressing necroptotic signaling, which may serve as a new therapeutic target for pathological remodeling and heart failure.</p></sec>

SIRT2 Acts as a Cardioprotective Deacetylase in Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by stresses such as aging and neurohumoral activation is an independent risk factor for heart failure and is considered a target for the treatment of heart failure. However, the mechanisms underlying pathological cardiac hypertrophy remain largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the roles of SIRT2 in aging-related and angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Male C57BL/6J wild-type and <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice were subjected to the investigation of aging-related cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was also induced by Ang II (1.3 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks) in male C57BL/6J <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice, cardiac-specific <i>SIRT2</i> transgenic (<i>SIRT2</i>-Tg) mice, and their respective littermates (8 to ≈12 weeks old). Metformin (200 mg/kg/d) was used to treat wild-type and <i>Sirt2</i> knockout mice infused with Ang II. Cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac function were examined in these mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SIRT2 protein expression levels were downregulated in hypertrophic hearts from mice. <i>Sirt2</i> knockout markedly exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and decreased cardiac ejection fraction and fractional shortening in aged (24-month-old) mice and Ang II–infused mice. Conversely, cardiac-specific <i>SIRT2</i> overexpression protected the hearts against Ang II–induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and rescued cardiac function. Mechanistically, SIRT2 maintained the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in aged and Ang II–induced hypertrophic hearts in vivo as well as in cardiomyocytes in vitro. We identified the liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> kinase of AMPK, as the direct target of SIRT2. SIRT2 bound to LKB1 and deacetylated it at lysine 48, which promoted the phosphorylation of LKB1 and the subsequent activation of LKB1-AMPK signaling. Remarkably, the loss of SIRT2 blunted the response of AMPK to metformin treatment in mice infused with Ang II and repressed the metformin-mediated reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and protection of cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SIRT2 promotes AMPK activation by deacetylating the kinase LKB1. Loss of SIRT2 reduces AMPK activation, promotes aging-related and Ang II–induced cardiac hypertrophy, and blunts metformin-mediated cardioprotective effects. These findings indicate that SIRT2 will be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in aging- and stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Common diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are complex in etiology. The interaction of genetic susceptibility with lifestyle factors may play a prominent role. However, gene-lifestyle interactions for CHD have been difficult to identify. Here, we investigate interaction of smoking behavior, a potent lifestyle factor, with genotypes that have been shown to associate with CHD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data on 60 919 CHD cases and 80 243 controls from 29 studies for gene-smoking interactions for genetic variants at 45 loci previously reported to be associated with CHD risk. We also studied 5 loci associated with smoking behavior. Study-specific gene-smoking interaction effects were calculated and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analyses. Interaction analyses were declared to be significant at a <i>P</i> value of <1.0×10<sup>–3</sup> (Bonferroni correction for 50 tests).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified novel gene-smoking interaction for a variant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> of the <i>ADAMTS7</i> gene. Every T allele of rs7178051 was associated with lower CHD risk by 12% in never-smokers (<i>P</i>=1.3×10<sup>–16</sup>) in comparison with 5% in ever-smokers (<i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>–4</sup>), translating to a 60% loss of CHD protection conferred by this allelic variation in people who smoked tobacco (interaction <i>P</i> value=8.7×10<sup>–5</sup>). The protective T allele at rs7178051 was also associated with reduced <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression in human aortic endothelial cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines. Exposure of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells to cigarette smoke extract led to induction of <i>ADAMTS7.</i></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Allelic variation at rs7178051 that associates with reduced <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression confers stronger CHD protection in never-smokers than in ever-smokers. Increased vascular <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression may contribute to the loss of CHD protection in smokers.</p></sec>

Retinol-Binding Protein-Dependent Cholesterol Uptake Regulates Macrophage Foam Cell Formation and Promotes Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is an adipokine that plays decisive roles in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Elevated circulating RBP4 levels were reported to be associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but the precise role of RBP4 in atherosclerotic diseases and its mechanisms of action remain elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum RBP4 levels of 1683 participants from South China were evaluated and the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events was followed up for 5 years. Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice infected with RBP4-overexpressing/silencing adenovirus, J774A.1 macrophages, and primary peritoneal macrophages from RBP4 transgenic mice were used for investigating the function of RBP4 in foam cell formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Prospective cohort studies revealed that baseline serum RBP4 level was an independent predictor for incidence of adverse cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Increased RBP4 expression was observed in atherosclerotic lesions of aortic specimens from both humans and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, and RBP4 was localized to areas rich in macrophage foam cells. RBP4 inhibition attenuated whereas overexpression accelerated atherosclerosis progression in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Both treatment with exogenous recombinant RBP4 and overexpression of RBP4 gene promoted macrophage-derived foam cell formation through the activation of scavenger-receptor CD36-mediated cholesterol uptake, and RBP4 transcriptionally upregulated CD36 expression in a manner dependent on jun N-terminal kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. The tyrosine kinase c-Src was identified as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">upstream</span></strong> regulator of jun N-terminal kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-mediated CD36-dependent cholesterol uptake, and RBP4 challenge was found to alter the membrane distribution of c-Src and cause c-Src to partition into lipid-raft membrane subdomains, where the kinase was activated. Lastly, Toll-like receptor 4, but not retinol or stimulated by retinoic acid 6, mediated the inductive effects of RBP4 in macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Inclusion of RBP4 levels in traditional models enhances the predictive ability for the incidence of atherosclerotic events. RBP4 promotes atherogenesis by inducing macrophage-derived foam cell formation.</p></sec>

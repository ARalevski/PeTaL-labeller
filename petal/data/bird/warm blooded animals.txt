Seasonal variation in the thermal responses to changing environmental temperature in the world's northernmost land bird
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The Svalbard ptarmigan, much like low-latitude birds but unlike sympatric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>s, does not employ extensive local heterothermy for cold protection. Instead, these birds maintain prime-quality insulation – a feature shared with many other High-Arctic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>s.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>ic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>y, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>y observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>y allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>y could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeotherm</span></strong>y in mammals.</p>

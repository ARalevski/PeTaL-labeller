Reducing eIF4E-eIF4G interactions restores the balance between protein synthesis and actin dynamics in fragile X syndrome model mice
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene, which encodes fragile X mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding protein that represses the translation of its target mRNAs. One mechanism by which FMRP represses translation is through its association with cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which subsequently sequesters and inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). CYFIP1 shuttles between the FMRP-eIF4E complex and the Rac1–Wave regulatory complex, thereby connecting translational regulation to actin dynamics and dendritic spine morphology, which are dysregulated in FXS model mice that lack FMRP. Treating FXS mice with 4EGI-1, which blocks interactions between eIF4E and eIF4G, a critical interaction partner for translational initiation, reversed defects in hippocampus-dependent memory and spine morphology. We also found that 4EGI-1 normalized the phenotypes of enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)–mediated long-term depression (LTD), enhanced Rac1–p21-activated kinase (PAK)–cofilin signaling, altered actin dynamics, and dysregulated CYFIP1/eIF4E and CYFIP1/Rac1 interactions in FXS mice. Our findings are consistent with the idea that an imbalance in protein synthesis and actin dynamics contributes to pathophysiology in FXS mice, and suggest that targeting eIF4E may be a strategy for treating FXS.</p>

Nrf2 inactivation enhances placental angiogenesis in a preeclampsia mouse model and improves maternal and fetal outcomes
<p>Placental activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to affect placental angiogenesis, which is critical for preventing preeclampsia pathology. We examined the role of ROS in preeclampsia by genetically modifying the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, a cellular antioxidant defense system, in a mouse model of RAS-induced preeclampsia. Nrf2 deficiency would be expected to impair cellular antioxidant responses; however, Nrf2 deficiency in preeclamptic mice improved maternal and fetal survival, ameliorated intra-uterine growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation, and augmented oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, the placentas of Nrf2-deficient mice had increased endothelial cell proliferation with dense vascular networks. In contrast, the placentas of preeclamptic mice with overactive Nrf2 showed repressed angiogenesis, which was associated with decreased expression of genes encoding angiogenic chemokines and cytokines. Our findings support the notion that ROS-mediated signaling is essential for maintaining placental angiogenesis in preeclampsia and may provide mechanistic insight into the negative results of clinical trials for antioxidants in preeclampsia.</p>

Hyperactive locomotion in a <i>Drosophila</i> model is a functional readout for the synaptic abnormalities underlying fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual disability and autism and affects ~1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. The discovery of effective treatments for FXS has been hampered by the lack of effective animal models and phenotypic readouts for drug screening. FXS ensues from the epigenetic silencing or loss-of-function mutation of the <i>fragile X mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation 1</i> (<i>FMR1</i>) gene, which encodes an RNA binding protein that associates with and represses the translation of target mRNAs. We previously found that the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) downstream of augmented synthesis of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 2 receptor (BMPR2) promotes aberrant synaptic development in mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> models of FXS and that these molecular and cellular markers were correlated in patients with FXS. We report that larval locomotion is augmented in a <i>Drosophila</i> FXS model. Genetic or pharmacological intervention on the BMPR2-LIMK pathway ameliorated the synaptic abnormality and locomotion phenotypes of FXS larvae, as well as hyperactivity in an FXS mouse model. Our study demonstrates that (i) the BMPR2-LIMK pathway is a promising therapeutic target for FXS and (ii) the locomotion phenotype of FXS larvae is a quantitative functional readout for the neuromorphological phenotype associated with FXS and is amenable to the screening novel FXS therapeutics.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p>Laser cooling of a neutral plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of neutral plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties.

Fragile X mental retardation 1 gene enhances the translation of large autism-related proteins
<p>Mutations in the fragile X mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation 1 gene (<i>FMR1</i>) cause the most common inherited human autism spectrum disorder. FMR1 influences messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, but identifying functional targets has been difficult. We analyzed quiescent <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes, which, like neural synapses, depend heavily on translating stored mRNA. Ribosome profiling revealed that FMR1 enhances rather than represses the translation of mRNAs that overlap previously identified FMR1 targets, and acts preferentially on large proteins. Human homologs of at least 20 targets are associated with dominant intellectual disability, and 30 others with recessive neurodevelopmental dysfunction. Stored oocytes lacking FMR1 usually generate embryos with severe neural defects, unlike stored wild-type oocytes, which suggests that translation of multiple large proteins by stored mRNAs is defective in fragile X syndrome and possibly other autism spectrum disorders.</p>

NUFIP1 is a ribosome receptor for starvation-induced ribophagy
<p>The lysosome degrades and recycles macromolecules, signals to the master growth regulator mTORC1 [mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1], and is associated with human disease. We performed quantitative proteomic analyses of rapidly isolated lysosomes and found that nutrient levels and mTOR dynamically modulate the lysosomal proteome. Upon mTORC1 inhibition, NUFIP1 (nuclear fragile X mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation–interacting protein 1) redistributes from the nucleus to autophagosomes and lysosomes. Upon these conditions, NUFIP1 interacts with ribosomes and delivers them to autophagosomes by directly binding to microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B). The starvation-induced degradation of ribosomes via autophagy (ribophagy) depends on the capacity of NUFIP1 to bind LC3B and promotes cell survival. We propose that NUFIP1 is a receptor for the selective autophagy of ribosomes.</p>

Phosphoric acid as a precursor to chemicals traditionally synthesized from white phosphorus
<p>White phosphorus, generated in the legacy thermal process for phosphate rock upgrading, has long been the key industrial intermediate for the synthesis of phosphorus-containing chemicals, including herbicides, flame-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ants, catalyst ligands, battery electrolytes, pharmaceuticals, and detergents. In contrast, phosphate fertilizers are made on a much larger scale from phosphoric acid, obtained by treating phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. Dehydration of phosphoric acid using sodium chloride gives trimetaphosphate, and here we report that trichlorosilane, primarily used for the production of high-purity silicon, reduces trimetaphosphate to the previously unknown bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphide anion. This anion offers an entry point to value-added organophosphorus chemicals such as primary and secondary alkyl phosphines, and thus to organophosphinates, and can also be used to prepare phosphine gas and the hexafluorophosphate anion, all previously available only downstream from white phosphorus.</p>

ANAC017 Coordinates Organellar Functions and Stress Responses by Reprogramming Retrograde Signaling
<p>Mitochondria adjust their activities in response to external and internal stimuli to optimize growth via the mitochondrial retrograde response signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NAC domain transcription factor ANAC017 has previously been identified as a regulator of the mitochondrial retrograde response. We show here that overexpression of <i>ANAC017</i> in Arabidopsis leads to growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation, altered leaf development with decreased cell size and viability, and early leaf senescence. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that increased <i>ANAC017</i> expression leads to higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial stress, cell death/autophagy, and leaf senescence under nonlimiting growth conditions as well as extensive repression of chloroplast function. Gene regulatory network analysis indicated that a complex hierarchy of transcription factors exists downstream of ANAC017. These involve a set of up-regulated ANAC and WRKY transcription factors associated with organellar signaling and senescence. The network also includes a number of ethylene- and gibberellic acid-related transcription factors with established functions in stress responses and growth regulation, which down-regulate their target genes. A number of BASIC LEUCINE-ZIPPER MOTIF transcription factors involved in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response or balancing of energy homeostasis via the SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 were also down-regulated by <i>ANAC017</i> overexpression. Our results show that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane tethering of the constitutively expressed ANAC017, and its controlled release, are crucial to fine-tune a fast reactive but potentially harmful signaling cascade. Thus, ANAC017 is a master regulator of cellular responses with mitochondria acting as central sensors.</p>

The Chromatin Factor HNI9 and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 Maintain ROS Homeostasis under High Nitrogen Provision
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can accumulate in cells at excessive levels, leading to unbalanced redox states and to potential oxidative stress, which can have damaging effects on the molecular components of plant cells. Several environmental conditions have been described as causing an elevation of ROS production in plants. Consequently, activation of detoxification responses is necessary to maintain ROS homeostasis at physiological levels. Misregulation of detoxification systems during oxidative stress can ultimately cause growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation and developmental defects. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants grown in a high nitrogen (N) environment express a set of genes involved in detoxification of ROS that maintain ROS at physiological levels. We show that the chromatin factor HIGH NITROGEN INSENSITIVE9 (HNI9) is an important mediator of this response and is required for the expression of detoxification genes. Mutation in HNI9 leads to elevated ROS levels and ROS-dependent phenotypic defects under high but not low N provision. In addition, we identify ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 as a major transcription factor required for activation of the detoxification program under high N. Our results demonstrate the requirement of a balance between N metabolism and ROS production, and our work establishes major regulators required to control ROS homeostasis under conditions of excess N.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and transported into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is transported into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

GOLDEN2-LIKE Transcription Factors Regulate <i>WRKY40</i> Expression in Response to Abscisic Acid
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GARP (Golden2, ARR-B, Psr1) family transcription factors, GOLDEN2-LIKE1 and -2 (GLK1/2), function in different biological processes; however, whether and how these transcription factors modulate the response to abscisic acid (ABA) remain unknown. In this study, we used a <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant to examine the role of GLK1/2 in the ABA response. The <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant displayed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes during seed germination and seedling development and an osmotic stress-resistant phenotype during seedling development. Genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis of the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant revealed that GLK1/2 regulate several ABA-responsive genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, in the presence of ABA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation assays showed that GLK1/2 directly associate with the <i>WRKY40</i> promoter via the recognition of a consensus sequence. Additionally, RNA sequencing analysis of the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant and <i>wrky40</i> single mutant revealed that GLK1/2 and WRKY40 control a common set of downstream target genes in response to ABA. Furthermore, results of a genetic interaction test showed that the <i>glk1 glk2 wrky40</i> triple mutant displayed similar ABA hypersensitivity to the <i>wrky40</i> single mutant and the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant, while the <i>glk1 glk2 wrky40 abi5-c</i> (<i>ABI5 CRISPR/Cas9</i> mutant) quadruple mutant displayed similar ABA hyposensitivity to the <i>abi5-7</i> single mutant. Based on these results, we propose that the GLK1/2-WRKY40 transcription module plays a negative regulatory role in the ABA response.</p>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of land plants, some specialized cells, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary cell wall thickening. Secondary cell walls contain additional lignin, compared with primary cell walls, thus providing mechanical strength and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate wall thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in cells undergoing secondary cell wall thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed early elongation of the inflorescence stem, shorter fibers, slower root growth, and shorter flower filaments. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer fiber cells, reduced secondary cell wall thickening in fiber and vessel cells, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and cellular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary cell wall thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced cell elongation and inhibited secondary cell wall thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating cell elongation and cell wall thickening during growth and development.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>s electron transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Betaine Lipid Is Crucial for Adapting to Low Temperature and Phosphate Deficiency in <i>Nannochloropsis</i>
<p>Diacylglyceryl-<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the phosphatidylcholine in bacteria, fungi, algae, and basal land plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile microalga <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i>, DGTS contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is relatively scarce in phosphatidylcholine, implying that DGTS has a unique physiological role. In this study, we addressed the role of DGTS in <i>N. oceanica</i>. We identified two DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain configurations compared to previously identified DGTS synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation under phosphate starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for DGTS in the adaptation to this condition. Under normal conditions, DGTS deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with high EPA content, whereas excessive production of DGTS induced by gene overexpression led to a decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in EPA biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing to acquire EPA or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The mutant lacking DGTS also displayed impaired growth and a lower proportion of EPA in extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results indicate that DGTS is involved in the adaptation to low temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the DGTS-dependent adaptation to phosphate starvation in <i>N. oceanica</i>.</p>

Proline Accumulation Is Regulated by Transcription Factors Associated with Phosphate Starvation
<p>Pro accumulation in plants is a well-documented physiological response to osmotic stress caused by drought or salinity. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the stress and ABA-induced Δ1-PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE1 (<i>P5CS1</i>) gene was previously shown to control Pro biosynthesis in such adverse conditions. To identify regulatory factors that control the transcription of <i>P5CS1</i>, Y1H screens were performed with a genomic fragment of <i>P5CS1</i>, containing 1.2-kB promoter and 0.8-kb transcribed regions. The myeloblastosis (MYB)-type transcription factors PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE1 (PHL1) were identified to bind to <i>P5CS1</i> regulatory sequences in the first intron, which carries a conserved PHR1-binding site (P1BS) motif. Binding of PHR1 and PHL1 factors to P1BS was confirmed by Y1H, electrophoretic mobility assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Phosphate starvation led to gradual increase in Pro content in wild-type Arabidopsis plants as well as transcriptional activation of <i>P5CS1</i> and PRO DEHYDROGENASE2 genes. Induction of <i>P5CS1</i> transcription and Pro accumulation during phosphate deficiency was considerably reduced by <i>phr1</i> and <i>phl1</i> mutations and was impaired in the ABA-deficient <i>aba2-3</i> and ABA-insensitive <i>abi4-1</i> mutants. Growth and viability of <i>phr1phl1</i> double mutant was significantly reduced in phosphate-depleted medium, while growth was only marginally affected in the <i>aba2-3</i> mutants, suggesting that ABA is implicated in growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation in such nutritional stress.

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

Role of Type 2 NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase NdbC in Redox Regulation of Carbon Allocation in <i>Synechocystis</i>

Even though the NDH-1 complex is a well-characterized protein complex in the thylakoid membrane of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter <i>Synechocystis</i>), the exact roles of different NDH-2s remain poorly understood. To elucidate this question, we studied the function of NdbC, one of the three NDH-2s in <i>Synechocystis</i>, by constructing a deletion mutant (Δ<i>ndbC</i>) for a corresponding protein and submitting the mutant to physiological and biochemical characterization as well as to comprehensive proteomics analysis. We demonstrate that the deletion of NdbC, localized to the plasma membrane, affects several metabolic pathways in <i>Synechocystis</i> in autotrophic growth conditions without prominent effects on photosynthesis. Foremost, the deletion of NdbC leads, directly or indirectly, to compromised sugar catabolism, to glycogen accumulation, and to distorted cell division. Deficiencies in several sugar catabolic routes were supported by severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation of growth of the Δ<i>ndbC</i> mutant under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions but not under mixotrophy. Thus, NdbC has a significant function in regulating carbon allocation between storage and the biosynthesis pathways. In addition, the deletion of NdbC increases the amount of cyclic electron transfer, possibly via the NDH-1<sub>2</sub> complex, and decreases the expression of several transporters in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> growth conditions.</p>

<p>Loss-of-function mutations in ORGANELLE RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM plastid editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA editing interacting protein/multiple organellar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some plastid RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that plastid RNA editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of plastid genes.</p>

Photoperiod Affects the Phenotype of Mitochondrial Complex I Mutants
<p>Plant mutants for genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial complex I (CI; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the first enzyme of the respiratory chain, display various phenotypes depending on growth conditions. Here, we examined the impact of photoperiod, a major environmental factor controlling plant development, on two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CI mutants: a new insertion mutant interrupted in both <i>ndufs8.1</i> and <i>ndufs8.2</i> genes encoding the NDUFS8 subunit and the previously characterized <i>ndufs4</i> CI mutant. In the long day (LD) condition, both <i>ndufs8.1</i> and <i>ndufs8.2</i> single mutants were indistinguishable from Columbia-0 at phenotypic and biochemical levels, whereas the <i>ndufs8.1 ndufs8.2</i> double mutant was devoid of detectable holo-CI assembly/activity, showed higher alternative oxidase content/activity, and displayed a growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation phenotype similar to that of the <i>ndufs4</i> mutant. Although growth was more affected in <i>ndufs4</i> than in <i>ndufs8.1 ndufs8.2</i> under the short day (SD) condition, both mutants displayed a similar impairment of growth acceleration after transfer to LD compared with the wild type. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics showed that overall metabolism was less responsive to the SD-to-LD transition in mutants than in the wild type. The typical LD acclimation of carbon and nitrogen assimilation as well as redox-related parameters was not observed in <i>ndufs8.1 ndufs8</i>. Similarly, NAD(H) content, which was higher in the SD condition in both mutants than in Columbia-0, did not adjust under LD. We propose that altered redox homeostasis and NAD(H) content/redox state control the phenotype of CI mutants and photoperiod acclimation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Oxidation of P700 in Photosystem I Is Essential for the Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>The photoinhibition of photosystem I (PSI) is lethal to oxygenic phototrophs. Nevertheless, it is unclear how photodamage occurs or how oxygenic phototrophs prevent it. Here, we provide evidence that keeping P700 (the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI) oxidized protects PSI. Previous studies have suggested that PSI photoinhibition does not occur in the two model cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942, when photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation was suppressed under low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure even in mutants deficient in flavodiiron protein (FLV), which mediates alternative electron flow. The lack of FLV in <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 (S. 7002), however, is linked directly to reduced growth and PSI photodamage under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions. Unlike <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC 7942, S. 7002 reduced P700 during CO<sub>2</sub>-limited illumination in the absence of FLV, resulting in decreases in both PSI and photosynthetic activities. Even at normal air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the growth of S. 7002 mutant was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed relative to that of the wild type. Therefore, P700 oxidation is essential for protecting PSI against photoinhibition. Here, we present various strategies to alleviate PSI photoinhibition in cyanobacteria.</p>

Secretory COPII Protein SEC31B Is Required for Pollen Wall Development
<p>The pollen wall protects pollen grains from abiotic and biotic stresses. During pollen wall development, tapetal cells play a vital role by secreting proteins, signals, and pollen wall material to ensure microspore development. But the regulatory mechanism underlying the secretory pathway of the tapetum is largely unknown. Here, we characterize the essential role of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COPII protein SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) in pollen wall development and the secretory activity of tapetal cells. The sporophyte-controlled <i>atsec31b</i> mutant exhibits severe pollen and seed abortion. Transmission electron microscopy observation indicates that pollen exine formation in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant is disrupted significantly. AtSEC31B is a functional COPII protein revealed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site localization, interaction with AtSEC13A, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant. A genetic tapetum-specific rescue assay indicates that AtSEC31B functions primarily in the tapetum. Moreover, deletion of AtSEC31B interrupted the formation of the ER-derived tapetosome and altered the location of the ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER9 protein in the tapetum. Therefore, this work demonstrates that AtSEC31B plays a vital role in pollen wall development by regulating the secretory pathway of the tapetal cells.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new mouse model of Canavan leukodystrophy displays hearing impairment due to central nervous system dysmyelination
<p>Canavan disease is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the <i>ASPA</i> gene. This gene encodes the enzyme that converts N-acetylaspartate into acetate and aspartic acid. In Canavan disease, spongiform encephalopathy of the brain causes progressive mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation, motor deficit and death. We have isolated a mouse with a novel ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation in <i>Aspa</i>. This mutant, named <i>deaf14</i>, carries a c.516T>A mutation that is predicted to cause a p.Y172X protein truncation. No full-length ASPA protein is produced in <i>deaf14</i> brain and there is extensive spongy degeneration. Interestingly, we found that <i>deaf14</i> mice have an attenuated startle in response to loud noise. The first auditory brainstem response peak has normal latency and amplitude but peaks II, III, IV and V have increased latency and decreased amplitude in <i>deaf14</i> mice. Our work reveals a hitherto unappreciated pathology in a mouse model of Canavan disease, implying that auditory brainstem response testing could be used in diagnosis and to monitor the progression of this disease.</p>

Development of the prethalamus is crucial for thalamocortical projection formation and is regulated by Olig2
<p>Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) pass through the prethalamus in the first step of their neural circuit formation. Although it has been supposed that the prethalamus is an intermediate target for thalamocortical projection formation, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of this targeting. Here, we demonstrated the functional implications of the prethalamus in the formation of this neural circuit. We show that Olig2 transcription factor, which is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of prosomere 3, regulates prethalamus formation, and loss of Olig2 results in reduced prethalamus size in early development, which is accompanied by expansion of the thalamic eminence (TE). Extension of TCAs is disorganized in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> dorsal thalamus, and initial elongation of TCAs is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> forebrain. Microarray analysis demonstrated upregulation of several axon guidance molecules, including <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> basal forebrain. <i>In situ</i> hybridization showed that the prethalamus in the wild type excluded the expression of <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, whereas loss of Olig2 resulted in reduction of this Ephas-negative area and the corresponding expansion of the Ephas-positive TE. Dissociated cultures of thalamic progenitor cells demonstrated that substrate-bound EphA3 suppresses neurite extension from dorsal thalamic neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 is involved in correct formation of the prethalamus, which leads to exclusion of the EphA3-expressing region and is crucial for proper TCA formation. Our observation is the first report showing the molecular mechanisms underlying how the prethalamus acts on initial thalamocortical projection formation.</p>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth–Activated XBP1 Splicing in Endothelial Cells Is Crucial for Angiogenesis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Vascular endothelial cell growth factor plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis via regulating endothelial cell proliferation. The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is believed to be a signal transducer in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. It is unknown whether there is crosstalk between vascular endothelial cell growth factor signaling and XBP1 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We found that vascular endothelial cell growth factor induced the kinase insert domain receptor internalization and interaction through C-terminal domain with the unspliced XBP1 and the inositol requiring enzyme 1 α in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to inositol requiring enzyme 1 α phosphorylation and XBP1 mRNA splicing, which was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of kinase insert domain receptor. Spliced XBP1 regulated endothelial cell proliferation in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–dependent manner and modulated the cell size increase in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–independent manner. Knockdown of XBP1 or inositol requiring enzyme 1 α decreased endothelial cell proliferation via suppression of Akt/GSK3β phosphorylation, β-catenin nuclear translocation, and E2F2 expression. Endothelial cell–specific knockout of XBP1 (<i>XBP1ecko</i>) in mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed the retinal vasculogenesis in the first 2 postnatal weeks and impaired the angiogenesis triggered by ischemia. Reconstitution of XBP1 by Ad-XBP1s gene transfer significantly improved angiogenesis in ischemic tissue in <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice. Transplantation of bone marrow from wild-type o <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice could also slightly improve the foot blood reperfusion in ischemic <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>These results suggest that XBP1 can function via growth factor signaling pathways to regulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis.</p></sec>

Chemical Inhibition of NAT10 Corrects Defects of Laminopathic Cells
<sec><title>Remodelin Nuclear Defects</title><p>Deregulation of A-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong> proteins leads to disorganization of chromatin structure and misshapen nuclei, which are believed to underlie the pathologies of various human diseases, including the premature aging disorder Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and various cancers. <bold>Larrieu <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 527) developed a small molecule, Remodelin, that not only improved nuclear shape defects of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong> A/Câ€“depleted cells, HGPS cells, and aged normal cells, but also decreased the levels of a DNA damage marker and improved global cellular fitness.</p></sec>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels
<p>Fatigue failures create enormous risks for all engineered structures, as well as for human lives, motivating large safety factors in design and, thus, inefficient use of resources. Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue resistance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel microstructures are hierarchical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response. The exceptional properties enabled by this strategy provide guidance for all fatigue-resistant alloy design efforts.</p>

Xist recruits the X chromosome to the nuclear lamina to enable chromosome-wide silencing
<p>The Xist long noncoding RNA orchestrates X chromosome inactivation, a process that entails chromosome-wide silencing and remodeling of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the X chromosome. Yet, it remains unclear whether these changes in nuclear structure are mediated by Xist and whether they are required for silencing. Here, we show that Xist directly interacts with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong> B receptor, an integral component of the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>a, and that this interaction is required for Xist-mediated silencing by recruiting the inactive X to the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>a and by doing so enables Xist to spread to actively transcribed genes across the X. Our results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>a recruitment changes the 3D structure of DNA, enabling Xist and its silencing proteins to spread across the X to silence transcription.</p>

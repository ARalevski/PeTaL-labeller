The entorhinal cognitive map is attracted to goals
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> cells with their rigid hexagonal firing fields are thought to provide an invariant metric to the hippocampal cognitive map, yet environmental geometrical features have recently been shown to distort the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> structure. Given that the hippocampal role goes beyond space, we tested the influence of nonspatial information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> organization. We trained rats to daily learn three new reward locations on a cheeseboard maze while recording from the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal CA1 region. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> fields moved toward goal location, leading to long-lasting deformations of the entorhinal map. Therefore, distortions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> structure contribute to goal representation during both learning and recall, which demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> cells participate in mnemonic coding and do not merely provide a simple metric of space.</p>

Neural representations across species
<p>A plethora of studies in rodents have described spatially tuned neurons, including place cells in the hippocampus and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), suggesting a crucial role of the hippocampal formation in spatial navigation (<i>1</i>). Human studies have, in turn, shown that the hippocampal formation is involved in declarative memory (memories of facts and events) (<i>2</i>). What, then, is the function of the hippocampus? Is it involved in memory or in spatial navigation, or does it have a more general function that encompasses both? Several studies have shown that place cells remap, changing the location at which they respond, following geometrical changes in the environment, and that they can be modulated by nonspatial factors, according to the animals' specific tasks (<i>3</i>). These findings highlight the coding of cognitive components, challenging the notion that place cells represent an invariant spatial map. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> cells also realign with physical changes in the environment (<i>4</i>), the geometrical structure of their fields has been considered to provide a more invariant spatial representation. But do <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> cells encode cognitive aspects as well? On pages 1443 and 1447 of this issue, Boccara <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) and Butler <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), respectively, show that this is the case, providing compelling evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> cells are modulated by reward location. Complementing these studies, Baraduc <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) showed that variations in spatially tuned neurons in the monkey hippocampus are accompanied by a “schema” of the task. Together these studies provide insights on how neurons in the hippocampal formation go beyond purely spatial representations and are modulated by cognitive factors.</p>

Local transformations of the hippocampal cognitive map
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> cells are neurons active in multiple fields arranged in a hexagonal lattice and are thought to represent the “universal metric for space.” However, they become nonhomogeneously distorted in polarized enclosures, which challenges this view. We found that local changes to the configuration of the enclosure induce individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> fields to shift in a manner inversely related to their distance from the reconfigured boundary. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling. Shifts in simultaneously recorded colocalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> fields were strongly correlated, which suggests that the readout of the animal’s position might still be intact. Similar field shifts were also observed in place and boundary cells—albeit of greater magnitude and more pronounced closer to the reconfigured boundary—which suggests that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between these three different cell types.</p>

Small vulnerable sets determine large network cascades in power grids
<p>The understanding of cascading failures in complex systems has been hindered by the lack of realistic large-scale modeling and analysis that can account for variable system conditions. Using the North American power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong>, we identified, quantified, and analyzed the set of network components that are vulnerable to cascading failures under any out of multiple conditions. We show that the vulnerable set consists of a small but topologically central portion of the network and that large cascades are disproportionately more likely to be triggered by initial failures close to this set. These results elucidate aspects of the origins and causes of cascading failures relevant for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong> design and operation and demonstrate vulnerability analysis methods that are applicable to a wider class of cascade-prone networks.</p>

Representation of Three-Dimensional Space in the Hippocampus of Flying Bats
<sec><title>Bats, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grid</span></strong>s, and Oscillations</title><p>Nearly all animals move around in a three-dimensional (3D) world; however, very little is known about the neural circuitry underlying the representation of 3D space (see the Perspective by <bold>Barry and Doeller</bold>).

Optogenetic Dissection of Entorhinal-Hippocampal Functional Connectivity
<sec><title>From Grid to Place</title><p>Grid cells are considered one of the key sources for place-cell signals in the hippocampus. The entorhinal circuit also contains other functional cell types, but it is unclear which project to the place cells of the hippocampus. <bold>Zhang <i>et al.</i></bold> (10.1126/science.1232627, see the Perspective by <bold>Poucet and Sargolini</bold>) addressed this question using optogenetics and in vivo multi-electrode electrophysiology. Hippocampal cells received input from a broad spectrum of entorhinal neuronal cell types. Grid cells represented the biggest group of spatial inputs, but border cells, head-direction cells, and a large fraction of nonspatial cells also provided inputs. Thus, hippocampal circuits have local mechanisms for processing specific types of functional input from the entorhinal cortex to generate place-specific signals.</p></sec>

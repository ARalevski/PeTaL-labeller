Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is mainly occupied by homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polygon</span></strong>al starch from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) starches have been identified in some rice mutants. How these heterogeneous starches form remains unknown. A high-amylose rice line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i>starch branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> contains four heterogeneous starches: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polygon</span></strong>al, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch; these starches are regionally distributed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous starches in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of starch. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent regular changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous starches were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were mainly due to the spatial distribution of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in starch might remove steric hindrance and provide extra space for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

Single-component quasicrystalline nanocrystal superlattices through flexible polygon tiling rule
<p>Quasicrystalline superlattices (QC-SLs) generated from single-component colloidal building blocks have been predicted by computer simulations but are challenging to reproduce experimentally. We discovered that 10-fold QC-SLs could self-organize from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots with anisotropic patchiness. Transmission electron microscopy and tomography measurements allow structural reconstruction of the QC-SL from the nanoscale packing to the atomic-scale orientation alignments. The unique QC order leads to a tiling concept, the “flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polygon</span></strong> tiling rule,” that replicates the experimental observations. The keys for the single-component QC-SL formation were identified to be the anisotropic shape and patchiness of the building blocks and the assembly microscopic environment. Our discovery may spur the creation of various superstructures using anisotropic objects through an enthalpy-driven route.</p>

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal controls (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (control, HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (control, 6.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (control, 4.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (control, 14.0; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (control, 10.6; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> were higher than controls (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal thickening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD. These findings expand our understanding of the pathobiology of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in HF.</p></sec>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>age interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> regulation and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">buffer</span></strong>ing capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition, by which time the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> by 0.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition (0.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> unit drop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and a micro-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from the ce<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>alopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and an optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Activation of Lung p53 by Nutlin-3a Prevents and Reverses Experimental Pulmonary Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Induction of cellular senescence through activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is a new option for treating proliferative disorders. Nutlins prevent the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (murine double minute 2), a negative p53 regulator, from interacting with p53. We hypothesized that cell senescence induced by Nutlin-3a exerted therapeutic effects in pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) by limiting the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Nutlin-3a treatment of cultured human PA-SMCs resulted in cell growth arrest with the induction of senescence but not apoptosis; increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylated p53 protein levels; and expression of p53 target genes including p21, Bax, BTG2, and MDM2.

Nutlin-3a treatment also partially reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in chronically hypoxic or transgenic mice overexpressing the serotonin-transporter in SMCs (SM22-5HTT+ mice). In these mouse models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, Nutlin-3a markedly increased senescent p21-stained PA-SMCs; lung p53, p21, and MDM2 protein levels; and p21, Bax, PUMA, BTG2, and MDM2 mRNA levels; but induced only minor changes in control mice without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Marked MDM2 immunostaining was seen in both mouse and human remodeled pulmonary vessels, supporting the use of Nutlins as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-targeted therapy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> prevention or reversal by Nutlin-3a required lung p53 stabilization and increased p21 expression, as indicated by the absence of Nutlin-3a effects in hypoxia-exposed p53<sup>−/−</sup> and p21<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Nutlin-3a may hold promise as a prosenescence treatment targeting PA-SMCs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p>Acidic conditions, such as those inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ responds to a mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ is thought to be sufficient to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP under mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> conditions but not for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP by stimulating auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ, thereby increasing the amount of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>odonor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP activation in a strain bearing a form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ that is not responsive to acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP activation requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to detect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and UgtL to amplify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ response.

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of melanin increases skin pigmentation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. Melanin production depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled pigmentation by increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls pigmentation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased pigmentation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, which is more active at basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and melanin production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor. Last, we identified sAC inhibitors as a new class of drugs that increase melanosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and pigmentation in vivo, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacologic inhibition of this pathway may affect skin cancer risk or pigmentation conditions.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma

This pushes laboratory studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties.

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> or alkaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> relative to acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> but supported high transport rates at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> status was confirmed by echocardiogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p></sec>

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo design of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the design of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to design <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>obic interactions. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.</p>

Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus
<p>The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for vaccine design against these threats to global health.</p>

The geologic history of seawater pH

A lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in Earth’s early oceans likely affected the kinetics of chemical reactions associated with the origin of life, the energetics of early metabolisms, and climate through the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> between the oceans and atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ere.</p>

K<sup>+</sup> Efflux Antiporters 4, 5, and 6 Mediate pH and K<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis in Endomembrane Compartments
<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi network, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> close to wild-type values. Together, these data signify that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are endosomal K<sup>+</sup> transporters functioning in maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and ion homeostasis in the endomembrane network.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-na<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these inhibitors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent inhibitor compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Cancer-associated arginine-to-histidine mutations confer a gain in pH sensing to mutant proteins
<p>The intracellular pH (pHi) of most cancers is constitutively higher than that of normal cells and enhances proliferation and cell survival. We found that increased pHi enabled the tumorigenic behaviors caused by somatic arginine-to-histidine mutations, which are frequent in cancer and confer pH sensing not seen with wild-type proteins. Experimentally raising the pHi increased the activity of R776H mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-R776H), thereby increasing proliferation and causing transformation in fibroblasts. An Arg-to-Gly mutation did not confer these effects. Molecular dynamics simulations of EGFR suggested that decreased protonation of His<sup>776</sup> at high pH causes conformational changes in the αC helix that may stabilize the active form of the kinase. An Arg-to-His, but not Arg-to-Lys, mutation in the transcription factor p53 (p53-R273H) decreased its transcriptional activity and attenuated the DNA damage response in fibroblasts and breast cancer cells with high pHi. Lowering pHi attenuated the tumorigenic effects of both EGFR-R776H and p53-R273H. Our data suggest that some somatic mutations may confer a fitness advantage to the higher pHi of cancer cells.</p>

Potent peptidic fusion inhibitors of influenza virus
<p>Influenza therapeutics with new targets and mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat potential pandemics, emerging viruses, and constantly mutating strains in circulation.

The peptide design was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114). The optimized peptides exhibit nanomolar affinity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ization against influenza A group 1 viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and avian H5N1 strains. The peptide inhibitors bind to the highly conserved stem epitope and block the low pH–induced conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. These peptidic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate the development of new small molecule– and peptide-based therapeutics against influenza virus.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

Structure of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor module of Trio in an autoinhibited conformation reveals its oncogenic potential
<p>The C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) module of Trio (TrioC) transfers signals from the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins to the small guanosine tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atase (GTPase) RhoA, enabling Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) to control downstream events, such as cell motility and gene transcription. This conserved signal transduction axis is crucial for tumor growth in uveal melanoma. Previous studies indicate that the GEF activity of the TrioC module is autoinhibited, with release of autoinhibition upon Gα<sub>q/11</sub> binding. Here, we determined the crystal structure of TrioC in its basal state and found that the pleckstrin homology (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) domain interacts with the Dbl homology (DH) domain in a manner that occludes the Rho GTPase binding site, thereby suggesting the molecular basis of TrioC autoinhibition. Biochemical and bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysical assays revealed that disruption of the autoinhibited conformation destabilized and activated the TrioC module in vitro. Last, mutations in the DH-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> interface found in patients with cancer activated TrioC and, in the context of full-length Trio, led to increased abundance of guanosine tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate–bound RhoA (RhoA·GTP) in human cells. These mutations increase mitogenic signaling through the RhoA axis and, therefore, may represent cancer drivers operating in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-independent manner.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria.

We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate group to lipid A. Later, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N.

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium.

Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second.

<p>Networks with a modular structure are expected to have a lower risk of global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test the effect of modularity on the response to perturbation. We perturbed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this perturbation, both within and between modules. Our results show the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">buffer</span></strong>ing capacity of modular networks. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">buffer</span></strong>ing effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.</p>

The complex effects of ocean acidification on the prominent N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacterium <i>Trichodesmium</i>
<p>Acidification of seawater caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is anticipated to influence the growth of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)–fixing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ytoplankton, which contribute a large fraction of primary production in the tropical and subtropical ocean. We found that growth and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation of the ubiquitous cyanobacterium <i>Trichodesmium</i> decreased under acidified conditions, notwithstanding a beneficial effect of high CO<sub>2</sub>. Acidification resulted in low cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and reduced N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates despite elevated nitrogenase concentrations. Low cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> required increased proton pumping across the thylakoid membrane and elevated adenosine tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate production. These requirements were not satisfied under field or experimental iron-limiting conditions, which greatly amplified the negative effect of acidification.</p>

A nontoxic pain killer designed by modeling of pathological receptor conformations
<p>Indiscriminate activation of opioid receptors provides pain relief but also severe central and intestinal side effects. We hypothesized that exploiting pathological (rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological) conformation dynamics of opioid receptor-ligand interactions might yield ligands without adverse actions. By computer simulations at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, a hallmark of injured tissue, we designed an agonist that, because of its low acid dissociation constant, selectively activates peri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eral μ-opioid receptors at the source of pain generation. Unlike the conventional opioid fentanyl, this agonist showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-sensitive binding, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein) subunit dissociation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and adenosine 3′,5′-mono<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate inhibition in vitro<i>.</i> It produced injury-restricted analgesia in rats with different types of inflammatory pain without exhibiting respiratory depression, sedation, constipation, or addiction potential.</p>

Rapid development of a DNA vaccine for Zika virus
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified as a cause of congenital disease during the explosive outbreak in the Americas and Caribbean that began in 2015. Because of the ongoing fetal risk from endemic disease and travel-related exposures, a vaccine to prevent viremia in women of childbearing age and their partners is imperative. We found that vaccination with DNA expressing the premembrane and envelope proteins of ZIKV was immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, and protection against viremia after ZIKV challenge correlated with serum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing activity. These data not only indicate that DNA vaccination could be a successful approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of vaccine-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing activity that prevents viremia after acute infection.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cation/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular ion homeostasis and are critical for cell expansion and plant stress acclimation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Additional K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cation/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cation/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cation homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty acids from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty acids accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty acids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atidic acid, suggesting a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">buffer</span></strong> function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty acid overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty acids remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty acid turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> or nearly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we em<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>asize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">buffer</span></strong>ed environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">buffer</span></strong>ed environments.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> dependent and maximal at ~<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Here, we utilize a spleen transcriptome for the house finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>), an emerging model for sexual selection and disease ecology, together with previously sequenced avian genomes (chicken, turkey, and zebra finch), to investigate lineage-specific adaptations within birds. An analysis of 4,398 orthologous genes revealed a significantly higher ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions and significantly higher GC content in passerines than in galliforms, an observation deviating from strictly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> expectations but consistent with an effect of biased gene conversion on the evolutionary rate in passerines. These data also showed that genes exhibiting signs of positive selection and fast evolution in passerines have functional roles related to fat metabolism, neurodevelopment, and ion binding.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Prevalence of Subclinical Coronary Artery Disease in Masters Endurance Athletes With a Low Atherosclerotic Risk Profile
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies in middle-age and older (masters) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es with atherosclerotic risk factors for coronary artery disease report higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores compared with sedentary individuals. Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed 152 masters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC score. Male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.15; <i>P</i>=0.016); 15 (14%) male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es, 7 had a pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most lifelong masters endurance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es with a low atherosclerotic risk profile have normal CAC scores. Male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es are more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es indicates potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms for plaque formation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>ic versus sedentary men. Coronary plaques are more abundant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es, whereas their stable nature could mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Effects of Performance-Enhancing Drugs
<p>Exercise and competitive sports should be associated with a wide range of health benefits with the potential to inspire a positive community health legacy. However, the reputation of sports is being threatened by an ever-expanding armamentarium of agents with real or perceived benefits in performance enhancement. In addition to the injustice of unfair advantage for dishonest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es, significant potential health risks are associated with performance-enhancing drugs. Performance-enhancing drugs may have an effect on the cardiovascular system by means of directly altering the myocardium, vasculature, and metabolism. However, less frequently considered is the potential for indirect effects caused through enabling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es to push beyond normal physiological limits with the potential consequence of exercise-induced arrhythmias. This review will summarize the known health effects of PEDs but will also focus on the potentially greater health threat posed by the covert search for performance-enhancing agents that have yet to be recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency. History has taught us that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es are subjected to unmonitored trials with experimental drugs that have little or no established efficacy or safety data. One approach to decrease drug abuse in sports would be to accept that there is a delay from when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es start experimenting with novel agents to the time when authorities become aware of these drugs. This provides a window of opportunity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es to exploit with relative immunity. It could be argued that all off-label use of any agent should be deemed illegal.</p>

Successful return to sports in athletes following non-operative management of acute isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report the outcome of the non-operative   treatment of high-grade posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries,   particularly Hughston grade III injuries, which have not previously   been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a prospective study involving 46 consecutive patients   who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es with MRI-confirmed isolated PCL injuries presenting   within four weeks of injury. All had Hughston grade II (25 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es)   or III (21 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es) injuries. Our non-operative treatment regimen   involved initial bracing, followed by an individualised rehabilitation   programme determined by the symptoms and physical signs. The patients   were reviewed until they had returned to sports-specific training,   and were reviewed again at a mean of 5.2 years (3 to 9).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time to return to sports-specific training was 10.6   weeks and the mean time to return to full competitive sport was   16.4 weeks (10 to 40). A total of 42 patients (91.3%) were playing   at the same or higher level of sport two years after the injury,   with a mean Tegner activity score of 9 (5 to 10). At five years,   32 patients (69.5%) were playing at the same or higher level of   sport, and 38 patients (82.6%) were playing at a competitive level,   with a mean Tegner activity score of 9 (5 to 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Medium-term review of a series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es suggests that commencing   the non-operative management of isolated, Hughston grade II and   III PCL injuries within four weeks of injury gives excellent functional   outcomes with a high proportion returning to the same or higher level   of sport.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:774–8.</p></sec>

Physiological Right Ventricular Adaptation in Elite Athletes of African and Afro-Caribbean Origin
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Regular, intensive exercise results in physiological biventricular cardiac adaptation. Ethnicity is an established determinant of left ventricular remodeling; black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es (BAs) exhibit more profound LV hypertrophy than white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es (WAs). Right ventricular (RV) remodeling has not been characterized in BAs, although the issue is pertinent because BAs commonly exhibit ECG anomalies that resemble arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Between 2006 and 2012, 300 consecutive BAs (n=243 males) from 25 sporting disciplines were evaluated by use of ECG and echocardiography. Results were compared with 375 WAs and 153 sedentary control subjects (n=69 blacks). There were no ethnic differences between RV parameters in control subjects. Both BAs and WAs exhibited greater RV dimensions than control subjects. RV dimensions were marginally smaller in BAs than in WAs (proximal outflow tract, 30.9±5.5 versus 32.8±5.3 mm, <i>P</i><0.001; longitudinal dimension, 86.6±9.5 versus 89.8±9.6 mm, <i>P</i><0.001), although only 2.3% of variation was attributable to ethnicity. RV enlargement compatible with diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy was frequently observed (proximal outflow tract ≥32 mm; 45.0% of BAs, 58.5% of WAs). Anterior T-wave inversion was present in 14.3% of BAs versus 3.7% of WAs (<i>P</i><0.001). Marked RV enlargement with concomitant anterior T-wave inversion was observed in 3.0% of BAs versus 0.3% of WAs (<i>P</i>=0.005). Further investigation did not diagnose arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy in any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Physiological RV enlargement is commonly observed in both black and white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es. The impact of ethnicity is minimal, which obviates the need for race-specific RV reference values. However, in the context of frequent ECG repolarization anomalies in BAs, the potential for erroneous diagnosis of arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is considerably greater in this ethnic group.</p></sec>

Relationship Between Lifelong Exercise Volume and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Athletes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, there is debate on the dose-response relationship of exercise and cardiovascular disease outcomes and whether high volumes of exercise may accelerate coronary atherosclerosis. We aimed to determine the relationship between lifelong exercise volumes and coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Middle-aged men engaged in competitive or recreational leisure sports underwent a noncontrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan to assess coronary artery calcification (CAC) and plaque characteristics. Participants reported lifelong exercise history patterns. Exercise volumes were multiplied by metabolic equivalent of task (MET) scores to calculate MET-minutes per week. Participants’ activity was categorized as <1000, 1000 to 2000, or >2000 MET-min/wk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 284 men (age, 55±7 years) were included. CAC was present in 150 of 284 participants (53%) with a median CAC score of 35.8 (interquartile range, 9.3–145.8). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es with a lifelong exercise volume >2000 MET-min/wk (n=75) had a significantly higher CAC score (9.4 [interquartile range, 0–60.9] versus 0 [interquartile range, 0–43.5]; <i>P</i>=0.02) and prevalence of CAC (68%; adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>adjusted</sub>]=3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–6.6) and plaque (77%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=3.3; 95% CI, 1.6–7.1) compared with <1000 MET-min/wk (n=88; 43% and 56%, respectively). Very vigorous intensity exercise (≥9 MET) was associated with CAC (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=1.47; 95% CI, 1.14–1.91) and plaque (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=1.56; 95% CI, 1.17–2.08). Among participants with CAC>0, there was no difference in CAC score (<i>P</i>=0.20), area (<i>P</i>=0.21), density (<i>P</i>=0.25), and regions of interest (<i>P</i>=0.20) across exercise volume groups. Among participants with plaque, the most active group (>2000 MET-min/wk) had a lower prevalence of mixed plaques (48% versus 69%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=0.35; 95% CI, 0.15–0.85) and more often had only calcified plaques (38% versus 16%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=3.57; 95% CI, 1.28–9.97) compared with the least active group (<1000 MET-min/wk).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Participants in the >2000 MET-min/wk group had a higher prevalence of CAC and atherosclerotic plaques. The most active group, however, had a more benign composition of plaques, with fewer mixed plaques and more often only calcified plaques. These observations may explain the increased longevity typical of endurance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">athlet</span></strong>es despite the presence of more coronary atherosclerotic plaque in the most active participants.</p></sec>

Soluble gp130 prevents interleukin-6 and interleukin-11 cluster signaling but not intracellular autocrine responses
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine of the IL-6 family, members of which signal through a complex of a cytokine-specific receptor and the signal-transducing subunit gp130. The interaction of IL-6 with the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130 stimulates “classic signaling,” whereas the binding of IL-6 and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e version of the IL-6R to gp130 stimulates “trans-signaling.” Alternatively, “cluster signaling” occurs when membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes on transmitter cells activate gp130 receptors on neighboring receiver cells. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e form of gp130 (sgp130) is a selective trans-signaling inhibitor, but it does not affect classic signaling. We demonstrated that the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e gp130 with natural and synthetic membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes inhibited IL-6 cluster signaling. Similarly, IL-11 cluster signaling through the IL-11R to gp130 was also inhibited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e gp130. However, autocrine classic and trans-signaling was not inhibited by extracellular inhibitors such as sgp130 or gp130 antibodies. Together, our results suggest that autocrine IL-6 signaling may occur intracellularly.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase separation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase separation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and transport within and between plant tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a nodule-specific citrate transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 transported citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate transport into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p>Sugars play important roles in plant growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several sugar transporter and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced sugar accumulation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the sugar transporter and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic plants produced more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the accumulation of sucrose and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and sugar transporter genes to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugar accumulation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation in plants.</p>

Soluble and Membrane-Bound β-Glucosidases Are Involved in Trimming the Xyloglucan Backbone
<p>In many flowering plants, xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Xyloglucan can be degraded by a suite of exoglycosidases that remove specific sugars. In this work, we show that the xyloglucan backbone, formed by (1→4)-linked β-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl residues, can be attacked by two different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) β-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 3. While BGLC1 (At5g20950; for β-glucosidase active against xyloglucan 1) is responsible for all or most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e activity, BGLC3 (At5g04885) is usually a membrane-anchored protein. Mutations in these two genes, whether on their own or combined with mutations in other exoglycosidase genes, resulted in the accumulation of partially digested xyloglucan subunits, such as GXXG, GXLG, or GXFG. While a mutation in <i>BGLC1</i> had significant effects on its own, lack of <i>BGLC3</i> had only minor effects. On the other hand, double <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> mutants revealed a synergistic interaction that supports a role for membrane-bound BGLC3 in xyloglucan metabolism. In addition, <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> was complemented by overexpression of either <i>BGLC1</i> or <i>BGLC3</i>. In overexpression lines, BGLC3 activity was concentrated in a microsome-enriched fraction but also was present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e form. Finally, both genes were generally expressed in the same cell types, although, in some cases, <i>BGLC3</i> was expressed at earlier stages than <i>BGLC1</i>. We propose that functional specialization could explain the separate localization of both enzymes, as a membrane-bound β-glucosidase could specifically digest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e xyloglucan without affecting the wall-bound polymer.</p>

Simulated browsing affects leaf shedding phenology and litter quality of oak and birch saplings
<p>Herbivore effects on leaf litter can have a strong impact on ecosystem nutrient cycling. Although such effects are well described for insect herbivory, research on the impacts of browsing by mammalian herbivores on leaf litter dynamics and nutrient cycling has been more limited, particularly at the level of the individual plant. Clipping treatments (66% shoot removal twice, plus unclipped) were applied to analyse the effect of browsing on the phenology (start date and pattern of leaf shedding) and leaf litter quality (nitrogen (N), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars, starch and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, plus C : N ratios) of <i>Betula pubescens</i> Ehrh. and <i>Quercus petraea</i> [Matt.] Liebl. saplings. Clipping decreased leaf litter biomass and delayed leaf senescence and shedding, but did not change the phenological timing of litterfall between senescence and shedding. The quality of leaf litter of both species was increased by simulated browsing, through an increase in N and carbohydrate concentrations (mainly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars) and a decreased C : N ratio. This is the first evidence we are aware of that browsing may cause changes in leaf shedding phenology, delaying the process without altering its pattern. Our results also indicate that simulated browsing increases the quality of leaf litter. However, the potential positive effect of browsing on N cycling through litter quality may be offset by its negative impact on the amount of N shed per tree.</p>

IL-33 and ST2 mediate FAK-dependent antitumor immune evasion through transcriptional networks
<p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates tumor cell–intrinsic behaviors that promote tumor growth and metastasis. We previously showed that FAK also induces the expression of inflammatory genes that inhibit antitumor immunity in the microenvironment. We identified a crucial, previously unknown role for the dual-function cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) in FAK-dependent immune evasion. In murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, specifically nuclear FAK enhanced the expression of the genes encoding IL-33, the chemokine CCL5, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e, secreted form of the IL-33 receptor, called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e ST2 (sST2). The abundance of IL-33 and CCL5 was increased in FAK-positive SCC cells but not in normal keratinocytes. IL-33 associated with FAK in the nucleus, and the FAK–IL-33 complex interacted with a network of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators, including TAF9, WDR82, and BRD4, which promote the activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its induction of genes encoding chemokines, including CCL5. We did not detect secretion of IL-33 from FAK-positive SCC cells; thus, we propose that the increased production and secretion of sST2 likely sequesters IL-33 secreted by other cell types within the tumor environment, thus blocking its stimulatory effects on infiltrating host immune cells. Depleting FAK, IL-33, or sST2 from SCC cells before implantation induced tumor regression in syngeneic mice, except when CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were co-depleted. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how FAK controls the tumor immune environment, namely, through a transcriptional regulatory network mediated by nuclear IL-33. Targeting this axis may boost antitumor immunity in patients.</p>

Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyanobacteria are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid membranes, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other bacteria. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of hydrocarbons in the environment. All sequenced cyanobacteria encode hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that hydrocarbon-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a minor reduction in energy transfer between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e light harvesting phycobilisome complex and membrane-bound photosystems was observed. Hydrocarbons were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes. Modeling of membranes suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the lipid bilayer, potentially promoting membrane flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking hydrocarbons exhibit reduced thylakoid membrane curvature compared to wild type. We propose that hydrocarbons may have a role in inducing the flexibility in membranes required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e and membrane bound proteins. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests hydrocarbons may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. Proton translocation through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> region turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e F<sub>1</sub> region. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> region have illustrated how this rotation leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how proton translocation produces the rotation has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic model for the F<sub>O</sub> region. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the protons travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

Structural basis of the redox switches in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-reducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> (oxidized form of NAD:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e [NiFe]-hydrogenase (SH) is phylogenetically related to NADH (reduced form of NAD<sup>+</sup>):quinone oxidoreductase (complex I), but the geometrical arrangements of the subunits and Fe–S clusters are unclear. Here, we describe the crystal structures of SH in the oxidized and reduced states. The cluster arrangement is similar to that of complex I, but the subunits orientation is not, which supports the hypothesis that subunits evolved as prebuilt modules. The oxidized active site includes a six-coordinate Ni, which is unprecedented for hydrogenases, whose coordination geometry would prevent O<sub>2</sub> from approaching. In the reduced state showing the normal active site structure without a physiological electron acceptor, the flavin mononucleotide cofactor is dissociated, which may be caused by the oxidation state change of nearby Fe–S clusters and may suppress production of reactive oxygen species.</p>

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer formulations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials. The patterned materials can be metals, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth compositions. No organic impurities are present in the patterned layers, which helps achieve good electronic and optical properties. The conductivity, carrier mobility, dielectric, and luminescence properties of optically patterned layers are on par with the properties of state-of-the-art solution-processed materials. The ability to directly pattern all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

Macrophage function in tissue repair and remodeling requires IL-4 or IL-13 with apoptotic cells
<p>Tissue repair is a subset of a broad repertoire of interleukin-4 (IL-4)– and IL-13–dependent host responses during helminth infection. Here we show that IL-4 or IL-13 alone was not sufficient, but IL-4 or IL-13 together with apoptotic cells induced the tissue repair program in macrophages. Genetic ablation of sensors of apoptotic cells impaired the proliferation of tissue-resident macrophages and the induction of anti-inflammatory and tissue repair genes in the lungs after helminth infection or in the gut after induction of colitis. By contrast, the recognition of apoptotic cells was dispensable for cytokine-dependent induction of pattern recognition receptor, cell adhesion, or chemotaxis genes in macrophages. Detection of apoptotic cells can therefore spatially compartmentalize or prevent premature or ectopic activity of pleiotropic, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-13.</p>

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells.</p>

ATP controls the crowd

On page 753 of this issue, Patel <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) propose a previously unknown function for ATP in maintaining protein solubility and preventing macromolecular aggregation. They show that at physiologic concentrations (2 to 8 mM), the physical properties of ATP alone enable it to dissolve liquid-liquid phase-separated droplets and amyloid fibers. These findings suggest an additional way for cells to use ATP to maintain proteostasis in the crowded cytoplasm and also fine-tune the material properties of nonmembrane-bound organelles and the cell interior in general.</p>

The cytotoxic <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> PSMα3 reveals a cross-α amyloid-like fibril

PSMα3 formed elongated fibrils that shared the morphological and tinctorial characteristics of canonical cross-β eukaryotic amyloids. However, the crystal structure of full-length PSMα3, solved de novo at 1.45 angstrom resolution, revealed a distinctive “cross-α” amyloid-like architecture, in which amphipathic α helices stacked perpendicular to the fibril axis into tight self-associating sheets. The cross-α fibrillation of PSMα3 facilitated cytotoxicity, suggesting that this assembly mode underlies function in <i>S. aureus</i>.</p>

A bacterial global regulator forms a prion
<p>Prions are self-propagating protein aggregates that act as protein-based elements of inheritance in fungi. Although prevalent in eukaryotes, prions have not been identified in bacteria. Here we found that a bacterial protein, transcription terminator Rho of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> (<i>Cb</i>-Rho), could form a prion. We identified a candidate prion-forming domain (cPrD) in <i>Cb</i>-Rho and showed that it conferred amyloidogenicity on <i>Cb</i>-Rho and could functionally replace the PrD of a yeast prion-forming protein. Furthermore, its cPrD enabled <i>Cb</i>-Rho to access alternative conformations in <i>Escherichia coli</i>—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e form that terminated transcription efficiently and an aggregated, self-propagating prion form that was functionally compromised. The prion form caused genome-wide changes in the transcriptome. Thus, <i>Cb</i>-Rho functions as a protein-based element of inheritance in bacteria, suggesting that the emergence of prions predates the evolutionary split between eukaryotes and bacteria.</p>

The ATG conjugation systems are important for degradation of the inner autophagosomal membrane
<p>In macroautophagy, cytoplasmic contents are sequestered into the double-membrane autophagosome, which fuses with the lysosome to become the autolysosome. It has been thought that the autophagy-related (ATG) conjugation systems are required for autophagosome formation. Here, we found that autophagosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) syntaxin 17–positive autophagosome-like structures could be generated even in the absence of the ATG conjugation systems, although at a reduced rate. These syntaxin 17–positive structures could further fuse with lysosomes, but degradation of the inner autophagosomal membrane was significantly delayed. Accordingly, autophagic activity in ATG conjugation–deficient cells was strongly suppressed. We suggest that the ATG conjugation systems, which are likely required for the closure (i.e., fission) of the autophagosomal edge, are not absolutely essential for autolysosome formation but are important for efficient degradation of the inner autophagosomal membrane.</p>

Formaldehyde stabilization facilitates lignin monomer production during biomass depolymerization

These yields were three to seven times those obtained without formaldehyde, which prevented lignin condensation by forming 1,3-dioxane structures with lignin side-chain hydroxyl groups. By depolymerizing cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin separately, monomer yields were between 76 and 90 mole % for these three major biomass fractions.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance

However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial plants form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the plant and enhance the plant’s uptake of mineral nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host plants; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that tomato plants have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved plant K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

How SEC11 binding is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE binding site. Here, we identify a second binding motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 binding independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> fragment. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex assembly.</p>

OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast
<p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) blast. SNAREs (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen resistance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host resistance to rice blast are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-resistant rice landrace Heikezijing and the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced resistance to blast. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the resistant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i>::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at rice blast penetration sites in transgenic rice, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice blast. Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in rice blast resistance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking.</p>

Characterization of CRISPR Mutants Targeting Genes Modulating Pectin Degradation in Ripening Tomato
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a globally important crop with an economic value in the tens of billions of dollars, and a significant supplier of essential vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals in the human diet. Shelf life is a key quality trait related to alterations in cuticle properties and remodeling of the fruit cell walls. Studies with transgenic tomato plants undertaken over the last 20 years have indicated that a range of pectin-degrading enzymes are involved in cell wall remodeling. These studies usually involved silencing of only a single gene and it has proved difficult to compare the effects of silencing these genes across the different experimental systems. Here we report the generation of CRISPR-based mutants in the ripening-related genes encoding the pectin-degrading enzymes pectate lyase (PL), polygalacturonase 2a (PG2a), and β-galactanase (TBG4). Comparison of the physiochemical properties of the fruits from a range of <i>PL</i>, <i>PG2a</i>, and <i>TBG4</i> CRISPR lines demonstrated that only mutations in <i>PL</i> resulted in firmer fruits, although mutations in <i>PG2a</i> and <i>TBG4</i> influenced fruit color and weight. Pectin localization, distribution, and solubility in the pericarp cells of the CRISPR mutant fruits were investigated using the monoclonal antibody probes LM19 to deesterified homogalacturonan, INRA-RU1 to rhamnogalacturonan I, LM5 to β-1,4-galactan, and LM6 to arabinan epitopes, respectively. The data indicate that PL, PG2a, and TBG4 act on separate cell wall domains and the importance of cellulose microfibril-associated pectin is reflected in its increased occurrence in the different mutant lines.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) transporters to acquire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

SNAREs SYP121 and SYP122 Mediate the Secretion of Distinct Cargo Subsets
<p>SNARE (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins drive vesicle fusion and contribute to homoeostasis, pathogen defense, cell expansion, and growth in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), two homologous Qa-SNAREs, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS121 (SYP121) and SYP122, facilitate the majority of secretory traffic to the plasma membrane, and the single mutants are indistinguishable from wild-type plants in the absence of stress, implying a redundancy in their functions. Nonetheless, several studies suggest differences among the secretory cargo of these SNAREs. To address this issue, we conducted an analysis of the proteins secreted by cultured wild-type, <i>syp121</i>, and <i>syp122</i> mutant Arabidopsis seedlings. Here, we report that a number of cargo proteins were associated differentially with traffic mediated by SYP121 and SYP122. The data also indicated important overlaps between the SNAREs. Therefore, we conclude that the two Qa-SNAREs mediate distinct but complementary secretory pathways during vegetative plant growth.</p>

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentration of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is toxic to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene synthesis, leading to plant senescence.</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are products of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older leaves of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older leaves when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older leaves of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger leaves of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type leaves, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-degraded products from older to younger leaves. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older leaves of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> leaves compared with wild-type leaves indicated a need for nitrate assimilation products. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-degraded N from older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein degradation in older leaves of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many preproteins that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast preproteins contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for proteins containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e proteins through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast proteins affect protein translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing proteins.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How sugar transporters regulate sugar accumulation in fruits is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-concentration Suc. Accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e sugars in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described sugar content quantitative trait locus, which contains a putative <i>Tonoplast Sugar Transporter</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and accumulation of sugars in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit sugar content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most sugar-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a sugar-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a sugar-responsive cis‐element within the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter, which contains the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase sugar sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other vegetable and fruit crops.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between organelles is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, transport, docking, and fusion. In animals, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of animal SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root hair development. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair development and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and development and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell developmental processes via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

Manipulation of a Senescence-Associated Gene Improves Fleshy Fruit Yield
<p>Senescence is the process that marks the end of a leaf’s lifespan. As it progresses, the massive macromolecular catabolism dismantles the chloroplasts and, consequently, decreases the photosynthetic capacity of these organs. Thus, senescence manipulation is a strategy to improve plant yield by extending the leaf’s photosynthetically active window of time. However, it remains to be addressed if this approach can improve fleshy fruit production and nutritional quality. One way to delay senescence initiation is by regulating key transcription factors (TFs) involved in triggering this process, such as the NAC TF ORESARA1 (ORE1). Here, three senescence-related NAC TFs from tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) were identified, namely SlORE1S02, SlORE1S03, and SlORE1S06. All three genes were shown to be responsive to senescence-inducing stimuli and posttranscriptionally regulated by the microRNA <i>miR164</i>. Moreover, the encoded proteins interacted physically with the chloroplast maintenance-related TF SlGLKs. This characterization led to the selection of a putative tomato <i>ORE1</i> as target gene for RNA interference knockdown. Transgenic lines showed delayed senescence and enhanced carbon assimilation that, ultimately, increased the number of fruits and their total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e solid content. Additionally, the fruit nutraceutical composition was enhanced. In conclusion, these data provide robust evidence that the manipulation of leaf senescence is an effective strategy for yield improvement in fleshy fruit-bearing species.</p>

OsHAD1, a Haloacid Dehalogenase-Like APase, Enhances Phosphate Accumulation
<p>Phosphorus (P) deficiency limits plant growth and yield. Since plants can absorb only the inorganic form of P (Pi), a large portion of soil P (organic and inorganic P complexes) remains unused. Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2-regulated, novel low-Pi-responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, <i>OsHAD1</i>. While OsHAD1 is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activities, it showed little homology with other known low-Pi-responsive HAD superfamily members. Recombinant OsHAD1 is active at acidic pH and dephosphorylates a broad range of organic and inorganic P-containing substrates, including phosphorylated serine and sodium phytate. Exogenous application of recombinant OsHAD1 protein in growth medium supplemented with phytate led to marked increases in growth and total P content of Pi-deficient wild-type rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>OsHAD1</i> in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, and total and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e P contents in Pi-deficient transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as a restricted Pi source. Gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed enhanced Pi starvation responses, such as up-regulation of multiple genes involved in Pi uptake and solubilization, accumulation of organic acids, enhanced secretory phosphatase activity, and depletion of ATP in overexpression lines as compared with the wild type. To elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of OsHAD1, we performed in vitro pull-down assays, which revealed the association of OsHAD1 with protein kinases such as OsNDPKs. We conclude that, besides dephosphorylation of cellular organic P, OsHAD1 in coordination with kinases may regulate the phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi homeostasis under limited Pi supply.</p>

The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between vegetative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility
<p>Lignin, a ubiquitous phenylpropanoid polymer in vascular plant cell walls, is derived primarily from oxidative couplings of monolignols (<i>p</i>-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols). It was discovered recently that a wide range of grasses, including cereals, utilize a member of the flavonoids, tricin (3′,5′-dimethoxyflavone), as a natural comonomer with monolignols for cell wall lignification. Previously, we established that cytochrome P450 93G1 is a flavone synthase II (OsFNSII) indispensable for the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e tricin-derived metabolites in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Here, our tricin-deficient <i>fnsII</i> mutant was analyzed further with an emphasis on its cell wall structure and properties. The mutant is similar in growth to wild-type control plants with normal vascular morphology. Chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance structural analyses demonstrated that the mutant lignin is completely devoid of tricin, indicating that FNSII activity is essential for the deposition of tricin-bound lignin in rice cell walls. The mutant also showed substantially reduced lignin content with decreased syringyl/guaiacyl lignin unit composition. Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin, which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII. The <i>fnsII</i> mutant was further revealed to have enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency, suggesting that the cell wall recalcitrance of grass biomass may be reduced through the manipulation of the flavonoid monomer supply for lignification.</p>

Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Altering Pollen Soluble Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity<xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates and protein kinases involved is vital to understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate biological function in eukaryotic cells. Pyrophosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) to inorganic phosphate P<sub>i</sub>, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic phosphate. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two pollen-expressed sPPases, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, from the flowering plant <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation sites to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these pollen sPPases. Despite the absence of reports in the literature on mapping phosphorylation sites on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes identified a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p26.1a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2.5-fold at pH 6.8 and 52% in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key sites can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events. As sPPases are essential for many metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells, our findings identify the phosphorylation of sPPases as a potential master regulatory mechanism that could be used to attenuate metabolism.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

An Oxalyl-CoA Synthetase Is Involved in Oxalate Degradation and Aluminum Tolerance
<p>Acyl Activating Enzyme3 (AAE3) was identified to be involved in the catabolism of oxalate, which is critical for seed development and defense against fungal pathogens. However, the role of AAE3 protein in abiotic stress responses is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of rice bean (<i>Vigna umbellata</i>) VuAAE3 in Al tolerance. Recombinant VuAAE3 protein has specific activity against oxalate, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 121 ± 8.2 µ<sc>m</sc> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 7.7 ± 0.88 µmol min<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup> protein, indicating it functions as an oxalyl-CoA synthetase. VuAAE3-GFP localization suggested that this enzyme is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e protein with no specific subcellular localization. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and <i>VuAAE3</i> promoter-GUS reporter analysis showed that the expression induction of <i>VuAAE3</i> is mainly confined to rice bean root tips. Accumulation of oxalate was induced rapidly by Al stress in rice bean root tips, and exogenous application of oxalate resulted in the inhibition of root elongation and <i>VuAAE3</i> expression induction, suggesting that oxalate accumulation is involved in Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, overexpression of VuAAE3 in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) resulted in the increase of Al tolerance, which was associated with the decrease of oxalate accumulation. In addition, <i>NtMATE</i> and <i>NtALS3</i> expression showed no difference between transgenic lines and wild-type plants. Taken together, our results suggest that VuAAE3-dependent turnover of oxalate plays a critical role in Al tolerance mechanisms.</p>

Identification of Homogentisate Dioxygenase as a Target for Vitamin E Biofortification in Oilseeds
<p>Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major plant source of protein and oil and produces important secondary metabolites beneficial for human health. As a tool for gene function discovery and improvement of this important crop, a mutant population was generated using fast neutron irradiation. Visual screening of mutagenized seeds identified a mutant line, designated MO12, which produced brown seeds as opposed to the yellow seeds produced by the unmodified Williams 82 parental cultivar. Using forward genetic methods combined with comparative genome hybridization analysis, we were able to establish that deletion of the <i>GmHGO1</i> gene is the genetic basis of the brown seeded phenotype exhibited by the MO12 mutant line. <i>GmHGO1</i> encodes a homogentisate dioxygenase (HGO), which catalyzes the committed enzymatic step in homogentisate catabolism. This report describes to our knowledge the first functional characterization of a plant <i>HGO</i> gene, defects of which are linked to the human genetic disease alkaptonuria. We show that reduced homogentisate catabolism in a soybean <i>HGO</i> mutant is an effective strategy for enhancing the production of lipid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e antioxidants such as vitamin E, as well as tolerance to herbicides that target pathways associated with homogentisate metabolism. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of fast neutron mutagenesis in identifying novel genes that contribute to soybean agronomic traits.</p>

Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two <i>Helicoverpa</i> species
<p>Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>H. assulta</i>. We expressed the protein in bacteria and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar solution, CSP4 is partly extruded from the proboscis. A solution of protein can also fill a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p>Females of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females.</p>

The chaperone domain BRICHOS prevents CNS toxicity of amyloid-β peptide in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>Aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) into toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils is linked to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mutations of the BRICHOS chaperone domain are associated with amyloid disease and recent <i>in vitro</i> data show that BRICHOS efficiently delays Aβ42 oligomerization and fibril formation. We have generated transgenic <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> flies that express the Aβ42 peptide and the BRICHOS domain in the central nervous system (CNS). Co-expression of Aβ42 and BRICHOS resulted in delayed Aβ42 aggregation and dramatic improvements of both lifespan and locomotor function compared with flies expressing Aβ42 alone. Moreover, BRICHOS increased the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e:in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solubl</span></strong>e Aβ42 and bound to deposits of Aβ42 in the fly brain. Our results show that the BRICHOS domain efficiently reduces the neurotoxic effects of Aβ42, although significant Aβ42 aggregation is taking place. We propose that BRICHOS-based approaches should be explored with an aim towards the future prevention and treatment of AD.</p>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity

Exposure of P1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>s to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16.

Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong> thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>eptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>s.

Structural insight into nucleosome transcription by RNA polymerase II with elongation factors
<p>RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes chromosomal DNA that contains multiple nucleosomes. The nucleosome forms transcriptional barriers, and nucleosomal transcription requires several additional factors in vivo. We demonstrate that the transcription elongation factors Elf1 and Spt4/5 cooperatively lower the barriers and increase the RNAPII processivity in the nucleosome. The cryo–el<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>tron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing RNAPII elongation complexes (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>s) reveal that Elf1 and Spt4/5 reshape the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong> downstream edge and intervene between RNAPII and the nucleosome. They facilitate RNAPII progression through superhelical location SHL(–1) by adjusting the nucleosome in favor of the forward progression. They suppress pausing at SHL(–5) by preventing the stable RNAPII-nucleosome interaction. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong> overcomes the nucleosomal barriers while providing a platform for various chromatin functions.</p>

Endothelial Dab1 signaling orchestrates neuro-glia-vessel communication in the central nervous system
<p>The archit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>ture of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is controlled by the communication of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. We found that the neuronal guidance cue reelin possesses proangiogenic activities that ensure the communication of endothelial cells (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>s) with the glia to control neuronal migration and the establishment of the blood-brain barrier in the mouse brain. Apolipoprotein E r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>eptor 2 (ApoER2) and Disabled1 (Dab1) expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>s are required for vascularization of the retina and the cerebral cortex. Deletion of Dab1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>s leads to a reduced s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>retion of laminin-α4 and d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>reased activation of integrin-β1 in glial cells, which in turn control neuronal migration and barrier properties of the NVU.

Targeting angiogenic metabolism in disease
<p>Blood vessels, which are lined by endothelial cells (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>s), supply oxygen and nutrients to every cell in the body.

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>otype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>otype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong> 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, esp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>ially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong> 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

PECTIN METHYLESTERASE34 Contributes to Heat Tolerance through Its Role in Promoting Stomatal Movement

Functional genome annotation predicts that at least 66 potential <i>PME</i> genes are contained in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thermotolerance assays of <i>PME</i> gene T-DNA insertion lines revealed two null mutant alleles of <i>PME34</i> (At3g49220) that both consistently showed reduced thermotolerance. Nevertheless, their impairment was independently associated with the expression of HS-responsive genes. It was also observed that <i>PME34</i> transcription was induced by abscisic acid and highly expressed in guard cells. We showed that the <i>PME34</i> mutation has a def<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>t in the control of stomatal movement and greatly altered PME and polygalacturonase (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong> 3.2.1.15) activity, resulting in a heat-sensitive phenotype. <i>PME34</i> has a role in the regulation of transpiration through the control of the stomatal aperture due to its cell wall-modifying enzyme activity during the HS response. Hence, PME34 is required for regulating guard cell wall flexibility to mediate the heat response in Arabidopsis.</p>

Laccase GhLac1 Modulates Broad-Spectrum Biotic Stress Tolerance via Manipulating Phenylpropanoid Pathway and Jasmonic Acid Synthesis
<p>Plants are constantly challenged by a multitude of pathogens and pests, which causes massive yield and quality losses annually. A promising approach to reduce such losses is to enhance the immune system of plants through genetic engineering. Previous work has shown that laccases (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong> 1.10.3.2) function as lignin polymerization enzymes. Here we demonstrate that transgenic manipulation of the expression of the laccase gene <i>GhLac1</i> in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) can confer an enhanced defense response to both pathogens and pests. Overexpression of <i>GhLac1</i> leads to increased lignification, associated with increased tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and to the ins<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>t pests cotton bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) and cotton aphid (<i>Aphis gosypii</i>). Suppression of <i>GhLac1</i> expression leads to a redir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>tion of metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway, causing the accumulation of JA and s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ec</span></strong>ondary metabolites that confer resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> and cotton bollworm; it also leads to increased susceptibility to cotton aphid.

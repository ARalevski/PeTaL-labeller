Global drainage patterns and the origins of topographic relief on Earth, Mars, and Titan
<p>Rivers have eroded the topography of Mars, Titan, and Earth, creating diverse landscapes. However, the dominant processes that generated topography on Titan (and to some extent on early Mars) are not well known. We analyzed drainage patterns on all three bodies and found that large drainages, which record interactions between deformation and erosional modification, conform much better to long-wavelength topography on Titan and Mars than on Earth. We use a numerical landscape evolution model to demonstrate that short-wavelength deformation causes drainage directions to diverge from long-wavelength topography, as observed on Earth. We attribute the observed differences to ancient long-wavelength topography on Mars, recent or ongoing generation of long-wavelength relief on Titan, and the creation of short-wavelength relief by plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

Inferring Earth’s discontinuous chemical layering from the 660-kilometer boundary topography
<p>Topography, or depth variation, of certain interfaces in the solid Earth can provide important insights into the dynamics of our planet interior. Although the intermediate- and long-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topographi</span></strong>c variation of the 660-kilometer boundary between Earth’s upper and lower mantle is well studied, small-scale measurements are far more challenging. We found a surprising amount of topography at short length scale along the 660-kilometer boundary in certain regions using scattered <i>P'P'</i> seismic waves. Our observations required chemical layering in regions with high short-scale roughness. By contrast, we did not see such small-scale topography along the 410-kilometer boundary in the upper mantle. Our ﬁndings support the concept of partially blocked or imperfect circulation between the upper and lower mantle.</p>

Earth and Moon impact flux increased at the end of the Paleozoic
<p>The terrestrial impact crater record is commonly assumed to be biased, with erosion thought to eliminate older craters, even on stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">terrain</span></strong>s. Given that the same projectile population strikes Earth and the Moon, terrestrial selection effects can be quantified by using a method to date lunar craters with diameters greater than 10 kilometers and younger than 1 billion years. We found that the impact rate increased by a factor of 2.6 about 290 million years ago. The terrestrial crater record shows similar results, suggesting that the deficit of large terrestrial craters between 300 million and 650 million years ago relative to more recent times stems from a lower impact flux, not preservation bias. The almost complete absence of terrestrial craters older than 650 million years may indicate a massive global-scale erosion event near that time.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multicellular bodies, starting from a single-cell zygote, often requires the movement of cells across considerable distances, which is achieved through cell migration. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, cells travel across diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">terrain</span></strong>s, which dictates the character of navigation (<i>1</i>). Cancer cells metastasize and migrate into healthy organs, and knowledge of their migration strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some migratory cells cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others migrate in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of collective cell migration has been considered a sum of migratory and signaling activities of individually participating cells. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), collective cell migration requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining cells at the rear of a cell group to coordinate, orient, and propel the entire group. This mechanism of collective cell migration could be applicable to cancer metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental migration.</p>

Ancient lowland Maya complexity as revealed by airborne laser scanning of northern Guatemala
<p>Lowland Maya civilization flourished in the tropical region of the Yucatan peninsula and environs for more than 2500 years (~1000 BCE to 1500 CE). Known for its sophistication in writing, art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics, Maya civilization still poses questions about the nature of its cities and surrounding populations because of its location in an inaccessible forest. In 2016, an aerial lidar survey across 2144 square kilometers of northern Guatemala mapped natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">terrain</span></strong> and archaeological features over several distinct areas. We present results from these data, revealing interconnected urban settlement and landscapes with extensive infrastructural development. Studied through a joint international effort of interdisciplinary teams sharing protocols, this lidar survey compels a reevaluation of Maya demography, agriculture, and political economy and suggests future avenues of field research.</p>

Modeling the ecology and evolution of biodiversity: Biogeographical cradles, museums, and graves
<p>Individual processes shaping geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical models and traditional experiments. To meet this challenge, we built a spatially explicit, mechanistic simulation model implementing adaptation, range shifts, fragmentation, speciation, dispersal, competition, and extinction, driven by modeled climates of the past 800,000 years in South America. Experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topographi</span></strong>c smoothing confirmed the impact of climate heterogeneity on diversification. The simulations identified regions and episodes of speciation (cradles), persistence (museums), and extinction (graves). Although the simulations had no target pattern and were not parameterized with empirical data, emerging richness maps closely resembled contemporary maps for major taxa, confirming powerful roles for evolution and diversification driven by topography and climate.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">landform</span></strong>s were created early in the comet’s current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation
<p>Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting conservation plans to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate forest canopy functional trait maps of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven mapped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern explained by geology, topography, hydrology, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of forest beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53% of each mapped, functionally distinct forest presents an opportunity for new conservation action. Mapping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change.</p>

High-resolution lithosphere viscosity and dynamics revealed by magnetotelluric imaging
<p>An accurate viscosity structure is critical to truthfully modeling lithosphere dynamics. Here, we report an attempt to infer the effective lithospheric viscosity from a high-resolution magnetotelluric (MT) survey across the western United States. The high sensitivity of MT fields to the presence of electrically conductive fluids makes it a promising proxy for determining mechanical strength variations throughout the lithosphere. We demonstrate how a viscosity structure, approximated from electrical resistivity, results in a geodynamic model that successfully predicts short-wavelength surface topography, lithospheric deformation, and mantle upwelling beneath recent volcanism. We further show that this viscosity is physically consistent with and better constrained than that derived from laboratory-based rheology. We conclude that MT imaging provides a practical observational constraint for quantifying the dynamic evolution of the continental lithosphere.</p>

Assessment of the equivalence of a generic to a branded femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the design of the generic   OptiStem XTR femoral stem with the established Exeter femoral stem.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We obtained five boxed, as manufactured, implants of both designs   at random (ten in total). Two examiners were blinded to the implant   design and independently measured the mass, volume, trunnion surface   topography, trunnion roughness, trunnion cone angle, Caput-Collum-Diaphyseal   (CCD) angle, femoral offset, stem length, neck length, and the width   and roughness of the polished stem shaft using peer-reviewed methods.   We then compared the stems using these parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that the OptiStems were lighter (p < 0.001), had   a rougher trunnion surface (p < 0.001) with a greater spacing   and depth of the machined threads (p < 0.001), had greater trunnion   cone angles (p = 0.007), and a smaller radius at the top of the   trunnion (p = 0.007). There was no difference in stem volume (p   = 0.643), CCD angle (p = 0.788), offset (p = 0.993), neck length   (p = 0.344), stem length (p = 0.808), shaft width (p = 0.058 to   0.720) or roughness of the polished surface (p = 0.536).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This preliminary investigation found that whilst there were similarities   between the two designs, the generic OptiStem is different to the   branded Exeter design.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:310–16.</p></sec>

Fractional Flow Reserve and Cardiac Events in Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We evaluated the prognosis of deferred and revascularized coronary stenoses after fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement to assess its revascularization threshold in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The IRIS-FFR registry (Interventional Cardiology Research In-cooperation Society Fractional Flow Reserve) prospectively enrolled 5846 patients with ≥1coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> with FFR measurement. Revascularization was deferred in 6468 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s and performed in 2165 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s after FFR assessment. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) at a median follow-up of 1.9 years and analyzed on a per-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> basis. A marginal Cox model accounted for correlated data in patients with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s, and a model to predict per-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> outcomes was adjusted for confounding factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>For deferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s, the risk of major adverse cardiac events demonstrated a significant, inverse relationship with FFR (adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.08; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not observed in revascularized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s (adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.70). For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s with FFR ≥0.76, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was not significantly different between deferred and revascularized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s. Conversely, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s with FFR ≤0.75, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was significantly lower in revascularized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s than in deferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s (for FFR 0.71–0.75, adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.021; for FFR ≤0.70, adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.84; <i>P</i>=0.012).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This large, prospective registry showed that the FFR value was linearly associated with the risk of cardiac events in deferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s. In addition, revascularization for coronary artery stenosis with a low FFR (≤0.75) was associated with better outcomes than the deferral, whereas for a stenosis with a high FFR (≥0.76), medical treatment would be a reasonable and safe treatment strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (SCD) use emergency medical services records, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> certificates, or definitions that infer cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s had no extracardiac cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction.

Long-Term Outcomes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed During Childhood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Late survival and symptomatic status of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been well defined. We examined long-term outcomes for pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Australian Childhood Cardiomyopathy Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children (0–10 years of age) diagnosed with cardiomyopathy between 1987 and 1996. The primary study end point was time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or cardiac transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>/transplantation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0–92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0–87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0–86.0) at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>/transplantation included symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.60–11.05; <i>P</i>=0.004), Noonan syndrome (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.02–8.08; <i>P</i>=0.045), higher posterior wall thickness <i>z</i> score (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22–1.73; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower fractional shortening <i>z</i> score (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.005) during follow-up.

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>) and noncardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. To explore competing risks, cause-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction.

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>.

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups. There were 961 HHF cases during 190 164 person-years follow-up (incidence rate, 0.51/100 person-years). Of 215 622 patients in the United States, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> occurred in 1334 (incidence rate, 0.87/100 person-years), and HHF or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in 1983 (incidence rate, 1.38/100 person-years).

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> were divided into sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and nonsudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years).

Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 Controls Necrotic Core Formation in Atherosclerotic Lesions by Impairing Efferocytosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid cells are central to atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> development and vulnerable plaque formation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed ability of arterial phagocytes to uptake apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> growth and establishment of a necrotic core.

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are still inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>ic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>ic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort).

Right Ventricular Systolic Function in Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>To assess the prevalence, determinants, and prognosis value of right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment in organic mitral regurgitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Two hundred eight patients (62±12 years, 138 males) with chronic organic mitral regurgitation referred to surgery underwent an echocardiography and biventricular radionuclide angiography with regional function assessment. Mean RV EF was 40.4±10.2%, ranging from 10% to 65%. RV EF was severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed (≤35%) in 63 patients (30%), and biventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment (left ventricular EF<60% and RV EF≤35%) was found in 34 patients (16%). Pathophysiologic correlates of RV EF were left ventricular septal function (β=0.42, <i>P</i><0.0001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter index (β=−0.22, <i>P</i>=0.002), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (β=−0.14, <i>P</i>=0.047). Mitral effective regurgitant orifice size (n=84) influenced RV EF (β=−0.28, <i>P</i>=0.012). In 68 patients examined after surgery, RV EF increased strongly (27.5±4.3–37.9±7.3, <i>P</i><0.0001) in patients with depressed RV EF, whereas it did not change in others (<i>P</i>=0.91).

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> is limited to the meristematic stem cell niche and its early descendants. The significance of this cell-type-specific programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> is unclear. Here, we demonstrate in roots that it is the programmed destruction of the mitotically compromised stem cell niche that triggers its regeneration, enabling growth recovery. In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth. We propose DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> is employed by plants as a developmental response, contrasting with its role as an anticarcinogenic response in animals. This role in plants may have evolved to restore the growth of embryos after the accumulation of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in seeds.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s and a resistance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s and plant resistance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> but not to induce plant resistance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of resistance against this class of pathogens.</p>

We also performed molecular and cellular biology studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which Traf2 regulates necroptosis signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a critical role for Traf2 in myocardial survival and homeostasis by suppressing necroptosis.

Plasma tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor α level was significantly elevated in <i>Traf2</i>-deficient mice, and genetic ablation of <i>TNFR1</i> largely abrogated pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction associated with Traf2 deletion.

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the integration of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease.

Inflammation, necrosis, and the kinase RIP3 are key mediators of AAG-dependent alkylation-induced retinal degeneration
<p>DNA-alkylating agents are commonly used to kill cancer cells, but the base excision repair (BER) pathway they trigger can also produce toxic intermediates that cause tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, such as retinal degeneration (RD). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, is assumed to be the main mechanism of this alkylation-induced photoreceptor (PR) cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in RD. Here, we studied the involvement of necroptosis (another programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> process) and inflammation in alkylation-induced RD. Male mice exposed to a methylating agent exhibited a reduced number of PR cell rows, active gliosis, and cytokine induction and macrophage infiltration in the retina. Dying PRs exhibited a necrotic morphology, increased 8-hydroxyguanosine abundance (an oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e marker), and overexpression of the necroptosis-associated genes <i>Rip1</i> and <i>Rip3</i>. The activity of PARP1, which mediates BER, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, and inflammation, was increased in PR cells and associated with the release of proinflammatory chemokine HMGB1 from PR nuclei. Mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exhibited more severe RD, whereas deficiency of RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) conferred partial protection. Female mice were partially protected from alkylation-induced RD, showing reduced necroptosis and inflammation compared to males. PRs in mice lacking the BER-initiating DNA glycosylase AAG did not exhibit alkylation-induced necroptosis or inflammation. Our findings show that AAG-initiated BER at alkylated DNA bases induces sex-dependent RD primarily by triggering necroptosis and activating an inflammatory response that amplifies the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and, furthermore, reveal new potential targets to prevent this side effect of chemotherapy.</p>

The aim of the study was to determine whether nonselective postmortem CIED interrogations and data analysis are useful to the forensic pathologist to determine the cause, mechanism, and time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From February 2012 to April 2017, all autopsy subjects in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital Charité who had a CIED underwent device removal and interrogation. Over the study period, 5368 autopsies were performed. One hundred fifty subjects had in total 151 CIEDs, including 109 pacemakers, 35 defibrillators, and 7 implantable loop recorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 40 cases (26.7%) time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and in 51 cases (34.0%) cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> could not be determined by forensic autopsy. Of these, CIED interrogation facilitated the determination of time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in 70.0% of the cases and clarified the cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in 60.8%. Device concerns were identified in 9 cases (6.0%), including 3 hardware, 4 programming, and 2 algorithm issues. One CIED was submitted to the manufacturer for a detailed technical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate the necessity of systematic postmortem CIED interrogation in forensic medicine to determine the cause and timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> more accurately. In addition, CIED analysis is an important tool to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec>

Transplant-Free Survival and Interventions at 6 Years in the SVR Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the SVR trial (Single Ventricle Reconstruction), 1-year transplant-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock–Taussig shunt in patients with hypoplastic left heart and related syndromes. At 6 years, we compared transplant-free survival and other outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medical history was collected annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Transplant-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt treatment effect had nonproportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s (<i>P</i>=0.009); the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio (HR) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or transplant favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92). The effect of shunt type on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or transplant was not statistically significant between stage II to Fontan surgery (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–2.17; <i>P</i>=0.17) or after the Fontan procedure (HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.74; <i>P</i>=0.52). By 6 years, patients with RVPAS had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (0.38 versus 0.23/patient-year, <i>P</i><0.001), primarily because of more interventions between the stage II and Fontan procedures (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–3.03). Complications did not differ by shunt type; by 6 years, 1 in 5 patients had had a thrombotic event, and 1 in 6 had had seizures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>By 6 years, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or transplant and catheter interventions were not different between the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups. Children assigned to the RVPAS group had 5% higher transplant-free survival, but the difference did not reach statistical significance, and they required more catheter interventions. Both treatment groups have accrued important complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

PCSK9 Variants, Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Neurocognitive Impairment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite concerns about adverse neurocognitive events raised by prior trials, pharmacological PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9) inhibition was not associated with neurocognitive effects in a recent phase 3 randomized trial. PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) variants that result in lifelong exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can provide information on the potential long-term effects of lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment and decline.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the association between PCSK9 LOF variants and neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment and decline among black REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) participants with (n=241) and without (n=10 454) C697X or Y142X LOF variants. Neurocognitive tests included the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) battery (Word List Learning, World List Delayed Recall, Semantic Animal Fluency) and Six-Item Screener (SIS) assessments, administered longitudinally during follow-up. Neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment was defined as a score ≥1.5 SD below age, sex, and education-based stratum-specific means on 2 or 3 CERAD assessments or, separately, a score <5 on any SIS assessment at baseline or during follow-up. Neurocognitive decline was assessed using standardized continuous scores on individual neurocognitive tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean sample age was 64 years (SD, 9), 62% were women, and the prevalence of neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment at any assessment was 6.3% by CERAD and 15.4% by SIS definitions. Adjusted odds ratios for neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment for participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58–2.13) using the CERAD battery and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.61–1.30) using the SIS assessment. Standardized average differences in individual neurocognitive assessment scores over the 5.6-year (range, 0.1–9.1) study period ranged between 0.07 (95% CI, −0.06 to 0.20) and −0.07 (95% CI, −0.18 to 0.05) among participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants. Patterns of neurocognitive decline were similar between participants with and without PCSK9 LOF variants (all <i>P</i>>0.10). Odds ratios for neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment per 20 mg/dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decrements were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96–1.08) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95–1.02) for the CERAD and SIS definitions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results suggest that lifelong exposure to low PCSK9 levels and cumulative exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are not associated with neurocognitive effects in blacks.</p></sec>

P2X<sub>7</sub> Deficiency Blocks Lesional Inflammasome Activity and Ameliorates Atherosclerosis in Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds as a danger signal to purinergic receptor P2X<sub>7</sub> and promotes inflammasome assembly and interleukin-1β expression. We hypothesized a functional role of the signal axis ATP–P2X<sub>7</sub> in inflammasome activation and the chronic inflammation driving atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent and P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient macrophages were isolated and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, ATP, or both. To assess whether P2X<sub>7</sub> may have a role in atherosclerosis, P2X<sub>7</sub> expression was analyzed in aortic arches from low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>-/-</sup> mice consuming a high-cholesterol or chow diet. P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>+/+</sup> and P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>−/−</sup> mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet to investigate the functional role of P2X<sub>7</sub> knockout in atherosclerosis. Human plaques were derived from carotid endarterectomy and stained against P2X<sub>7</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide or ATP stimulation alone did not activate caspase 1 in isolated macrophages. However, priming with lipopolysaccharide, followed by stimulation with ATP, led to an activation of caspase 1 and interleukin-1β in P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent macrophages. In contrast, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient macrophages showed no activation of caspase 1 after sequential stimulation while still expressing a basal amount of interleukin-1β. P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor was higher expressed in murine atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s, particularly by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>al macrophages. After 16 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice showed smaller atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s than P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent mice (0.162 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.023 [n=9], P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>−/−</sup> : 0.084 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.01 [n=11], <i>P</i>=0.004) with a reduced amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>al macrophages. In accord with our in vitro findings, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>al caspase 1 activity was abolished in P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> mice. In addition, intravital microscopy revealed reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion in P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice.

Modeling chemotherapy-induced stress to identify rational combination therapies in the DNA damage response pathway
<p>Cells respond to DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e by activating complex signaling networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair and survival but also cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. We have developed a multiscale computational model that quantitatively links chemotherapy-induced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response signaling to cell fate. The computational model was trained and calibrated on extensive data from U2OS osteosarcoma cells, including the cell cycle distribution of the initial cell population, signaling data measured by Western blotting, and cell fate data in response to chemotherapy treatment measured by time-lapse microscopy. The resulting mechanistic model predicted the cellular responses to chemotherapy alone and in combination with targeted inhibitors of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response pathway, which we confirmed experimentally. Computational models such as the one presented here can be used to understand the molecular basis that defines the complex interplay between cell survival and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and to rationally identify chemotherapy-potentiating drug combinations.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, replicative stress activates the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment. These findings suggest that the SVI could be a more appropriate treatment target than cardiac index in PAH.</p></sec>

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. Children with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations.

Excess Cardiovascular Risk in Women Relative to Men Referred for Coronary Angiography Is Associated With Severely Impaired Coronary Flow Reserve, Not Obstructive Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) fatality rates are higher for women than for men, yet obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is less prevalent in women. Coronary flow reserve (CFR), an integrated measure of large- and small-vessel CAD and myocardial ischemia, identifies patients at risk for CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, but is not routinely measured in clinical practice. We sought to investigate the impact of sex, CFR, and angiographic CAD severity on adverse cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Consecutive patients (n=329, 43% women) referred for invasive coronary angiography after stress testing with myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography and with left ventricular ejection fraction >40% were followed (median, 3.0 years) for a composite end point of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction or heart failure. The extent and severity of angiographic CAD were estimated by using the CAD prognostic index, and CFR was quantified by using positron emission tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Although women in comparison with men had lower pretest clinical scores, rates of prior myocardial infarction, and burden of angiographic CAD (<i>P</i><0.001), they demonstrated greater risk of CVD events, even after adjustment for traditional risk factors, imaging findings, and early revascularization (adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–4.02; <i>P</i>=0.03). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed CFR was similarly present among women and men, but in patients with low CFR (<1.6, n=163), women showed a higher frequency of nonobstructive CAD, whereas men showed a higher frequency of severely obstructive CAD (<i>P</i>=0.002). After also adjusting for CFR, the effect of sex on outcomes was no longer significant. When stratified by sex and CFR, only women with severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed CFR demonstrated significantly increased adjusted risk of CVD events (<i>P</i><0.0001, <i>P</i> for interaction=0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Women referred for coronary angiography had a significantly lower burden of obstructive CAD in comparison with men but were not protected from CVD events. Excess cardiovascular risk in women was independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed CFR, representing a hidden biological risk, and a phenotype less amenable to revascularization. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed CFR, particularly absent severely obstructive CAD, may represent a novel target for CVD risk reduction.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Paclitaxel–Coated Versus Uncoated Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Angioplasty for Femoropopliteal Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Numerous studies have reported favorable outcomes using drug-coated balloons (DCBs) for treatment of symptomatic peripheral artery disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. However, the treatment effect compared with an uncoated balloon has differed greatly among the randomized trials, with better outcomes observed with higher-dose DCBs. This European trial was designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a next-generation low-dose (2-µg/mm<sup>2</sup> surface dose of paclitaxel) DCB.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded trial. Patients were randomized (3:1) to treatment with a low-dose DCB or an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon. The primary safety end point was a composite of freedom from device- and procedure-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> through 30 days after the procedure and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> revascularization through 12 months after the procedure.

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s per year. A consequence of this treatment strategy, however, could be an increase in serious adverse events.</p></sec>

Transplantation-Free Survival and Interventions at 3 Years in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>In the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial, 1-year transplantation-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS). At 3 years, we compared transplantation-free survival, echocardiographic right ventricular ejection fraction, and unplanned interventions in the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Vital status and medical history were ascertained from annual medical records, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> indexes, and phone interviews. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial. Transplantation-free survival for the RVPAS versus MBTS groups did not differ at 3 years (67% versus 61%; <i>P</i>=0.15) or with all available follow-up of 4.8±1.1 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.14). Pre-Fontan right ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the RVPAS group than in the MBTS group (41.7<i>±</i>5.1% versus 44.7<i>±</i>6.0%; <i>P</i>=0.007), and right ventricular ejection fraction deteriorated in RVPAS (<i>P</i>=0.004) but not MBTS (<i>P</i>=0.40) subjects (pre-Fontan minus 14-month mean, −3.25±8.24% versus 0.99±8.80%; <i>P</i>=0.009). The RVPAS versus MBTS treatment effect had nonproportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s (<i>P</i>=0.004); the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio favored the RVPAS before 5 months (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio=0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.88) but the MBTS beyond 1 year (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio=2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–4.62).

Association Between Physician Follow-Up and Outcomes of Care After Chest Pain Assessment in High-Risk Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Assessment of chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits in developed countries. Although guidelines recommend primary care physician (PCP) follow-up for patients who are subsequently discharged, little is known about the relationship between physician follow-up and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>An observational study was conducted on patients with higher baseline risk, defined as having diabetes mellitus or established cardiovascular disease, who were evaluated for chest pain, discharged, and without adverse clinical outcomes for 30 days in Ontario from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> models were constructed to adjust for potential confounding between physician groups (cardiologist, PCP, or none). Among 56767 included patients, 17% were evaluated by cardiologists, 58% were evaluated by PCPs alone, and 25% had no physician follow-up. The mean age was 66±15 years, and 53% were male. The highest rates of diagnostic testing, medical therapy, and coronary revascularization were seen among patients treated by cardiologists. At 1 year, the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or MI was 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 5.0–5.9) in the cardiology group, 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.4–7.9) in the PCP group, and 8.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.2–9.1) in the no-physician group.

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that amplifiable DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using templates with known amplifiable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s were amplified very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s, and C->T transitions in amplified uracil containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random amplification preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>e (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the risks of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased risk of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar risk of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing risk analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke risk (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing risk model), with no difference in ICH risk compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing risk model), with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH. Thus, OACs may still be considered as thromboprophylaxis for elderly patients, with NOACs being the more favorable choice.</p></sec>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71).

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Efficacy and Safety of the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Concomitant Aspirin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines recommend non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as the first-choice therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation because these drugs have several benefits over the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). It is unknown whether these benefits remain when NOACs have to be combined with aspirin therapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs compared with VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy, we conducted a systematic review and study–based meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic electronic literature search was done in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials for studies including published data of patients ≥18 years of age with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, randomized to either VKAs or NOACs, or receiving aspirin therapy at any time during the study that report all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, or intracranial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>e as an outcome. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome were extracted from the individual studies and pooled with random-effects meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>This study-based meta-analysis was restricted to the subgroups of patients on aspirin therapy (n=21 722) from 4 randomized controlled trials comparing VKAs and NOACs (n=71 681) in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In this meta-analysis including patients on mainly low-dose aspirin, NOACs were found to be more effective (outcome of stroke or systemic embolism: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91; vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>: HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93) and as safe as VKAs with respect to major bleeding (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.01). NOACs were safer with respect to the reduction of intracranial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>e (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26–0.56).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study-based meta-analysis shows that it may be both safer and more effective to use NOACs compared with VKAs to treat patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy.</p></sec>

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for operators. This study aimed to measure DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e/repair markers in operators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e was determined by irradiating operators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in operators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in operators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when operators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response in operators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding. Defining the relationship between this response and cancer risk may better inform safe levels of chronic low-dose radiation exposure.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Randomized Comparison of Ridaforolimus- and Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stents in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The safety and efficacy of a novel cobalt alloy-based coronary stent with a durable elastomeric polymer eluting the antiproliferative agent ridaforolimus for treatment of patients with coronary artery disease is undetermined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A prospective, international 1:1 randomized trial was conducted to evaluate in a noninferiority design the relative safety and efficacy of ridaforolimus-eluting stents (RESs) and slow-release zotarolimus-eluting stents among 1919 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at 76 centers. Inclusion criteria allowed enrollment of patients with recent myocardial infarction, total occlusions, bifurcations <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s, and other complex conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar between the groups.

Stellarex Drug-Coated Balloon for Treatment of Femoropopliteal Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are a predominant revascularization therapy for symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. Because of the differences in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and coating morphologies, varying clinical outcomes have been observed with different DCBs. We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong>s With A Novel Paclitaxel-Coated Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100).

In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-Coated Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified. The primary safety end point was met (92.1% for DCB versus 83.2% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.025 for superiority) and the primary patency rate was significantly higher with DCB (76.3% for DCB versus 57.6% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.003).

Risk for Major Bleeding in Patients Receiving Ticagrelor Compared With Aspirin After Transient Ischemic Attack or Acute Ischemic Stroke in the SOCRATES Study (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at high risk for subsequent stroke, and more potent antiplatelet therapy in the acute setting is needed. However, the potential benefit of more intense antiplatelet therapy must be assessed in relation to the risk for major bleeding. The SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes) was the first trial with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in which the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were compared with those of aspirin. The main safety objective was assessment of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)–defined major bleeds on treatment, with special focus on intracranial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>e (ICrH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An independent adjudication committee blinded to study treatment classified bleeds according to the PLATO, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) definitions. The definitions of ICrH and major bleeding excluded cerebral microbleeds and asymptomatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>ic transformations of cerebral infarctions so that the definitions better discriminated important events in the acute stroke population.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 13 130 of 13 199 randomized patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. PLATO major bleeds occurred in 31 patients (0.5%) on ticagrelor and 38 patients (0.6%) on aspirin (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–1.34). The most common locations of major bleeds were intracranial and gastrointestinal. ICrH was reported in 12 patients (0.2%) on ticagrelor and 18 patients (0.3%) on aspirin. Thirteen of all 30 ICrHs (4 on ticagrelor and 9 on aspirin) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>ic strokes, and 4 (2 in each group) were symptomatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemorrhag</span></strong>ic transformations of brain infarctions. The ICrHs were spontaneous in 6 and 13, traumatic in 3 and 3, and procedural in 3 and 2 patients on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively. In total, 9 fatal bleeds occurred on ticagrelor and 4 on aspirin. The composite of ICrH or fatal bleeding included 15 patients on ticagrelor and 18 on aspirin. Independently of bleeding classification, PLATO, TIMI, or GUSTO, the relative difference between treatments for major/severe bleeds was similar. Nonmajor bleeds were more common on ticagrelor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack showed a bleeding profile similar to that of aspirin for major bleeds.

Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Included were large (n≥1000), randomized, controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy and PCI alone in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. Individual patient data were provided by the leadership of each trial. The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06). Stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred in 66 (0.8%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 46 (0.5%) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–2.10; <i>P</i>=0.06). There were no significant differences in recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure, or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with high thrombus burden (TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] thrombus grade ≥3), thrombus aspiration was associated with fewer cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s (170 [2.5%] versus 205 [3.1%]; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.03) and with more strokes or transient ischemic attacks (55 [0.9%] versus 34 [0.5%]; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.42, <i>P</i>=0.04). However, the interaction <i>P</i> values were 0.32 and 0.34, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Routine thrombus aspiration during PCI for ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction did not improve clinical outcomes.

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lesion</span></strong> revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. We calculated the risk estimates for main outcomes according to a fixed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher risk of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher risk at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased risk of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the risk of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year. Risk of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> was similar between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our meta-analysis of randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years demonstrated a higher risk of ST and of TLF in patients treated with BVS compared with EES.

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each test result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other test results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 tests were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal tests, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD risk was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6). Findings replicated in the Dallas Health Study were similar for the ASCVD outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among adults without known CVD, a novel multimodality testing strategy using left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly improved global CVD and ASCVD risk assessment.</p></sec>

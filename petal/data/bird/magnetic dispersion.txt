Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic properties of vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization, localized defects, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong> chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism of 2D vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s.</p>

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometer made in situ measurements of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and show displacement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s, but device-oriented characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the layered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We electrically detect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic ground state and interlayer coupling and observe a field-induced meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition. The meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic excitations (magnons) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic multilayer devices that exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance are the backbone of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> layers across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer. The layer-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic switching leads to sharp steplike hysteresis loops with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization plateaus depending on the repetition number of the stacking bilayers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature. The findings will add functionalities to devices with correlated-oxide interfaces.</p>

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet
<p>Spin waves are collective excitations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic systems. An attractive setting for studying long-lived spin-wave physics is the quantum Hall (QH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>, which forms spontaneously in clean two-dimensional electron systems at low temperature and in a perpendicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We used out-of-equilibrium occupation of QH edge channels in graphene to excite and detect spin waves in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically ordered QH states. Our experiments provide direct evidence for long-distance spin-wave propagation through different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic phases in the <i>N</i> = 0 Landau level, as well as across the insulating canted anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic phase. Our results will enable experimental investigation of the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic properties of these exotic two-dimensional electron systems.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ions and gels of para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonpara<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism.</p>

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters. The control of configuration and motion of the domain walls (DWs) enables nonvolatile responses against minute external fields. Here, we realize chiral edge states (CESs) on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic DWs of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic topological insulator. We design and fabricate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains in the quantum anomalous Hall state with the tip of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic force microscope and prove the existence of the chiral one-dimensional edge conduction along the prescribed DWs through transport measurements. The proof-of-concept devices based on reconfigurable CESs and Landauer-Buttiker formalism are realized for multiple-domain configurations with well-defined DW channels. Our results may lead to the realization of low-power-consumption spintronic devices.</p>

Structure, force balance, and topology of Earth’s magnetopause
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>opause deflects the solar wind plasma and confines Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>osphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>opause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, reveals a complex topology with the creation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic ropes at the boundary.</p>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic single atoms and molecules are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use molecule-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic molecule, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interactions with another molecule adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interaction strength, revealing angstrom-scale regions where the quantum states of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic molecules strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic single-molecule sensors.</p>

Chirally coupled nanomagnets
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically coupled nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s have multiple applications in nonvolatile memories, logic gates, and sensors. The most effective couplings have been found to occur between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layers in a vertical stack. We achieved strong coupling of laterally adjacent nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s using the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This coupling is mediated by chiral domain walls between out-of-plane and in-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic regions and dominates the behavior of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s below a critical size.

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field
<p>A study published this week offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can sense Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sense, do we ever use it? And does it arise from an iron mineral found in our brains, as the authors believe? The experiment recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in brain waves of a certain frequency. But some researchers aren't convinced that the brain's reaction to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field represents a true "sense" unless this reaction also guides our behavior.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin polarization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization. The interaction is not controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field per se, but rather by the electron spin orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

The magnetic field and turbulence of the cosmic web measured using a brilliant fast radio burst
<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events thought to originate beyond the Milky Way galaxy.

On the basis of a low Faraday rotation (12.0 ± 0.7 radians per square meter), we infer negligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization of the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nanogauss, parallel to the line-of-sight.

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with incident heart failure (HF) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance.

Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction.

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The tunneling of spin-polarized electrons across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron spin transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling by placing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic probe tip in close proximity to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the tunneling barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the spin texture of the sample lead to spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a spin detector for spintronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling to convert spin information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy molecules are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) molecules in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. The atom-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 resonances in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed atom-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields to suppress superconductivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood.

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator
<p>Understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phases in quantum mechanical systems is one of the essential goals in condensed matter physics, and the advent of prototype quantum simulation hardware has provided new tools for experimentally probing such systems.

The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes.

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism

This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields, which is manifested by quantum oscillations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations. These unconventional oscillations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum oscillations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

Numerical evidence of fluctuating stripes in the normal state of high-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> cuprate superconductors

We used numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations to demonstrate dynamical stripe correlations in the three-band Hubbard model, which represents the local electronic structure of the copper-oxygen plane.

The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin diffusion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular diffusion. To mitigate the influence of diffusion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>
<p>The Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) is an exotic emergent state of matter exhibiting Majorana fermion and gauge flux excitations. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> is thought to realize a proximate KQSL. We used neutron scattering on single crystals of α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> to reconstruct dynamical correlations in energy-momentum space. We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of scattering over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with scattering from the Majorana excitations of a KQSL. Other, more delicate experimental features can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. Our results encourage further study of this prototypical material and may open a window into investigating emergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic Majorana fermions in correlated materials.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase. Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.</p>

Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution
<p>Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10<sup>4</sup> for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high electron mobility and an unusual electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, known as the transverse electron focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, electron-electron collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Preassembled GPCR signaling complexes mediate distinct cellular responses to ultralow ligand concentrations
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface signaling proteins, participate in nearly all physiological processes, and are the targets of 30% of marketed drugs. Typically, nanomolar to micromolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand are used to activate GPCRs in experimental systems. We detected GPCR responses to a wide range of ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, from attomolar to millimolar, by measuring GPCR-stimulated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mathematical modeling showed that femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand activated, on average, 40% of the cells in a population provided that a cell was activated by one to two binding events. Furthermore, activation of the endogenous β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (M<sub>3</sub>R) by femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand in cell lines and human cardiac fibroblasts caused sustained increases in nuclear translocation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively. These responses were spatially and temporally distinct from those that occurred in response to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand and resulted in a distinct cellular proteomic profile. This highly sensitive signaling depended on the GPCRs forming preassembled, higher-order signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. Recognizing that GPCRs respond to ultralow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of neurotransmitters and hormones challenges established paradigms of drug action and provides a previously unappreciated aspect of GPCR activation that is quite distinct from that typically observed with higher ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations.</p>

Increase in predator-prey size ratios throughout the Phanerozoic history of marine ecosystems
<p>The escalation hypothesis posits that predation by increasingly powerful and metabolically active carnivores has been a major driver of metazoan evolution. We test a key tenet of this hypothesis by analyzing predatory drill holes in fossil marine shells, which provide a ~500-million-year record of individual predator-prey interactions. We show that drill-hole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> is a robust predictor of body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> among modern drilling predators and that drill-hole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> (and thus inferred predator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and power) rose substantially from the Ordovician to the Quaternary period, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of drilled prey remained stable. Together, these trends indicate a directional increase in predator-prey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> ratios. We hypothe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> that increasing predator-prey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> ratios reflect increases in prey abundance, prey nutrient content, and predation among predators.</p>

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil migration.</p>

Screening of Odor-Receptor Pairs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Reveals Different Receptors for High and Low Odor Concentrations

Recurrent cortical circuits implement concentration-invariant odor coding
<p>Animals rely on olfaction to find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. To support these behaviors, they must be able to identify odors across different odorant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The neural circuit operations that implement this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation invariance remain unclear. We found that despite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependence in the olfactory bulb (OB), representations of odor identity were preserved downstream, in the piriform cortex (PCx). The OB cells responding earliest after inhalation drove robust responses in sparse subsets of PCx neurons. Recurrent collateral connections broadcast their activation across the PCx, recruiting global feedback inhibition that rapidly truncated and suppressed cortical activity for the remainder of the sniff, discounting the impact of slower, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependent OB inputs. Eliminating recurrent collateral output amplified PCx odor responses rendered the cortex steeply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependent and abolished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-invariant identity decoding.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Forever Young: The Role of Ubiquitin Receptor DA1 and E3 Ligase BIG BROTHER in Controlling Leaf Growth and Development
<p>The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of plant organs is determined by a combination of cell proliferation and cell expansion. Leaves account for a large part of above-ground biomass and provide energy to complete the plant’s life cycle. Although the final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of leaves is remarkably constant under fixed environmental conditions, several genes have been described to enhance leaf growth when their expression is modulated. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> increase leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>, an effect that is synergistically enhanced in the double mutant. Here, we show that overexpression of a dominant-negative version of <i>DA1</i> enhances leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> in a broad range of natural accessions of this species, indicating a highly conserved role of this protein in controlling organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. We also found that during early stages of development, leaves of <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> mutants were already larger than the isogenic Col-0 wild type, but this phenotype was triggered by different cellular mechanisms. Later during development, <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> leaves showed a prolonged longevity, which was enhanced in the double mutant. Conversely, ectopic expression of <i>DA1</i> or <i>BB</i> restricted growth and promoted leaf senescence. In concert, shortly upon induction of <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> expression, several marker genes for the transition from proliferation to expansion were highly up-regulated. Additionally, multiple genes involved in maintaining the mitotic cell cycle were rapidly down-regulated and senescence genes were strongly up-regulated, particularly upon <i>BB</i> induction. With these results, we demonstrate that DA1 and BB restrict leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and promote senescence through converging and different mechanisms.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>
<p>The second messenger cyclic di–adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential in the Gram-positive model organism <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and in related pathogenic bacteria. It controls the activity of the conserved <i>ydaO</i> riboswitch and of several proteins involved in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) uptake. We found that the YdaO protein was conserved among several different bacteria and provide evidence that YdaO functions as a K<sup>+</sup> transporter. Thus, we renamed the gene and protein KimA (K<sup>+</sup> importer A). Reporter activity assays indicated that expression beyond the c-di-AMP–responsive riboswitch of the <i>kimA</i> upstream regulatory region occurred only in bacteria grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that c-di-AMP accumulated in bacteria grown in the presence of high K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations but not in low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. A bacterial strain lacking all genes encoding c-di-AMP–synthesizing enzymes was viable when grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, but not at higher K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations unless it acquired suppressor mutations in the gene encoding the cation exporter NhaK. Thus, our results indicated that the control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of c-di-AMP.</p>

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in cells.</p>

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes.</p>

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and distribution to different organs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in rice. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in older leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the rice heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the transformed yeast cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the redistribution of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in rice.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>d via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. Additional experiments with altered oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and empha<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Tracing the origin and evolution of pseudokinases across the tree of life
<p>Protein phosphorylation by eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) is a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in all organisms. In model vertebrates, ~10% of ePKs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed as pseudokinases, which have amino acid changes within the catalytic machinery of the kinase domain that distinguish them from their canonical kinase counterparts. However, pseudokinases still regulate various signaling pathways, usually doing so in the absence of their own catalytic output. To investigate the prevalence, evolutionary relationships, and biological diversity of these pseudoenzymes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative pseudokinase sequences in available eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal proteomes. We found that pseudokinases are present across all domains of life, and we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed nearly 30,000 eukaryotic, 1500 bacterial, and 20 archaeal pseudokinase sequences into 86 pseudokinase families, including ~30 families that were previously unknown. We uncovered a rich variety of pseudokinases with notable expansions not only in animals but also in plants, fungi, and bacteria, where pseudokinases have previously received cursory attention. These expansions are accompanied by domain shuffling, which suggests roles for pseudokinases in plant innate immunity, plant-fungal interactions, and bacterial signaling. Mechanistically, the ancestral kinase fold has diverged in many distinct ways through the enrichment of unique sequence motifs to generate new families of pseudokinases in which the kinase domain is repurposed for noncanonical nucleotide binding or to stabilize unique, inactive kinase conformations. We further provide a collection of annotated pseudokinase sequences in the Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) as a new mineable resource for the signaling community.</p>

Stepwise phosphorylation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> receptor 1 defines cellular responses to leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>
<p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) receptor type 1 (BLT1) is abundant in phagocytic and immune cells and plays crucial roles in various inflammatory diseases. BLT1 is phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues upon stimulation with the inflammatory lipid LTB<sub>4</sub>. Using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate differentially phosphorylated forms of BLT1, we identified two distinct types of phosphorylation, basal and ligand-induced, in the carboxyl terminus of human BLT1. In the absence of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the basal phosphorylation sites were modified to various degrees, giving rise to many different phosphorylated forms of BLT1. Different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of LTB<sub>4</sub> induced distinct phosphorylation events, and these ligand-induced modifications facilitated additional phosphorylation events at the basal phosphorylation sites. Because neutrophils migrate toward inflammatory sites along a gradient of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the degree of BLT1 phosphorylation likely increases in parallel with the increase in LTB<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation as the cells migrate. At high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of LTB<sub>4</sub>, deficiencies in these two types of phosphorylation events impaired chemotaxis and β-hexosaminidase release, a proxy for degranulation, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, respectively. These results suggest that an LTB<sub>4</sub> gradient around inflammatory sites enhances BLT1 phosphorylation in a stepwise manner to facilitate the precise migration of phagocytic and immune cells and the initiation of local responses, including degranulation.</p>

Homogenized halides and alkali cation segregation in alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites

Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

Fish reproductive-energy output increases disproportionately with body size
<p>Body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> determines total reproductive-energy output. Most theories assume reproductive output is a fixed proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>, with respect to mass, but formal macroecological tests are lacking. Management based on that assumption risks underestimating the contribution of larger mothers to replenishment, hindering sustainable harvesting. We test this assumption in marine fishes with a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of the intraspecific mass scaling of reproductive-energy output. We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how reproduction scales with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting cause fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s to decline; our results provide quantitative estimates of how these declines affect fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nanograined materials is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated temperatures. As grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> decreases into the nanoscale, grain coarsening occurs at much lower temperatures, as low as ambient temperatures for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>d grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low temperatures exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. The instability temperature rises substantially at smaller grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s, and the nanograins remain stable even above the recrystallization temperatures of coarse grains. The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene

This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility.

Global climatic drivers of leaf size
<p>Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> varies by over a 100,000-fold among species worldwide. Although 19th-century plant geographers noted that the wet tropics harbor plants with exceptionally large leaves, the latitudinal gradient of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> has not been well quantified nor the key climatic drivers convincingly identified. Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. Large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; small-leaved species typify hot, sunny environments only in arid conditions; small leaves are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences are key to geographic gradients in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. This knowledge can enrich “next-generation” vegetation models in which leaf temperature and water use during photosynthesis play key roles.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

How boundaries shape chemical delivery in microfluidics
<p>Many microfluidic systems—including chemical reaction, sample analysis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, chemotaxis, and drug development and injection—require control and precision of solute transport. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation levels are easily specified at injection, pressure-driven transport through channels is known to spread the initial distribution, resulting in reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations downstream. Here we document an unexpected phenomenon: The channel’s cross-sectional aspect ratio alone can control the shape of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation profile along the channel length. Thin channels (aspect ratio << 1) deliver solutes arriving with sharp fronts and tapering tails, whereas thick channels (aspect ratio ~ 1) produce the opposite effect. This occurs for rectangular and elliptical pipes, independent of initial distributions. Thus, it is possible to deliver solute with prescribed distributions, ranging from gradual buildup to sudden delivery, based only on the channel dimensions.</p>

Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice
<p>Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are reversible processes that play crucial roles in regulating organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> in plants. However, information linking deubiquitination and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is limited. Here, we characterized a dominant large-grain mutant, <i>large grain1-D</i> (<i>lg1-D</i>), with a 30.8% increase in seed width and a 34.5% increase in 1,000-grain weight relative to the wild type. The <i>lg1-D</i> mutant had more cells oriented in the lateral direction of the spikelet hull compared with the wild type. Map-based cloning showed that <i>LG1</i> encodes a constitutively expressed ubiquitin-specific protease15 (OsUBP15) that possesses deubiquitination activity in vitro. Loss-of-function and down-regulated expression of <i>OsUBP15</i> produced narrower and smaller grains than the control. A set of in vivo experiments indicated that the mutant Osubp15 had enhanced protein stability relative to wild-type OsUBP15. Further experiments verified that OsDA1 directly interacted with OsUBP15. Genetic data indicated that <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i>GRAIN WIDTH 2</i> (<i>GW2</i>) were not independent in regulating grain width and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. In summary, we identified OsUBP15 as a positive regulator of grain width and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> in rice and provide a promising strategy for improvement of grain yield by pyramiding <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i>gw2</i>.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>d tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Making Epidermal Bladder Cells Bigger: Developmental- and Salinity-Induced Endopolyploidy in a Model Halophyte
<p>Endopolyploidy occurs when DNA replication takes place without subsequent mitotic nuclear division, resulting in cell-specific ploidy levels within tissues. In plants, endopolyploidy plays an important role in sustaining growth and development, but only a few studies have demonstrated a role in abiotic stress response. In this study, we investigated the function of ploidy level and nuclear and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> in leaf expansion throughout development and tracked cell type-specific ploidy in the halophyte <i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i>. In addition to developmental endopolyploidy, we examined the effects of salinity stress on ploidy level. We focused specifically on epidermal bladder cells (EBC), which are modified balloon-like trichomes, due to their large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and role in salt accumulation. Our results demonstrate that ploidy increases as the leaves expand in a similar manner for each leaf type, and ploidy levels up to 512C were recorded for nuclei in EBC of leaves of adult plants. Salt treatment led to a significant increase in ploidy levels in the EBC, and these cells showed spatially related differences in their ploidy and nuclear and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> depending on the positions on the leaf and stem surface. Transcriptome analysis highlighted salinity-induced changes in genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, endoreduplication, and trichome development in EBC. The increase in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and ploidy observed in <i>M. crystallinum</i> under salinity stress may contribute to salt tolerance by increasing the storage capacity for sodium sequestration brought about by higher metabolic activity driving rapid cell enlargement in the leaf tissue and EBC.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several transporters involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

Pipeline to Identify Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins
<p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are functional proteins that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial biological functions of more of these proteins are uncovered. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell wall proteins, the hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their protein backbones are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they contain repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many biological functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the protein-rich walls of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich walls of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan proteins, extensins, and proline-rich proteins, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of MAAB was achieved using available genomic resources and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>) data set. Significant improvement in the detection of HRGPs using multiple-<i>k-</i>mer transcriptome assembly methodology was observed. The MAAB pipeline is readily adaptable and can be modified to optimize the recovery of IDPs from other organisms.</p>

Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice atypical HLH protein <i>Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1</i>-<i>LIKE1</i> (<i>OsBUL1</i>) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. <i>OsBUL1</i> knockout mutant (<i>osbul1</i>) and transgenic rice for double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of <i>OsBUL1</i> produced erect leaves with smaller grains, whereas <i>OsBUL1</i> overexpressors and an activation tagging line of <i>OsBUL1</i> exhibited increased lamina inclination and grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. Moreover, <i>OsBUL1</i> expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and <i>osbul1</i> did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice. Expression of <i>OsBC1</i> is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of <i>OsBUL1</i>. Transgenic rice plants expressing <i>OsBC1</i> under the control of <i>OsBUL1</i> promoter showed increased grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of <i>OsBC1</i> displayed reduced plant height and grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>.</p>

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a dynamic (rocking) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to dynamic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong> and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

cGMP-Elevating Compounds and Ischemic Conditioning Provide Cardioprotection Against Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury via Cardiomyocyte-Specific BK Channels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I signaling pathway can afford protection against the ischemia/reperfusion injury that occurs during myocardial infarction. Reportedly, voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels of the BK type are stimulated by cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I, and recent ex vivo studies implicated that increased BK activity favors the survival of the myocardium at ischemia/reperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether the molecular events downstream of cGMP involve BK channels present in cardiomyocytes or in other cardiac cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene-targeted mice with a cardiomyocyte- or smooth muscle cell–specific deletion of the BK (CMBK or SMBK knockouts) were subjected to the open-chest model of myocardial infarction. Infarct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s of the conditional mutants were compared with litter-matched controls, global BK knockout, and wild-type mice. Cardiac damage was assessed after mechanical conditioning or pharmacological stimulation of the cGMP pathway and by using direct modulators of BK. Long-term outcome was studied with respect to heart functions and cardiac fibrosis in a chronic myocardial infarction model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Global BK knockouts and CMBK knockouts, in contrast with SMBK knockouts, exhibited significantly larger infarct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">size</span></strong>s compared with their respective controls. Ablation of CMBK resulted in higher serum levels of cardiac troponin I and elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species, lower phosphorylated extracellular receptor kinase and phosphorylated AKT levels and an increase in myocardial apoptosis. Moreover, CMBK was required to allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al effects of both nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase activation and inhibition of the cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-5, ischemic preconditioning, and postconditioning regimens. To this end, after 4 weeks of reperfusion, fibrotic tissue increased and myocardial strain echocardiography was significantly compromised in CMBK-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lack of CMBK channels renders the heart more susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury, whereas the pathological events elicited by ischemia/reperfusion do not involve BK in vascular smooth muscle cells. BK seems to permit the protective effects triggered by cinaciguat, riociguat, and different phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al actions of ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning by a mechanism stemming primarily from cardiomyocytes. This study establishes mitochondrial CMBK channels as a promising target for limiting acute cardiac damage and adverse long-term events that occur after myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Direct Comparison of Cardiac Myosin-Binding Protein C With Cardiac Troponins for the Early Diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC) is a cardiac-restricted protein that is more abundant than cardiac troponins (cTn) and is released more rapidly after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We evaluated cMyC as an adjunct or alternative to cTn in the early diagnosis of AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unselected patients (N=1954) presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of AMI, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of cMyC, and high-sensitivity (hs) and standard-sensitivity cTn were measured at presentation. The final diagnosis of AMI was independently adjudicated using all available clinical and biochemical information without knowledge of cMyC. The prognostic end point was long-term mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Final diagnosis was AMI in 340 patients (17%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of cMyC at presentation were significantly higher in those with versus without AMI (median, 237 ng/L versus 13 ng/L, <i>P</i><0.001). Discriminatory power for AMI, as quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), was comparable for cMyC (AUC, 0.924), hs-cTnT (AUC, 0.927), and hs-cTnI (AUC, 0.922) and superior to cTnI measured by a contemporary sensitivity assay (AUC, 0.909). The combination of cMyC with hs-cTnT or standard-sensitivity cTnI (but not hs-cTnI) led to an increase in AUC to 0.931 (<i>P</i><0.0001) and 0.926 (<i>P</i>=0.003), respectively. Use of cMyC more accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed patients with a single blood test into rule-out or rule-in categories: Net Re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>cation Improvement +0.149 versus hs-cTnT, +0.235 versus hs-cTnI (<i>P</i><0.001). In early presenters (chest pain <3 h), the improvement in rule-in/rule-out <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>cation with cMyC was larger compared with hs-cTnT (Net Re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>cation Improvement +0.256) and hs-cTnI (Net Re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>cation Improvement +0.308; both <i>P</i><0.001). Comparing the C statistics, cMyC was superior to hs-cTnI and standard sensitivity cTnI (<i>P</i><0.05 for both) and similar to hs-cTnT at predicting death at 3 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>cMyC at presentation provides discriminatory power comparable to hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in the diagnosis of AMI and may perform favorably in patients presenting early after symptom onset.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.
